reportable segments 

we have three regional operating segments which are also our reportable segments

products and services 

our principal products and services include the following 



these products are sold primarily under our tradenames including trane ® and thermo king ®  

competitive conditions 

our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world due to the diversity of these products and services and the variety of markets served we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line and services they include wellestablished regional or specialized competitors as well as larger us and nonus corporations or divisions of larger companies 

the principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price quality delivery service and support technology and innovation we are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of hvac systems and services and transport temperature control products and services 

distribution 

our products are distributed by a number of methods which we believe are appropriate to the type of product us sales are made through branch sales offices distributors and dealers across the country nonus sales are made through numerous subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world 

operations by geographic area 

approximately 29 of our net revenues in 2021 were derived outside the us and we sold products in approximately 100 countries therefore the attendant risks of manufacturing or selling in a particular country such as currency devaluation nationalization and establishment of common markets may have an adverse impact on our nonus operations 

customers 

we have no customer that accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues in 2021 2020 or 2019 no material part of our business is dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers therefore the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

raw materials 

we manufacture many of the components included in our products which requires us to source a wide variety of commodities principal commodities such as steel copper and aluminum are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world primarily within the region where the products are manufactured we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future 

seasonality 

demand for certain of our products and services is influenced by weather conditions for instance sales in our commercial and residential hvac businesses historically tend to be higher in the second and third quarters of the year because this represents spring and summer in the us and other northern hemisphere markets which are the peak seasons for sales of air conditioning systems and services therefore results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unusual weather patterns or events could positively or negatively affect certain segments of our business and impact overall results of operations 

research and development 

we engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products enhance existing product effectiveness improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate in 2021 we spent 1935 million on research and development focused on product and system sustainability improvements such as increasing energy efficiency developing products that allow for use of lower global warming potential refrigerants reducing material content in products and designing products for circularity all new product development npd programs must complete a design for sustainability module within our npd process to ensure that every program has a positive impact on sustainability 

we also have a strong focus on sustaining activities which include costs incurred to reduce production costs improve existing products create custom solutions for customers and provide support to our manufacturing facilities we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development and sustaining activities as we look to maintain and improve our competitive position 

patents and licenses 

our intellectual property rights are important to our business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets proprietary technology technical data business processes and other confidential information although in aggregate we consider our intellectual property rights to be valuable to our operations we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single intellectual property right or any group of them in our opinion engineering production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our intellectual property rights 

backlog 

our backlog of orders believed to be firm at december 31 was as follows 



these backlog figures are based on orders received and only include amounts associated with our equipment and contracting and installation performance obligations a major portion of our residential products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock as a result we expect to ship a majority of the december 31 2021 backlog during 2022 however orders for specialized machinery or specific customer applications are submitted with extensive lead times and are often subject to revision and deferral and to a lesser extent cancellation or termination during the year ended december 31 2021 we experienced significant increases in end market demand for our sustainabilityfocused products and services resulting in a higher backlog of orders in the current year as compared to prior year in addition we are seeing industrywide supply chain and resource constraints impacting our ability to produce and ship product which we are proactively managing to the extent projects are delayed or there are additional supply chain and resource constraints the timing of our revenue could be affected 

environmental matters 

we continue to be dedicated to environmental and sustainability programs to minimize the use of natural resources and reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials from our manufacturing processes and to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities and offsite waste disposal facilities 

it is our policy to establish environmental reserves for investigation and remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made estimated liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations due to unknown environmental conditions changes in government laws and regulations and changes in cleanup technologies the environmental reserves are updated on a routine basis as remediation efforts progress and new information becomes available 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the environmental protection agency and similar state and international authorities we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites in most instances at multiparty sites our share of the liability is not material 

in estimating our liability at multiparty sites we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis 

for a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

separation of industrial segment businesses 

on february 29 2020 distribution date we completed our reverse morris trust transaction the transaction with gardner denver holdings inc gardner denver which changed its name to ingersoll rand inc ingersoll rand after the transaction whereby we distributed ingersollrand us holdco inc which contained our former industrial segment ingersoll rand industrial through a pro rata distribution the distribution to shareholders of record as of february 24 2020 ingersoll rand industrial then merged into a whollyowned subsidiary of ingersoll rand upon close of the transaction our existing shareholders received 501 of the shares of ingersoll rand common stock on a fullydiluted basis and gardner denver stockholders retained 499 of the shares of ingersoll rand on a fully diluted basis as a result our shareholders received 8824 shares of ingersoll rand common stock with respect to each share owned as of february 24 2020 in connection with the transaction we received a special cash payment of 19 billion 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we paid ingersoll rand 495 million to settle certain items related to the transaction this payment was related to working capital cash and indebtedness amounts as of the distribution date as well as funding levels related to pension plans nonqualified deferred compensation plans and retiree health benefits we recorded the settlement as a reduction to retained earnings during the first quarter of 2021 

after the distribution date we do not beneficially own any ingersoll rand industrial shares of common stock and no longer consolidate ingersoll rand industrial in our financial statements the historical results of ingersoll rand industrial are presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of earnings and consolidated statements of cash flows 

asbestosrelated matters 

on june 18 2020 petition date our indirect whollyowned subsidiaries aldrich and murray each filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter 11 of title 11 of the united states code the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of north carolina in charlotte the bankruptcy court as a result of the chapter 11 filings all asbestosrelated lawsuits against aldrich and murray have been stayed due to the imposition of a statutory automatic stay applicable in chapter 11 bankruptcy cases only aldrich and murray have filed for chapter 11 relief neither aldrichs whollyowned subsidiary 200 park inc 200 park murrays whollyowned subsidiary climatelabs llc climatelabs trane technologies plc nor its other subsidiaries the trane companies are part of the chapter 11 filings 

the goal of these chapter 11 filings is to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestosrelated claims in a manner beneficial to claimants aldrich and murray through court approval of a plan of reorganization that would create a trust pursuant to section 524g of the bankruptcy code establish claims resolution procedures for all current and future asbestosrelated claims against aldrich and murray and channel such claims to the trust for resolution in accordance with those procedures 

on september 24 2021 aldrich and murray filed the plan of reorganization the plan with the bankruptcy court the plan is supported by and reflects the agreement in principle reached with the courtappointed legal representative of future asbestos claimants the fcr  in connection with the plan  aldrich and murray filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to create a 2700 million trust intended to constitute a qualified settlement fund within the meaning of the treasury regulations under section 468b of the internal revenue code qsf the funds held in the qsf would be available to provide funding for the section 524g trust upon effectiveness of the plan 

on january 27 2022 the bankruptcy court granted the request to fund the qsf the qsf is expected to be funded in the first quarter of 2022 shortly after the bankruptcy court enters an order reflecting such approval and such order becomes final and nonappealable at this point in the chapter 11 cases of aldrich and murray it is not possible to predict whether the bankruptcy court will approve the terms of the plan what the extent of the asbestos liability will be or how long the chapter 11 cases will last the chapter 11 cases remain pending as of february 7 2022 

prior to the petition date certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries and former companies were named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in state and federal courts in virtually all of the suits a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants the vast majority of those claims allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products primarily pumps boilers and railroad brake shoes none of our existing or previouslyowned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos

 item 1a  risk factors 

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to a number of risks that could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k the risks set forth below are those we consider most significant we face other risks however that we do not currently perceive to be material which could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from our expectations you should evaluate all risks before you invest in our securities if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted in that case the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to economic conditions 

the covid19 global pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have already adversely impacted our business and could have a more material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we continue to closely monitor the impact of the covid19 global pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies including how it has and will impact our customers team members suppliers vendors business partners and distribution channels the covid19 global pandemic has created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption which may continue to affect our business operations and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

the covid19 global pandemic has caused certain disruptions to and shutdowns of our business and operations and could cause material disruptions to and shutdowns of our business and operations in the future as a result of among other things quarantines worker absenteeism as a result of illness or other factors social distancing measures and other travel healthrelated business or other restrictions these effects of the pandemic have created and exacerbated issues concerning the attraction and retention of talent globally our business and operations have been impacted globally resulting in lower revenues for some quarters supply chain delays and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements from time to time the covid19 global pandemic has also adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our suppliers and their manufacturers and our customers some of our purchases are from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of cost effectiveness uniqueness of design or product quality the effects of the covid19 global pandemic have exacerbated supply chain issues with these suppliers any delay in receiving critical supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

as a result of the effects of the covid19 global pandemic our costs have increased including the costs to address the health and safety of our employees our ability to obtain products or services from suppliers has been and may be adversely impacted and our ability to operate at certain locations has been and may be impacted and as a result our business financial condition and results of operations have been adversely impacted and could be materially adversely affected if the covid19 global pandemic continues or there are resurgences of covid19 and its variants 

the covid19 global pandemic also resulted in severe disruptions and volatility in financial markets which had a material adverse impact on some of our customers and suppliers a recurrence in volatility due to a resurgence in the covid19 global pandemic could impact our access to capital and credit markets notwithstanding the introduction of vaccines to combat the covid19 global pandemic and measures taken by governments to provide economic stimulus the severity of the pandemic’s impact on economies in the united states and around the world the potential length of the economic recovery and the longerterm economic impacts are uncertain the current and potential further outbreaks and spread of the covid19 global pandemic or other future pandemics could cause a delayed recovery a prolonged recession or future economic disruptions which could have a further adverse impact on our financial condition and operations 

vaccine mandates and testing requirements have been announced in jurisdictions where we operate our efforts to comply with these requirements could result in attrition and could impact our ability to successfully compete for talent our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities and our ability to service our customers in addition compliance and monitoring costs associated with these mandates could be significant 

the impact of the covid19 global pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in item 1a risk factors in our annual report on form 10k any of which could have a material effect on us this situation is continuing to evolve rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally these activities are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

• changes in local laws and regulations including potential imposition of currency restrictions new or changing tax laws and other restraints 

• limitation of ownership rights including expropriation of assets by a local government and limitation on the ability to repatriate earnings 

• sovereign debt crises and currency instability in developed and developing countries 

• trade protection measures such as import or export restrictions and requirements the imposition of burdensome tariffs and quotas or revocation or material modification of trade agreements 

• difficulty in staffing and managing global operations including supply chain disruptions which may be exacerbated by pandemics or other events affecting the supply of labor materials and components 

• difficulty of enforcing agreements collecting receivables and protecting assets through nonus legal systems 

• national and international conflict including war civil disturbances and terrorist acts and 

• recessions economic downturns price instability slowing economic growth and social and political instability 

these risks could increase our cost of doing business internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations limit our ability to sell products in certain markets and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

commodity shortages supply chain risks and price increases could adversely affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities particularly steel and nonferrous metals and thirdparty parts and components required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities and thirdparty parts and components could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs disruptions have occurred due to the covid19 pandemic capacity constraints labor shortages port congestion logistical problems and other issues some of these disruptions have resulted in supply chain constraints affecting our business including our ability to timely produce and ship our products the unavailability of some commodities and thirdparty parts and components could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in the prices of commodities and thirdparty parts and components or the impact of inflationary increases could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows conversely in the event there is deflation we may experience pressure from our customers to reduce prices there can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows while we may use financial derivatives or supplier price locks to hedge against this volatility by using these instruments we may potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in prices and could experience lower margins in periods of declining commodity prices in addition while hedging activity may minimize nearterm volatility of the commodity prices it would not protect us from longterm commodity price increases 

some of our purchases are from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of cost effectiveness uniqueness of design or product quality if these suppliers encounter financial or operating difficulties we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply 

we face significant competition in the markets that we serve 

the markets that we serve are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products there has been consolidation and new entrants including nontraditional competitors within our industries and there may be future consolidation and new entrants which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the competitive landscape in which we operate due to our global footprint we are competing worldwide with large companies and with smaller local operators who may have customer regulatory or economic advantages in the geographies in which they are located in addition some of our competitors may employ pricing and other strategies that are not traditional while we understand our markets and competitive landscape there is always the risk of disruptive technologies coming from companies that are not traditionally manufacturers or service providers of our products 

our growth is dependent in part on the timely development commercialization and acceptance of new and enhanced products and services 

we must timely develop and commercialize new and enhanced products and services in a rapidly changing technological and business environment in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business the development and commercialization of new products and the modification of existing products and services to meet customer demands require a significant investment of resources and an anticipation of the impact of new technologies and the ability to compete with others who may have superior resources in specific technology domains we cannot provide any assurance that any new or enhanced product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new or enhanced product or service will be accepted by our current and future markets failure to timely develop new and enhanced products and services that are accepted by these markets could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and long term credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategies 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit at interest rates and on terms that are acceptable to them could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world 

many of our nonus operations have a functional currency other than the us dollar and their results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes therefore our reported results will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 

we use derivative instruments to hedge those material exposures that cannot be naturally offset the instruments utilized are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

risks related to litigation 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business or the business operations of previouslyowned entities our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation contract claims or other commercial disputes product liability product defects and asbestosrelated matters that cannot be predicted with certainty moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against the total aggregate amount of losses sustained as a result of such proceedings and contingencies as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other events could affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the aldrich and murray chapter 11 cases involve various risks and uncertainties that could have a material effect on us 

on june 18 2020 our indirect whollyowned subsidiaries aldrich and murray each filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under the bankruptcy code in the bankruptcy court the goal of these chapter 11 filings is to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestosrelated claims in a manner beneficial to claimants aldrich and murray through court approval of a plan of reorganization that would create a trust pursuant to section 524g of the bankruptcy code establish claims resolution procedures for all current and future asbestosrelated claims against aldrich and murray and channel such claims to the trust for resolution in accordance with those procedures such a resolution if achieved would likely include a channeling injunction to enjoin asbestos claims resolved in the chapter 11 cases from being filed or pursued against us or our affiliates the chapter 11 cases remain pending as of february 7 2022 

certain of our subsidiaries have entered into funding agreements with aldrich and murray collectively the funding agreements pursuant to which those subsidiaries are obligated among other things to fund the costs and expenses of aldrich and murray during the pendency of the chapter 11 cases to the extent distributions from their respective subsidiaries are insufficient to do so and to provide an amount for the funding for a trust established pursuant to section 524g of the bankruptcy code to the extent that the other assets of aldrich and murray are insufficient to provide the requisite trust funding 

on august 26 2021 we announced that aldrich and murray reached an agreement in principle with the court appointed legal representative of the fcr in the bankruptcy proceedings the agreement in principle includes the key terms for the permanent resolution of all current and future asbestos claims against aldrich and murray asbestos claims pursuant to the plan as described further in note 21 “commitments and contingencies” and “item 1 legal proceedings” in this report the agreement in principle with the fcr is subject to final documentation and is conditioned on arrangements acceptable to aldrich and murray with respect to their asbestos insurance assets the current asbestos claimants the acc are not a party to the agreement in principle any settlement and its implementation in a plan of reorganization is subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court and there can be no assurance that the bankruptcy court will approve the agreement on the terms proposed 

on september 24 2021 aldrich and murray filed the plan with the bankruptcy court the plan is supported by and reflects the agreement in principle reached with the fcr in connection with the plan aldrich and murray filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to create a 2700 million trust intended to constitute a qsf the funds held in the qsf would be available to provide funding for the section 524g trust upon effectiveness of the plan 

on january 27 2022 the bankruptcy court granted the request to fund the qsf the qsf is expected to be funded in the first quarter of 2022 shortly after the bankruptcy court enters an order reflecting such approval and such order becomes final and nonappealable at this point in the chapter 11 cases of aldrich and murray it is not possible to predict whether the bankruptcy court will approve the terms of the plan what the extent of the asbestos liability will be or how long the chapter 11 cases will last 

there are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with these chapter 11 cases including among others those related to 

• the ultimate determination of the asbestos liability of aldrich and murray to be satisfied under a chapter 11 plan and the ability to consummate the settlement reached with the fcr 

• the outcome of negotiations with the acc and the fcr and other participants in the chapter 11 cases including insurers concerning among other things the size and structure of a potential section 524g trust to pay the asbestos liability of aldrich and murray and the means for funding that trust 

• the actions of representatives of the asbestos claimants including the accs pursuit of certain causes of action against us following the bankruptcy courts grant of the accs motion seeking standing to investigate and pursue 

certain causes of action at a hearing held on january 27 2022 and other potential actions by the acc in opposition to or otherwise inconsistent with the efforts by aldrich and murray to diligently prosecute the chapter 11 cases and ultimately seek bankruptcy court approval of a plan of reorganization 

• the decisions of the bankruptcy court relating to numerous substantive and procedural aspects of the chapter 11 cases including in connection with a proceeding by aldrich and murray to estimate their aggregate liability for asbestos claims following the bankruptcy courts grant of their motion seeking such a proceeding at a hearing held on january 27 2022 and other efforts by aldrich and murray to diligently prosecute the chapter 11 cases and ultimately seek bankruptcy court approval of a plan of reorganization whether such decisions are in response to actions of representatives of the asbestos claimants or otherwise 

• the risk that aldrich and murray may be unable to obtain the necessary approvals of the bankruptcy court or the united states district court for the western district of north carolina the district court of a plan of reorganization 

• the risk that any orders approving a plan of reorganization and issuing the channeling injunction do not become final 

• the terms and conditions of any plan of reorganization that is ultimately confirmed in the chapter 11 cases 

• delays in the confirmation or effective date of a plan of reorganization or the funding of the qsf due to factors beyond the company’s control 

• the risk that the ultimate amount required under any final plan of reorganization may exceed the amounts agreed to with the fcr in the plan 

• the risk that the insurance carriers do not support the plan the risk that the acc objects to the plan andor the motion to establish the qsf and 

• the decisions of appellate courts regarding approval of a plan of reorganization or relating to orders of the bankruptcy court or the district court that may be appealed 

the ability of aldrich and murray to successfully reorganize and resolve their asbestos liabilities will depend on various factors including their ability to reach agreements with representatives of the asbestos claimants on the terms of a plan of reorganization that satisfies all applicable legal requirements and to obtain the requisite court approvals of such plan and remains subject to the risks and uncertainties described above we cannot ensure that aldrich and murray can successfully reorganize nor can we give any assurances as to the amount of the ultimate obligations under the funding agreements or any plan of reorganization or the resulting impact on our financial condition results of operations or future prospects we also are unable to predict the timing of any of the foregoing matters or the timing for a resolution of the chapter 11 cases all of which could have an impact on us 

it also is possible that in the chapter 11 cases various parties will seek to bring and will be successful in bringing claims against us and other related parties including by raising allegations that we are liable for the asbestosrelated liabilities of aldrich and murray as set forth in certain pleadings filed by the acc in the chapter 11 cases although we believe we have no such responsibility for liabilities of aldrich and murray except indirectly through our obligation to provide funding to aldrich and murray under the terms of the funding agreements we cannot provide assurances that such claims will not be pursued 

in sum the outcome of the chapter 11 cases is uncertain and there is uncertainty as to what extent we may have to contribute to a section 524g trust under the funding agreements 

risks related to cybersecurity and technology 

we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are supported by third party vendors including cloudbased systems and managed service providers to manage and operate our business we invest in new information technology systems designed to improve our operations we have had failures of these systems in the past and may have failures of these systems in the future if these systems cease to function properly if these systems experience security breaches or disruptions or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

security breaches or disruptions of the technology systems infrastructure or products of the company or our vendors could negatively impact our business and financial results 

our information technology systems networks and infrastructure and technology embedded in certain of our control products have been and are vulnerable to cyber attacks and unauthorized security intrusions from time to time vulnerabilities in our products are discovered and updates are made available but customers are vulnerable until those updates are applied or other mitigating actions are taken by customers to protect their systems and networks like other large companies certain of our information technology systems and the systems of our vendors have been subject to computer viruses malicious code unauthorized access phishing attempts denialofservice attacks and other cyber attacks and we expect that we and our vendors will be subject to similar attacks in the future for example in the fourth quarter of 2021 a thirdparty provider that we use for time and attendance tracking experienced a ransomware event that affected our access to this software solution we activated our crisis management team and business continuity processes and were able to employ alternate methods for tracking time and attendance while the issue did not directly affect our operations or it systems the issue caused and continues to cause disruption and a reallocation of management’s time and attention to address the problem 

the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage information technology systems are constantly changing and evolving despite having instituted security policies and business continuity plans and implementing and regularly reviewing and updating processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access and requiring similar protections from our vendors the everevolving threats mean we are continually evaluating and adapting our systems and processes and ask our vendors to do the same and there is no guarantee that such systems and processes will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data hardware software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties sometimes contain defects in design or deployment or other problems that could unexpectedly result in security breaches or disruptions open source software components embedded into certain software that we use has in the past contained vulnerabilities and others may be discovered in the future such vulnerabilities can expose our systems to malware or allow third party access to data while these issues are not specific to our company we are required to take action when such vulnerabilities are identified including patching and modification to certain of our products and enterprise systems to date there has been no material business impact from such vulnerabilities but we continue to monitor these issues and our responses are ongoing our systems networks and certain of our control products and those of our vendors are vulnerable to system damage malicious attacks from hackers employee errors or misconduct viruses power and utility outages and other catastrophic events any of these incidents could cause significant harm to our business by negatively impacting our business operations compromising the security of our proprietary information or the personally identifiable information of our customers employees and business partners exposing us to litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties fines fees or liabilities such events could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could damage our reputation which could adversely affect our business our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to a cybersecurity attack or disruptions resulting from such attacks customers are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands 

data privacy and protection laws are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges 

the regulatory environment surrounding data privacy and protection is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses and geographic areas we are required to comply with complex regulations when collecting transferring and using personal data which increases our costs affects our competitiveness and can expose us to substantial fines or other penalties 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our competitive position 

our intellectual property ip rights are important to our business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets proprietary technology technical data business processes and other confidential information although in aggregate we consider our intellectual property rights to be valuable to our operations we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single intellectual property right or any group of them in our opinion engineering production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our patents andor licenses 

nonetheless this intellectual property may be subject to challenge infringement invalidation or circumvention by third parties despite extensive security measures our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems employee theft or theft by private parties or foreign actors including those affiliated with or controlled by state actors our business and competitive position could be harmed by such events our ability to protect our intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are inadequate or undeveloped our inability to enforce our ip rights under any of these circumstances could have an impact on our competitive position and business 

risks related to regulatory matters 

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption antihuman trafficking antibribery export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any violations of law or improper conduct could damage our reputation and depending on the circumstances subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects financial condition results of operations cash flows and the market value of our stock 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including among others laws related to the environment and health and safety we have made and will be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations any violations of applicable laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties fines or other sanctions changes in current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services the us federal government and various states and municipalities have enacted or may enact legislation intended to deny government contracts to us companies that reincorporate outside of the us or have reincorporated outside of the us or may take other actions negatively impacting such companies if we are unable to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations interpretations of applicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 

global climate change and related regulations could negatively affect our business 

climate change presents immediate and longterm risks to our company and to our customers with the risks expected to increase over time our products and operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our international operations including with respect to the use storage and dependence upon refrigerants which are considered greenhouse gases refrigerants are essential to many of our products and there is concern regarding the global warming potential of such materials as such national regional and international regulations and policies are being implemented to curtail their use some of these regulations could have a negative competitive impact on our company by requiring us to make costly changes to our products as regulations reduce the use of the current class of widely used refrigerants we are developing and selling our next generation products that utilize lower global warming potential solutions there can be no assurance that climate change or environmental regulation or deregulation will not have a negative competitive impact on our ability to sell these products or that economic returns will match the investment that we are making in new product development we face increasing complexity related to product design the use of regulated materials the associated energy consumption and efficiency related to the use of products the transportation and shipping of products climate change regulations and the reuse recycling andor disposal of products and their components at endofuse or useful life as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to our transition to a more circular economy there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty such regulatory uncertainty extends to future incentives for energy efficient buildings and vehicles and costs of compliance which may impact the demand for our products obsolescence of our products and our results of operations 

our climate commitment requires us to offer a full line of next generation products by 2030 without compromising safety or energy efficiency additionally in 2019 we announced our 2030 commitment which targets reducing one gigaton – one billion metric tons – of carbon emissions co2e from our customers’ footprint by 2030 while we are committed to pursuing these sustainability objectives there can be no assurance that we will successfully achieve our commitments failure to meet these commitments could result in reputational harm to our company changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory compliance risks and costs 

risks related to our business operations 

our business strategy includes acquiring businesses product lines technologies and capabilities plants and other assets entering into joint ventures and making investments that complement our existing businesses we also occasionally divest businesses that we own we may not identify acquisition or joint venture candidates or investment opportunities at the same rate as the past acquisitions dispositions joint ventures and investments that we identify could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition and divestiture of strategic businesses and product lines technologies and capabilities plants and other assets joint ventures and investments with the potential to among other things strengthen our industry position to enhance our existing set of product and services offerings to increase productivity and efficiencies to grow revenues earnings and cash flow to help us stay competitive or to reduce costs there can be no assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable candidates in the future that we will consummate these transactions at rates similar to the past or that completed transactions will be successful strategic transactions may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows such transactions involve numerous other risks including 

• diversion of management time and attention from daily operations 

• difficulties integrating acquired businesses technologies and personnel into our business including doing so without high costs 

• difficulties in obtaining and verifying the financial statements and other business and other due diligence information of acquired businesses 

• inability to obtain required regulatory approvals andor required financing on favorable terms 

• potential loss of key employees key contractual relationships or key customers of either acquired businesses or our business 

• assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen or undisclosed liabilities of acquired businesses and exposure to regulatory sanctions 

• inheriting internal control deficiencies 

• dilution of interests of holders of our common shares through the issuance of equity securities or equitylinked securities and 

• in the case of joint ventures and other investments interests that diverge from those of our partners without the ability to direct the management and operations of the joint venture or investment in the manner we believe most appropriate to achieve the expected value 

any acquisitions divestitures joint ventures or investments may ultimately harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows there are additional risks related to our reverse morris trust transaction see risks related to the transactions for more information 

natural disasters epidemics or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and may not be fully covered by insurance 

the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events including hurricanes fires earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks or other catastrophic events in the us or in other countries in which we operate or are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters power outages health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our plants temporary or longterm disruption of our operations by causing business interruptions material scarcity price volatility or supply chain disruptions climate change is a risk multiplier with respect to these physical disasters in both frequency and severity and may affect our global business operations as a result existing insurance arrangements may not provide full protection for the costs that may arise from such events particularly if such events are catastrophic in nature or occur in combination the occurrence of any of these events could increase our insurance and other operating costs or harm our sales in affected areas 

our business may be adversely affected by temporary work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force 

certain of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils we experience from timetotime temporary work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force and some of these events could result in significant increases in our cost of labor impact our productivity or damage our reputation additionally a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available stoppages by employees of our customers could also result in reduced demand for our products some of these issues have been and may in the future be exacerbated by effects of the covid19 global pandemic as described in our risk factor   the covid19 global pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have already adversely impacted our business and could have a more material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations  

risks relating to tax matters 

changes in tax or other laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under us or nonus laws or adverse determinations by taxing or other governmental authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the taxes associated with our operations and corporate structure could be impacted by changes in tax or other laws treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the us or nonus tax or other governmental authorities while the tax cuts and jobs act tcja was passed in the us in 2017 further guidance regulations and technical corrections pertaining to tcja continue to be issued by the tax authorities some of which may have retroactive application we continue to monitor and review new guidance and regulations as they are issued as any changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements in addition the us congress is actively engaged in formulating new legislative proposals any future legislative changes to the tax laws and judicial or regulatory interpretation thereof the geographic mix of earnings changes in overall profitability and other factors could also materially impact our effective tax rate 

we continue to monitor for other tax changes us including state and local and nonus related which can also adversely impact our overall tax burden from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws regulations or interpretations thereof of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted or implemented could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations moreover the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd has released proposals to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting including pillar one and pillar two such that tax laws in countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely impact us the oecd and the european commission have also committed to implementing a global minimum tax rate proposed 15 minimum tax rate agreed upon by over 135 jurisdictions including ireland full details are uncertain and timing is currently proposed to be january 1 2023 as a consequence our global effective tax rate could be materially impacted by such legislation or any resulting local country legislation enacted in response to any potential global minimum tax rates 

finally the european commission has been very active in investigating whether various tax regimes or private tax rulings provided by a country to particular taxpayers may constitute state aid we cannot predict the outcome of any of these potential changes or investigations in any of the jurisdictions but if any of the above occurs and impacts us this could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

while we monitor proposals and other developments that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals or regulatory changes are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax or other laws is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding the shareholders decision to reorganize in ireland limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

in addition tax authorities periodically review tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate these examinations on their own or any subsequent litigation related to the examinations may result in additional taxes or penalties against us if the ultimate result of these audits differs from our original or adjusted estimates they could have a material impact on our tax provision 

risks related to our reverse morris trust transaction 

on the distribution date we completed the transaction with gardner denver which changed its name to ingersoll rand after the transaction whereby we distributed ingersollrand us holdco inc which contained ingersoll rand industrial through the distribution to our shareholders of record as of february 24 2020 ingersoll rand industrial then merged with a whollyowned subsidiary of ingersoll rand upon close of the transaction our existing shareholders received approximately 501 of the shares of ingersoll rand common stock on a fullydiluted basis and gardner denver stockholders retained approximately 499 of the shares of ingersoll rand on a fully diluted basis as a result our shareholders received 08824 shares of ingersoll rand common stock with respect to each share of our stock owned as of february 24 2020 in connection with the transaction we received a special cash payment of 19 billion 

if the distribution as part of our reverse morris trust transaction is determined to be taxable for irish tax purposes significant irish tax liabilities may arise for our shareholders 

we received an opinion from irish revenue regarding certain tax matters associated with the distribution as well as a legal opinion from our irish counsel arthur cox regarding certain irish tax consequences for shareholders of the distribution for our shareholders that are not resident or ordinarily resident in ireland for irish tax purposes and that do not hold their shares in connection with a trade or business carried on by such shareholders through an irish branch or agency we consider based on both opinions taken together that no adverse irish tax consequences for such shareholders should have arisen these opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations notwithstanding the opinion from irish revenue irish revenue could ultimately determine on audit that the distribution is taxable for irish tax purposes for example if it determines that any of these facts assumptions or representations are not correct or have been violated a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment and is not binding on irish revenue or the courts and irish revenue or the courts may not agree with the legal opinion in addition the legal opinion is based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable for irish tax purposes certain of our shareholders and we could have significant irish tax liabilities as a result of the distribution and there could be a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions do not qualify as taxfree under sections 355 and 368a of the code including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of the company or ingersoll rand inc then the company and our shareholders may be required to pay substantial us federal income taxes and ingersoll rand inc may be obligated to indemnify the company for such taxes imposed on the company 

we received an opinion from our us tax counsel paul weiss rifkind wharton  garrison llp paul weiss substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the distribution together with certain related transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution and taking into account the merger of ingersoll rand industrial with the whollyowned subsidiary of ingersoll rand will qualify as a taxfree transaction under sections 368a 361 and 355 of the code with the result that we and our shareholders will not recognize any gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff the opinion of our counsel was based on among other things certain representations and assumptions as to factual matters made by ingersoll rand ingersoll rand industrial and the company the failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true correct and complete in all material respects could adversely affect the validity of the opinion of counsel an opinion of counsel represents counsel’s best legal judgment is not binding on the internal revenue service irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinion will be based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution andor related internal transactions in anticipation of the distribution ultimately are determined to be taxable we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities which could cause a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods although if this determination resulted from certain actions taken by ingersoll rand industrial or ingersoll rand inc ingersoll rand inc would be required to bear the cost of any resultant tax liability pursuant to the terms of the tax matters agreement 

the distribution will be taxable to the company pursuant to section 355e of the code if there is a 50 or greater change in ownership of either the company or ingersoll rand industrial directly or indirectly including through such a change in ownership of ingersoll rand inc as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution a section 355e change of ownership would not make the distribution taxable to our shareholders but instead may result in corporatelevel taxable gain to certain of our subsidiaries because our shareholders will collectively be treated as owning more than 50 of the ingersoll rand inc common stock following the merger the merger alone should not cause the distribution to be taxable to our subsidiaries under section 355e however section 355e might apply if other acquisitions of stock of the company before or after the merger or of ingersoll rand inc before or after the merger are considered to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution together with certain related transactions if section 355e applied certain of our subsidiaries might recognize a very substantial amount of taxable gain although if this applied as a result of certain actions taken by ingersoll rand industrial ingersoll rand inc or certain specified ingersoll rand inc stockholders ingersoll rand inc would be required to bear the cost of any resultant tax liability under section 355e pursuant to the terms of the tax matters agreement 

if the merger does not qualify as a taxfree reorganization under section 368a of the code our shareholders may be required to pay substantial us federal income taxes 

we have received an opinion from paul weiss and ingersoll rand inc has received an opinion from their counsel simpson thacher  bartlett llp substantially to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the code with the result that us holders of ingersoll rand industrial common stock who received ingersoll rand common stock in the merger will not recognize any gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes except with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares of ingersoll rand common stock these opinions were based upon among other things certain representations and assumptions as to factual matters made by ingersoll rand inc the company ingersoll rand industrial and the merger subsidiary used by ingersoll rand inc the failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true correct and complete in all material respects could adversely affect the validity of the opinions an opinion of counsel represents counsel’s best legal judgment is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinions will be based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the merger were taxable us holders of ingersoll rand industrial would be considered to have made a taxable sale of their ingersoll rand industrial common stock to ingersoll rand inc and such us holders of ingersoll rand industrial would generally recognize taxable gain or loss on their receipt of ingersoll rand inc common stock in the merger 

risks related to our irish domicile 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions indemnification of directors and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states in addition irish law does not allow for any form of legal proceedings directly equivalent to the class action available in the united states 

irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemptive rights with respect to any particular allotment of shares under irish law we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares including shares that are part of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital in addition unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders when an irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a prorata basis if we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations our ability to issue shares or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 25 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders resident in the united states will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could have an adverse impact on the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of our shares will generally not be subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in trane technologies plc 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in trane technologies plc 




 item 1b   unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2   properties 

as of december 31 2021 we owned or leased approximately 27 million square feet of space worldwide manufacturing and assembly operations are conducted in 35 plants across the world we also maintain various warehouses offices and repair centers throughout the world the majority of our plant facilities are owned by us with the remainder under longterm lease arrangements we believe that our plants have been well maintained are generally in good condition and are suitable for conducting our business 

the locations by segment of our principal plant facilities at december 31 2021 were as follows 






 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we are involved in a variety of lawsuits claims and legal proceedings including those related to the bankruptcy proceedings for aldrich and murray commercial and contract disputes employment matters product liability and product defect claims asbestosrelated claims environmental liabilities intellectual property disputes and taxrelated matters in our opinion pending legal matters are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition liquidity or cash flows 

asbestosrelated matters 

on the petition date aldrich and murray each filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code as a result of the chapter 11 filings all asbestosrelated lawsuits against aldrich and murray have been stayed only aldrich and murray have filed for chapter 11 relief neither aldrichs whollyowned subsidiary 200 park murrays whollyowned subsidiary climatelabs trane technologies plc nor the trane companies are part of the chapter 11 filings 

the goal of these chapter 11 filings is to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestosrelated claims in a manner beneficial to claimants aldrich and murray through court approval of a plan of reorganization that would create a trust pursuant to section 524g of the bankruptcy code establish claims resolution procedures for all current and future asbestosrelated claims against aldrich and murray and channel such claims to the trust for resolution in accordance with those procedures such a resolution if achieved would likely include a channeling injunction to enjoin asbestos claims resolved in the chapter 11 cases from being filed or pursued against us or our affiliates 

on august 26 2021 we announced that aldrich and murray reached an agreement in principle with the fcr in the bankruptcy proceedings the agreement includes the key terms for the permanent resolution of all current and future asbestos claims against aldrich and murray pursuant to the plan under the agreed terms the plan would create a trust pursuant to section 524g of the bankruptcy code and establish claims resolution procedures for the asbestos claims on the effective date of the plan aldrich and murray would fund the trust with 5450 million comprised of 5400 million in cash and a promissory note to be issued by aldrich and murray to the trust in the principal amount of 50 million and the asbestos claims would be channeled to the trust for resolution in accordance with the claims resolution procedures following the effective date of the plan aldrich and murray would have no further obligations with respect to the asbestos claims the fcr has agreed to support such plan the agreement in principle with the fcr is subject to final documentation and is conditioned on arrangements acceptable to aldrich and murray with respect to their asbestos insurance assets it is currently contemplated that the asbestos insurance assets of aldrich and murray would be contributed to the trust and that in consideration of their cash contribution to the trust aldrich and murray would have the exclusive right to pursue collect and retain all insurance reimbursements available in connection with the resolution of asbestos claims by the trust the acc is not a party to the agreement in principle any settlement and its implementation in a plan of reorganization is subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court and there can be no assurance that the bankruptcy court will approve the agreement on the terms proposed 

on september 24 2021 aldrich and murray filed the plan with the bankruptcy court the plan is supported by and reflects the agreement in principle reached with the fcr  in connection with the plan  aldrich and murray filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to create a 2700 million trust intended to constitute a qsf the funds held in the qsf would be available to provide funding for the section 524g trust upon effectiveness of the plan 

on january 27 2022 the bankruptcy court granted the request to fund the qsf the qsf is expected to be funded in the first quarter of 2022 shortly after the bankruptcy court enters an order reflecting such approval and such order becomes final and nonappealable at this point in the chapter 11 cases of aldrich and murray it is not possible to predict whether the bankruptcy court will approve the terms of the plan what the extent of the asbestos liability will be or how long the chapter 11 cases will last the chapter 11 cases remain pending as of february 7 2022 

prior to the petition date certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries and former companies were named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in state and federal courts in virtually all of the suits a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants the vast majority of those claims allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products primarily pumps boilers and railroad brake shoes none of our existing or previouslyowned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos

significant events 

covid19 global pandemic 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide during the first half of 2020 the covid19 global pandemic adversely impacted our business globally including but not limited to lower end customer demand certain supply chain delays temporary facility closures and limitations of our workforce to essential crews only in response we proactively initiated cost cutting actions and actively managed our supply chain in an effort to mitigate the impact of the global pandemic on our business despite the challenges set forth by the covid19 global pandemic we continued to sell install and service our products invest in our businesses develop and launch new products and deliver innovative customer solutions for electrification of heating cooling and transport enhanced indoor air quality and precise temperature control along the full vaccine cold chain

reorganization of aldrich and murray 

on the petition date our indirect whollyowned subsidiaries aldrich and murray each filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under the bankruptcy code as a result of the chapter 11 filings all asbestosrelated lawsuits against aldrich and murray have been stayed due to the imposition of a statutory automatic stay applicable in chapter 11 bankruptcy cases only aldrich and murray have filed for chapter 11 relief neither aldrichs whollyowned subsidiary 200 park murrays whollyowned subsidiary climatelabs nor the trane companies are part of the chapter 11 filings 

the goal of these chapter 11 filings is to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestosrelated claims in a manner beneficial to claimants aldrich and murray through court approval of a plan of reorganization that would create a trust pursuant to section 524g of the bankruptcy code establish claims resolution procedures for all current and future asbestosrelated claims against aldrich and murray and channel such claims to the trust for resolution in accordance with those procedures 

aldrich and its whollyowned subsidiary 200 park and murray and its whollyowned subsidiary climatelabs were deconsolidated as of the petition date and their respective assets and liabilities were derecognized from our consolidated financial statements amounts derecognized in 2020 primarily related to the legacy asbestosrelated liabilities and asbestosrelated insurance recoveries and 417 million of cash 

as a result of the deconsolidation we recognized an aggregate loss of 249 million in our consolidated statements of earnings during the year ended december 31 2020 a gain of 09 million related to murray and its whollyowned subsidiary climatelabs was recorded within other income expense net and a loss of 258 million related to aldrich and its whollyowned subsidiary 200 park was recorded within discontinued operations net of tax  additionally the deconsolidation resulted in an investing cash outflow of 417 million in our consolidated statements of cash flows of which 108 million was recorded within continuing operations during the year ended december 31 2020 

during the year ended december 31 2021 in connection with the agreement in principle reached by aldrich and murray with the fcr and the motion to create a 2700 million qsf we recorded a charge of 212 million to increase our funding agreement liability to 2700 million the corresponding charge was bifurcated between other income expense net of 72 million relating to murray and discontinued operations of 140 million relating to aldrich 

on january 27 2022 the bankruptcy court granted the request to fund the qsf which is expected to be funded in the first quarter of 2022 shortly after the bankruptcy court enters an order reflecting such approval and such order becomes final and nonappealable therefore as we expect to fund the qsf shortly after the bankruptcy court enters the order reflecting its approval we reclassified our 2700 million funding agreement liability to accrued expenses and other current liabilities at december 31 2021  at this point in the chapter 11 cases of aldrich and murray it is not possible to predict whether the bankruptcy court will approve the terms of the plan what the extent of the asbestos liability will be or how long the chapter 11 cases will last the chapter 11 cases remain pending as of february 7 2022

trends and economic events 

we are a global corporation with worldwide operations as a global business our operations are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic factors as well as political and social factors wherever we operate or do business our geographic diversity and the breadth of our product and services portfolios have helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results 

given our broad range of products manufactured and geographic markets served management uses a variety of factors to predict the outlook for our company we monitor key competitors and customers in order to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future we regularly perform detailed evaluations of the different market segments we are serving to proactively detect trends and to adapt our strategies accordingly in addition we believe our order rates are indicative of future revenue and thus are a key measure of anticipated performance 

current economic conditions have shown improvement but remain mixed across our end markets the covid19 global pandemic continues to impact both the global hvac and transport end markets as industrywide supply chain and resource constraints exist as vaccine distribution and administration expands we expect market conditions to continue improving across the geographies where we serve our customers 

we believe we have a solid foundation of global brands that are highly differentiated in all of our major product lines our geographic and product diversity coupled with our large installed product base provides growth opportunities within our service and corresponding parts and replacement revenue streams in addition we are investing substantial resources to innovate and develop new products and services which we expect will drive our future growth 

results of operations

net revenues 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 135 or 16817 million compared with the same period of 2020 the components of the period change were as follows 



the increase in net revenues was primarily driven by increased end customer demand as a result of improved economic conditions as it relates to the covid19 global pandemic compared to the full year of 2020 coupled with pricing increases within all of our segments to offset significant material and freight inflation and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation also during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 we completed three channel acquisitions two were completed in the americas segment and the third was completed within the emea segment further driving an increase in net revenues as compared to the prior year refer to “results by segment” below for a discussion of net revenues by segment 

gross profit margin 

gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 110 basis points to 316 compared to 305 for the same period of 2020 primarily due to price realization and productivity benefits partially offset by increased direct material freight and other inflation 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 77 or 1757 million compared with the same period of 2020 the increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by higher compensation and employee benefits due to headcount growth higher incentive compensation and lower cost in the prior year due to delays in merit increases and employee furloughs in certain regions partially offset by lower spending on restructuring and transformation initiatives however selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 decreased 90 basis points from 182 to 173 primarily due to higher revenues yearoveryear 

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2021 decreased by 60 or 150 million compared with the same period of 2020 primarily due to the repayments of 1250 million of 9000 debentures in august 2021 3000 million of 2900 senior notes in february 2021 and 2020 interest costs related to the 3000 million of 2625 senior notes which were repaid in april 2020

provision for income taxes 

the 2021 effective tax rate was 186 which was lower than the us statutory rate of 21 due to a 214 million reduction in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets primarily related to foreign tax credits as a result of an increase in current year foreign source income excess tax benefits from employee sharebased payments and earnings in nonus jurisdictions which in aggregate have a lower effective tax rate these amounts were partially offset by the recognition of a net 116 million tax expense related to a prepayment of an intercompany obligation us state and local taxes and certain nondeductible employee expenses revenues from nonus jurisdictions accounted for approximately 29 of our total 2021 revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income was earned and taxed outside the us at rates ranging from 0 to 38 when comparing the results of multiple reporting periods among other factors the mix of earnings between us and foreign jurisdictions can cause variability in our overall effective tax rate 

the 2020 effective tax rate was 230 which was higher than the us statutory rate of 21 due to a 365 million noncash charge related to the establishment of valuation allowances on net deferred tax assets primarily net operating losses in certain tax jurisdictions and the writeoff of a carryforward tax attribute as a result of the completion of the transaction us state and local taxes and certain nondeductible employee expenses these amounts were partially offset by excess tax benefits from employee sharebased payments a 140 million benefit primarily related to a reduction in valuation allowances on deferred taxes related to net operating losses as a result of a planned restructuring in a nonus tax jurisdiction and foreign tax credits as a result of revised projections of future foreign source income and earnings in nonus jurisdictions which in aggregate have a lower effective tax rate the impact of the changes in the valuation allowances and the writeoff of the carryforward tax attribute increased the effective tax rate by 17 revenues from nonus jurisdictions accounted for approximately 28 of our total 2020 revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income was earned and taxed outside the us at rates ranging from 0 to 38 when comparing the results of multiple reporting periods among other factors the mix of earnings between us and foreign jurisdictions can cause variability in our overall effective tax rate

• our asia pacific segment innovates for customers throughout the asia pacific region the asia pacific segment encompasses heating and cooling systems services and solutions for commercial buildings and transport refrigeration systems and solutions 

management measures operating performance based on net earnings excluding interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization restructuring unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations segment adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda is not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures used by other companies and should not be considered a substitute for net earnings or other results reported in accordance with gaap we believe segment adjusted ebitda provides the most relevant measure of profitability as well as earnings power and the ability to generate cash this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business and we use this measure for business planning purposes segment adjusted ebitda also provides a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods and our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes to service debt and to undertake capital expenditures because it eliminates noncash charges such as depreciation and amortization expense 

the following discussion compares our results for each of our three reportable segments for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020

segment adjusted ebitda margin for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 100 basis points to 183 compared to 173 for the same period of 2020 primarily due to price realization productivity benefits and higher volumes which outpaced direct material freight and other costs driven by inflation and inefficiencies from strained supply chains

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities in doing so we review and analyze our current cash on hand the number of days our sales are outstanding inventory turns capital expenditure commitments and income tax payments our cash requirements primarily consist of the following 

• funding of working capital 

• debt service requirements 

• funding of capital expenditures 

• dividend payments 

• funding of acquisitions joint ventures and equity investments 

• share repurchases 

our primary sources of liquidity include cash balances on hand cash flows from operations proceeds from debt offerings commercial paper and borrowing availability under our existing credit facilities we earn a significant amount of our operating income in jurisdictions where it is deemed to be permanently reinvested our most prominent jurisdiction of operation is the us we expect existing cash and cash equivalents available to the us operations the cash generated by our us operations our committed credit lines as well as our expected ability to access the capital and debt markets will be sufficient to fund our us operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future in addition we expect existing nonus cash and cash equivalents and the cash generated by our nonus operations will be sufficient to fund our nonus operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future the maximum aggregate amount of unsecured commercial paper notes available to be issued on a private placement basis under the commercial paper program is 20 billion of which we had no outstanding balance as of december 31 2021 

as of december 31 2021 we had 21592 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand of which 14618 million was held by nonus subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries are generally available for use in our us operations via intercompany loans equity infusions or via distributions from direct or indirectly owned nonus subsidiaries for which we do not assert permanent reinvestment as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act in 2017 additional repatriation opportunities to access cash and cash equivalents held by nonus subsidiaries have been created in general repatriation of cash to the us can be completed with no significant incremental us tax however to the extent that we repatriate funds from nonus subsidiaries for which we assert permanent reinvestment to fund our us operations we would be required to accrue and pay applicable nonus taxes as of december 31 2021 we currently have no plans to repatriate funds from subsidiaries for which we assert permanent reinvestment 

share repurchases are made from time to time in accordance with managements balanced capital allocation strategy subject to market conditions and regulatory requirements in february 2021 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 billion of our ordinary shares under the 2021 authorization upon completion of the prior share repurchase program which authorized the repurchase of up to 15 billion of our ordinary shares 2018 authorization during the year ended december 31 2021 we repurchased and canceled 11 billion of our ordinary shares thus completing the 2018 authorization and initiated repurchases under the 2021 authorization of 6002 million of our ordinary shares leaving approximately 14 billion remaining under the 2021 authorization additionally through january 31 2022 we repurchased approximately 350 million of our ordinary shares under the 2021 authorization in february 2022 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 30 billion of our ordinary shares under a new share repurchase program 2022 authorization upon completion of the 2021 authorization 

we expect to pay a competitive and growing dividend in february 2021 we announced an 11 increase in our quarterly share dividend from 053 to 059 per ordinary share or 236 per share annualized all four 2021 quarterly dividends were paid during the year ended december 31 2021 in february 2022 our board of directors declared an increase in our quarterly share dividend by 14 from 059 to 067 per ordinary share or 236 to 268 per share annualized starting in the first quarter of 2022 

we continue to actively manage and strengthen our business portfolio to meet the current and future needs of our customers we achieve this partly through engaging in research and development and sustaining activities and partly through acquisitions sustaining activities include costs incurred to reduce production costs improve existing products create custom solutions for customers and provide support to our manufacturing facilities our research and development and sustaining costs account for approximately two percent of annual net revenues each year we make investments in new product development and new technology innovation as they are key factors in achieving our strategic objectives as a leader in the climate sector in addition we make investments in renewable energy production for example we invested in onsite solar energy generation at three of our facilities  trenton nj columbia sc and taicang china  to benefit from operational and cost consistency which is especially important in parts of the world with uncertain electricity prices and availability during the fourth quarter of 2021 we completed installation of a photovoltaic pv system at our zhongshan china facility which will begin generating solar electricity in 2022 these projects did not result in material expenditures for the year ended december 31 2021 we continue to look for similar improvement opportunities including but not limited to increasing energy efficiency developing products that allow for use of lower global warming potential refrigerants reducing material content in products and designing products for circularity all npd programs must complete a design for sustainability module within our npd process to ensure that every program has a positive impact on sustainability we also focus on partnering with our suppliers and technology providers to align their investment decisions with our technical requirements 

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely conduct discussions evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions divestitures joint ventures and equity investments since 2019 we have acquired several businesses entered into joint ventures and invested in companies that complement existing products and services further enhancing our product portfolio during the year ended december 31 2021 we deployed capital of approximately 340 million attributable to acquisitions and equity investments in addition during the year ended december 31 2020 we completed a reverse morris trust transaction with ingersoll rand whereby we separated ingersoll rand industrial from our business portfolio transforming the company into a global climate innovator we recognized separationrelated costs of 1142 million during the year ended december 31 2020 these expenditures were incurred in order to facilitate the transaction and are included within discontinued operations net of tax  

we incur ongoing costs associated with restructuring initiatives intended to result in improved operating performance profitability and working capital levels actions associated with these initiatives may include workforce reductions improving manufacturing productivity realignment of management structures and rationalizing certain assets post separation we committed to reduce costs by 190 million through 2021 and an additional 110 million by 2023 for a total of 300 million in total annual savings under our transformation initiatives in order to achieve these cost savings we anticipate to incur costs up to 150 million through 2022 we currently have incurred approximately 126 million cumulatively through december 31 2021 we believe that our existing cash flow committed credit lines and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to fund share repurchases dividends research and development sustaining activities business portfolio changes and ongoing restructuring actions 

certain of our subsidiaries entered into funding agreements with aldrich and murray pursuant to which those subsidiaries are obligated among other things to pay the costs and expenses of aldrich and murray during the pendency of the chapter 11 cases to the extent distributions from their respective subsidiaries are insufficient to do so and to provide an amount for the funding for a trust established pursuant to section 524g of the bankruptcy code to the extent that the other assets of aldrich and murray are insufficient to provide the requisite trust funding during the third quarter of 2021 aldrich and murray filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to create a 270 million qsf the funds held in the qsf would be available to provide funding for the section 524g trust upon effectiveness of the plan on january 27 2022 the bankruptcy court granted the request to fund the qsf the qsf is expected to be funded in the first quarter of 2022 shortly after the bankruptcy court enters an order reflecting such approval and such order becomes final and nonappealable at this point in the chapter 11 cases of aldrich and murray it is not possible to predict whether the bankruptcy court will approve the terms of the plan what the extent of the asbestos liability will be or how long the chapter 11 cases will last 

as the covid19 global pandemic impacts both the broader economy and our operations we will continue to assess our liquidity needs and our ability to access capital markets a continued worldwide disruption could materially affect economies and financial markets worldwide resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms and otherwise adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations see part i item 1a risk factors for more information

free cash flow 

free cash flow is a nongaap measure and defined as net cash provided by used in continuing operating activities  less capital expenditures plus cash payments for restructuring and transformation costs this measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with managements assessment of our operating cash flow performance the most comparable gaap measure to free cash flow is net cash provided by used in continuing operating activities  free cash flow may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures used by other companies and should not be considered a substitute for net cash provided by used in continuing operating activities in accordance with gaap 

a reconciliation of net cash provided by used in continuing operating activities to free cash flow the years ended december 31 is as follows 



1 represents a nongaap measure

summarized statements of earnings 



summarized balance sheet 



critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from these estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

• goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets – we have significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions these assets are tested and reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of an asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the asset in addition an interim impairment test is completed upon a triggering event or when there is a reorganization of reporting structure or disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit 

the determination of estimated fair value requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows including profit margins longterm forecasts discount rates and terminal growth rates we developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

annual goodwill impairment test 

impairment of goodwill is assessed at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test for those reporting units that bypass or fail the qualitative assessment the test compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair value is determined using three valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model an income approach a marketadjusted multiple of earnings and revenues a market approach and a similar transactions method also a market approach the discounted cash flow approach relies on our estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing growth and margins with due consideration given to forecasting risk the multiple of earnings and revenues approach reflects the markets expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publicly traded companies and the subject reporting units the similar transactions method considers prices paid in transactions that have recently occurred in our industry or in related industries these valuation techniques are weighted 50 40 and 10 respectively 

other indefinitelived intangible assets 

impairment of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is first assessed using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired this assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset for those indefinitelived assets where it is required a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology income approach which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value would be recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess 

• business combinations  acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination are recorded using the acquisition method of accounting we include the operating results of acquired entities from their respective dates of acquisition we recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed including contingent consideration relating to potential earnout provisions and any noncontrolling interest as of the acquisition date fair value the valuation of intangible assets is determined using an income approach methodology we use assumptions to value the intangible assets including projected future revenues customer attrition rates royalty rates tax rates and discount rates the excess if any of total consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest is recognized as goodwill costs incurred as a result of a business combination other than costs related to the issuance of debt or equity securities are recorded in the period the costs are incurred 

contingent consideration 

we assess any contingent consideration included in the consideration paid of a business combination the value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections on revenue under various potential scenarios in which a monte carlo simulation model runs many iterations based on comparable companies revenue growth rates and their implied revenue volatilities these cash flow projections are discounted with a risk adjusted rate each quarter until such contingent amounts are earned the fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting period and adjusted as a component of operating expenses based on changes to the underlying assumptions the estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment specifically revenue growth rates implied revenue volatilities and discount rates 

• asbestos matters – prior to the petition date certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries and former companies were named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in state and federal courts we recorded a liability for our actual and anticipated future claims as well as an asset for anticipated insurance settlements we performed a detailed analysis and projected an estimated range of the total liability for pending and unasserted future asbestosrelated claims we recorded the liability at the low end of the range as we believed that no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount our key assumptions underlying the estimated asbestosrelated liabilities included the number of people occupationally exposed and likely to develop asbestosrelated diseases such as mesothelioma and lung cancer the number of people likely to file an asbestosrelated personal injury claim against us the average settlement and resolution of each claim and the percentage of claims resolved with no payment asbestosrelated defense costs were excluded from the asbestos claims liability and were recorded separately as services were incurred none of our existing or previouslyowned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos we recorded certain income and expenses associated with our asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries within discontinued operations net of tax  as they related to previously divested businesses except for amounts associated with asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries of murray and its predecessors which were recorded within continuing operations 

• revenue recognition – revenue is recognized when control of a good or service promised in a contract ie performance obligation is transferred to a customer control is obtained when a customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from that good or service a majority of our revenues are recognized at a pointintime as control is transferred at a distinct point in time per the terms of a contract however a portion of our revenues are recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives control as we perform work under a contract for these arrangements the costtocost input method is used as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs 

the transaction price allocated to performance obligations reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from a customer to determine the transaction price variable and noncash consideration are assessed as well as whether a significant financing component exists we include variable consideration in the estimated transaction price when it is probable that significant reversal of revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with variable consideration is subsequently resolved we consider historical data in determining our best estimates of variable consideration and the related accruals are recorded using the expected value method 

we enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple goods and services for these arrangements each good or service is evaluated to determine whether it represents a distinct performance obligation and whether the sales price for each obligation is representative of standalone selling price if available we utilize observable prices for goods or services sold separately to similar customers in similar circumstances to evaluate relative standalone selling price list prices are used if they are determined to be representative of standalone selling prices where necessary we ensure that the total transaction price is then allocated to the distinct performance obligations based on the determination of their relative standalone selling price at the inception of the arrangement 

we recognize revenue for delivered goods or services when the delivered good or service is distinct control of the good or service has transferred to the customer and only customary refund or return rights related to the goods or services exist for extended warranties and longterm service agreements revenue for these distinct performance obligations are recognized over time on a straightline basis over the respective contract term 

• income taxes – deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating losses and tax credits to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in our judgment to be more likely than not we regularly review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets considering our historic profitability projected future taxable income timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of our tax planning strategies where appropriate we record a valuation allowance with respect to a future tax benefit 

the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 

• employee benefit plans – we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retirees including pensions postretirement and postemployment benefits determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases mortality turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates actuarial valuations are performed to determine expense in accordance with gaap actual results may differ from the actuarial assumptions and are generally accumulated and amortized into earnings over future periods we review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends if appropriate the discount rate the rate of compensation increase and the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors 

changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the expected 2022 net periodic pension cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 42 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately 72 million a 025 rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would increase expected 2022 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by 05 million

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world 

many of our nonus operations have a functional currency other than the us dollar and their results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes therefore our reported results will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency our largest concentration of revenues from nonus operations as of december 31 2021 are in euros and chinese yuan a hypothetical 10 unfavorable change in the average exchange rate used to translate net revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 from either euros or chinese yuanbased operations into us dollars would result in a decline of approximately 135 million and 70 million respectively 

we use derivative instruments to hedge those material exposures that cannot be naturally offset the instruments utilized are viewed as risk management tools primarily involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counterparty nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2021 a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an unrealized loss of approximately 181 million as compared with 223 million at december 31 2020 these amounts when realized would be offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use commodity hedge contracts in the financial derivatives market and fixed price purchase contracts to manage this exposure commodity risks are systematically managed pursuant to policy guidelines as a cash flow hedge gains and losses resulting from the hedging instruments mitigate a portion of our exposures to changes in commodity prices the maturities of the commodity hedge contracts coincide with the expected purchase of the commodities based on the commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2021 a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 decrease in commodity prices would result in an unrealized loss of approximately 75 million these amounts when realized would be offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying commodity purchases 

interest rate exposure 

our debt portfolio mainly consists of fixedrate instruments and therefore any fluctuation in market interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations

separation of industrial segment businesses 

on february 29 2020 distribution date we completed our reverse morris trust transaction the transaction with gardner denver holdings inc gardner denver which changed its name to ingersoll rand inc after the transaction whereby we distributed ingersollrand us holdco inc which contained our former industrial segment ingersoll rand industrial through a pro rata distribution the distribution to our shareholders of record as of february 24 2020 ingersoll rand industrial then merged into a whollyowned subsidiary of gardner denver upon close of the transaction our existing shareholders received approximately 501 of the shares of gardner denver common stock on a fullydiluted basis and gardner denver stockholders retained approximately 499 of the shares of gardner denver on a fully diluted basis as a result our shareholders received 8824 shares of gardner denver common stock with respect to each share owned as of february 24 2020 in connection with the transaction ingersollrand services company an affiliate of ingersoll rand industrial borrowed an aggregate principal amount of 19 billion under a senior secured first lien term loan facility term loan the proceeds of which were used to make a special cash payment of 19 billion to a subsidiary of ours the obligations under the term loan were retained by ingersollrand services company which following the transaction is a whollyowned subsidiary of gardner denver 

in connection with the transaction we entered into several agreements covering supply administrative and tax matters to provide or obtain services on a transitional basis for varying periods after the distribution date the agreements cover services such as manufacturing information technology human resources and finance income and expenses under these agreements were not material in accordance with several customary transactionrelated agreements between us and gardner denver the parties are in a process to determine final adjustments to working capital cash and indebtedness amounts as of the distribution date as well as another process to determine funding levels related to pension plans nonqualified deferred compensation plans and retiree health benefits as of december 31 2020 both are ongoing in accordance with the transactionrelated agreements upon finalization of these agreements any adjustments will be recognized within retained earnings  

reportable segments 

prior to the separation of our industrial segment on february 29 2020 we announced a new organizational model and business segment structure designed to enhance our regional gotomarket capabilities aligning the structure with our strategy and increased focus on climate innovation under the revised structure we created three new regional operating segments from the former climate segment which also serve as our reportable segments 

• our americas segment innovates for customers in the north america and latin america regions the americas segment encompasses commercial heating and cooling systems building controls and energy services and solutions residential heating and cooling and transport refrigeration systems and solutions this segment had 2020 net revenues of 97 billion 

• our emea segment innovates for customers in the europe middle east and africa region the emea segment encompasses heating and cooling systems services and solutions for commercial buildings and transport refrigeration systems and solutions this segment had 2020 net revenues of 16 billion 

• our asia pacific segment innovates for customers throughout the asia pacific region the asia pacific segment encompasses heating and cooling systems services and solutions for commercial buildings and transport refrigeration systems and solutions this segment had 2020 net revenues of 11 billion 

this model is designed to create deep customer focus and relevance in markets around the world each segment reports through separate management teams and regularly reviews their operating results with the chief executive officer our chief operating 

table of contents 

decision maker codm determined in accordance with applicable accounting guidance all prior period comparative segment information has been recast to reflect the current reportable segments 

products and services 

our principal products and services include the following 



these products are sold primarily under our name and under our tradenames including trane ®  thermo king ® and american standard ®  

competitive conditions 

our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world due to the diversity of these products and services and the variety of markets served we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line and services they include wellestablished regional or specialized competitors as well as larger us and nonus corporations or divisions of larger companies 

the principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price quality delivery service and support technology and innovation we believe that we are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of hvac systems and services and transport temperature control products 

distribution 

our products are distributed by a number of methods which we believe are appropriate to the type of product us sales are made through branch sales offices distributors and dealers across the country nonus sales are made through numerous subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world 

table of contents 

operations by geographic area 

approximately 28 of our net revenues in 2020 were derived outside the us and we sold products in more than 100 countries therefore the attendant risks of manufacturing or selling in a particular country such as currency devaluation nationalization and establishment of common markets may have an adverse impact on our nonus operations 

customers 

we have no customer that accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues in 2020 2019 or 2018 no material part of our business is dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers therefore the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

raw materials 

we manufacture many of the components included in our products which requires us to employ a wide variety of commodities principal commodities such as steel copper and aluminum are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world primarily within the region where the products are manufactured we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future there have been no commodity shortages which have had a material adverse effect on our businesses 

seasonality 

demand for certain of our products and services is influenced by weather conditions for instance sales in our commercial and residential hvac businesses historically tend to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because this represents spring and summer in the us and other northern hemisphere markets which are the peak seasons for sales of air conditioning systems and services therefore results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unusual weather patterns or events could negatively or positively affect certain segments of our business and impact overall results of operations

we engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products enhance existing product effectiveness improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate we also continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment or acquisition in addition we have a strong focus on sustaining activities which include costs incurred to reduce production costs improve existing products create custom solutions for customers and provide support to our manufacturing facilities we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development and sustaining activities as we look to maintain and improve our competitive position 

patents and licenses 

our intellectual property rights are important to our business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets proprietary technology technical data business processes and other confidential information although in aggregate we consider our intellectual property rights to be valuable to our operations we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single intellectual property right or any group of them in our opinion engineering production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our intellectual property rights 

backlog 

our approximate backlog of orders believed to be firm at december 31 was as follows 



these backlog figures are based on orders received and only include amounts associated with our equipment and contracting and installation performance obligations a major portion of our products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock as a result we expect to ship a majority of the december 31 2020 backlog during 2021 however orders for specialized machinery or specific customer application are submitted with extensive lead times and are often subject

to revision and deferral and to a lesser extent cancellation or termination to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected 

environmental matters 

we continue to be dedicated to environmental and sustainability programs to minimize the use of natural resources and reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials from our manufacturing processes and to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the environmental protection agency and similar state authorities we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future 

for a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

asbestosrelated matters 

on june 18 2020 petition date our indirect whollyowned subsidiaries aldrich pump llc aldrich and murray boiler llc murray each filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter 11 of title 11 of the united states code the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of north carolina in charlotte the bankruptcy court as a result of the chapter 11 filings all asbestosrelated lawsuits against aldrich and murray have been stayed due to the imposition of a statutory automatic stay applicable in chapter 11 bankruptcy cases only aldrich and murray have filed for chapter 11 relief neither aldrichs whollyowned subsidiary 200 park inc 200 park murrays whollyowned subsidiary climatelabs llc climatelabs trane technologies plc nor its other subsidiaries the trane companies are part of the chapter 11 filings 

the goal of these chapter 11 filings is an efficient and permanent resolution of all current and future asbestos claims through court approval of a plan of reorganization which would establish in accordance with section 524g of the bankruptcy code a trust to pay all asbestos claims such a resolution if achieved would likely include a channeling injunction to enjoin asbestos claims resolved in the chapter 11 cases from being filed or pursued against us or our affiliates the chapter 11 cases remain pending as of december 31 2020 

prior to the petition date certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries and former companies were named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in state and federal courts in many of the lawsuits a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants the vast majority of those claims allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products primarily pumps boilers and railroad brake shoes none of our existing or previouslyowned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos

 item 1a  risk factors 

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to a number of risks that could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k the risks set forth below are those we consider most significant we face other risks however that we do not currently perceive to be material which could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from our expectations you should evaluate all risks before you invest in our securities if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted in that case the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to economic conditions 

the covid19 global pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have already adversely impacted our business and could have a more material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we continue to closely monitor the impact of the covid19 global pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies including how it has and will impact our customers team members suppliers vendors business partners and distribution channels the covid19 global pandemic has created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption which may continue to affect our business operations and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

while our business is largely categorized as “essential” by the us department of homeland security the covid19 global pandemic has caused certain disruptions to and shutdowns of our business and operations and could cause material disruptions to and shutdowns of our business and operations in the future as a result of among other things quarantines worker absenteeism as a result of illness or other factors social distancing measures and other travel healthrelated business or other restrictions our business and operations have been impacted globally resulting in lower revenue supply chain delays and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements the covid19 global pandemic has also adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our suppliers and their manufacturers and our customers some of our purchases are from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of cost effectiveness uniqueness of design or product quality the effects of the covid19 global pandemic may exacerbate supply chain issues with these suppliers any delay in receiving critical supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

as a result of the effects of the covid19 global pandemic our costs have increased including the costs to address the health and safety of our employees our ability to obtain products or services from suppliers has been and may be adversely impacted and our ability to operate at certain impacted locations has been and may be impacted and as a result our business financial condition and results of operations have been adversely impacted and could be materially adversely affected if the current outbreak and spread of the covid19 global pandemic continues 

the covid19 global pandemic also resulted in severe disruptions and volatility in financial markets which had a material adverse impact on some of our customers and suppliers a recurrence in volatility due to a resurgence in the covid19 global pandemic could impact our access to capital and credit markets notwithstanding the recent introduction of vaccines to combat the covid19 global pandemic and measures taken by governments to provide economic stimulus the severity of the pandemic’s impact on economies in the united states and around the world the potential length of the economic recovery and the longer term economic impacts are uncertain the current and potential further outbreaks and spread of the covid19 global pandemic or other future pandemics could cause a delayed recovery a prolonged recession or future economic disruptions which could have a further adverse impact on our financial condition and operations 

the impact of the covid19 global pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in item 1a risk factors in our annual report on form 10k any of which could have a material effect on us this situation is continuing to evolve rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally these activities are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

• changes in local laws and regulations or imposition of currency restrictions and other restraints 

• limitation of ownership rights including expropriation of assets by a local government and limitation on the ability to repatriate earnings 

• sovereign debt crises and currency instability in developed and developing countries 

• trade protection measures such as import or export restrictions and requirements the imposition of burdensome tariffs and quotas or revocation or material modification of trade agreements 

table of contents 

• difficulty in staffing and managing global operations 

• difficulty of enforcing agreements collecting receivables and protecting assets through nonus legal systems 

• national and international conflict including war civil disturbances and terrorist acts and 

• recessions economic downturns slowing economic growth and social and political instability 

these risks could increase our cost of doing business internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations limit our ability to sell products in certain markets and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we face significant competition in the markets that we serve 

the markets that we serve are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products there has been consolidation and new entrants including nontraditional competitors within our industries and there may be future consolidation and new entrants which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the competitive landscape in which we operate due to our global footprint we are competing worldwide with large companies and with smaller local operators who may have customer regulatory or economic advantages in the geographies in which they are located in addition some of our competitors may employ pricing and other strategies that are not traditional while we understand our markets and competitive landscape there is always the risk of disruptive technologies coming from companies that are not traditionally manufacturers or service providers of our products 

our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

we must develop and commercialize new products and services in a rapidly changing technological and business environment in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business the development and commercialization of new products and services require a significant investment of resources and an anticipation of the impact of new technologies and the ability to compete with others who may have superior resources in specific technology domains we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by our current and future markets failure to develop new products and services that are accepted by these markets could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

some of the markets in which we operate are cyclical and seasonal and demand for our products and services could be adversely affected by downturns in these industries 

demand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers the level of capital expenditures by our customers fluctuates based on planned expansions new builds repairs commodity prices general economic conditions availability of credit inflation interest rates market forecasts tax and regulatory developments trade policies fiscal spending and sociopolitcal factors among others 

our commercial and residential hvac businesses provide products and services to a wide range of markets including significant sales to the commercial and residential construction markets weakness in either or both of these construction markets may negatively impact the demand for our products and services 

demand for our commercial and residential hvac business is also influenced by weather conditions for instance sales in our commercial and residential hvac businesses historically tend to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because in the us and other northern hemisphere markets spring and summer are the peak seasons for sales of air conditioning systems and services the results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unusual weather patterns or events could negatively or positively affect our business and impact overall results of operations 

decrease in the demand for our products and services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 

table of contents 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and long term credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategies 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit at interest rates and on terms that are acceptable to them could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

in addition changes in regulatory standards or industry practices such as the transition away from libor as a benchmark for shortterm interest rates could create incremental uncertainty in obtaining financing or increase the cost of borrowing for us our suppliers or our customers 

currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world 

many of our nonus operations have a functional currency other than the us dollar and their results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes therefore our reported results will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 

we use derivative instruments to hedge those material exposures that cannot be naturally offset the instruments utilized are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

risks related to litigation 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business or the business operations of previouslyowned entities our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation contract claims or other commercial disputes product liability product defects and asbestosrelated matters that cannot be predicted with certainty moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against the total aggregate amount of losses sustained as a result of such proceedings and contingencies as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other events could affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the aldrich and murray chapter 11 cases involve various risks and uncertainties that could have a material effect on us 

on june 18 2020 our indirect whollyowned subsidiaries aldrich pump llc aldrich and murray boiler llc murray each filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter 11 of title 11 the united states code the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of north carolina in charlotte the bankruptcy court the goal of these chapter 11 filings is an efficient and permanent resolution of all current and future asbestos claims through court approval of a plan of reorganization which would establish in accordance with section 524g of the bankruptcy code a trust to pay all asbestos claims such a resolution if achieved would likely include a channeling injunction to enjoin asbestos claims resolved in the chapter 11 cases from being filed or pursued against us or our affiliates the chapter 11 cases remain pending 

table of contents 

certain of our subsidiaries have entered into funding agreements with aldrich and murray collectively the funding agreements pursuant to which those subsidiaries are obligated among other things to fund the costs and expenses of aldrich and murray during the pendency of the chapter 11 cases to the extent distributions from their respective subsidiaries are insufficient to do so and to provide an amount for the funding for a trust established pursuant to section 524g of the bankruptcy code to the extent that the other assets of aldrich and murray are insufficient to provide the requisite trust funding 

there are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with these chapter 11 cases including among others those related to 

• the ultimate determination of the asbestos liability of aldrich and murray to be satisfied under a chapter 11 plan 

• the outcome of negotiations with the committee of asbestos personal injury claimants appointed in the chapter 11 cases the future claimants representative appointed in the chapter 11 cases and other participants in the chapter 11 cases including insurers concerning among other things the size and structure of a potential section 524g trust to pay the asbestos liability of aldrich and murray and the means for funding that trust 

• the actions of representatives of the asbestos claimants including opposition to the extension of the bankruptcy court order temporarily staying asbestosrelated claims against us and other potential actions in opposition to or otherwise inconsistent with the efforts by aldrich and murray to diligently prosecute the chapter 11 cases and ultimately seek bankruptcy court approval of a plan of reorganization 

• the decisions of the bankruptcy court relating to numerous substantive and procedural aspects of the chapter 11 case including with regard to the extension of the bankruptcy court order temporarily staying asbestosrelated claims against us and other efforts by aldrich and murray to diligently prosecute the chapter 11 cases and ultimately seek bankruptcy court approval of a plan of reorganization whether such decisions are in response to actions of representatives of the asbestos claimants or otherwise and 

• the decisions of appellate courts regarding approval of a plan of reorganization or relating to orders of the bankruptcy court that may be appealed 

the ability of aldrich and murray to successfully reorganize and resolve their asbestos liabilities will depend on various factors including their ability to reach agreements with representatives of the asbestos claimants on the terms of a plan of reorganization that satisfies all applicable legal requirements and to obtain the requisite court approvals of such plan and remains subject to the risks and uncertainties described above we cannot ensure that aldrich and murray can successfully reorganize nor can we give any assurances as to the amount of the ultimate obligations under the funding agreements or the resulting impact on our financial condition results of operations or future prospects we are also unable to predict the timing of any of the foregoing matters or the timing for a resolution of the chapter 11 cases all of which could have an impact on us 

it also is possible that in the chapter 11 cases various parties will seek to bring claims against us and other related parties including by raising allegations that we are liable for the asbestosrelated liabilities of aldrich and murray although we believe we have no such responsibility for liabilities of aldrich and murray except indirectly through our obligation to provide funding to aldrich and murray under the terms of the funding agreements we cannot provide assurances that such claims will not be pursued 

in sum the outcome of the chapter 11 cases is uncertain and there is uncertainty as to what extent we may have to contribute to a section 524g trust under the funding agreements 

risks related to cybersecurity and technology 

we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are supported by third party vendors including cloud services to manage and operate our business we invest in new information technology systems designed to improve our operations we have had failures of these systems in the past and may have failures of these systems in the future if these systems cease to function properly if these systems experience security breaches or disruptions or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

security breaches or disruptions of the technology systems infrastructure or products of the company or our vendors could negatively impact our business and financial results 

our information technology systems networks and infrastructure and technology embedded in certain of our control products have been and may be subject to cyber attacks and unauthorized security intrusions it is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period like other large companies certain of our information technology systems and the systems of our vendors have been subject to computer viruses malicious code unauthorized access phishing attempts denialofservice attacks and other cyber attacks and we expect that we and our vendors will be subject to similar attacks in the future 

table of contents 

the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage information technology systems are constantly changing and evolving despite having instituted security policies and business continuity plans and implementing and regularly reviewing and updating processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access and requiring similar protections from our vendors the everevolving threats mean we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes and ask our vendors to do the same and there is no guarantee that such steps will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data hardware software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or deployment or other problems that could unexpectedly result in security breaches or disruptions our systems networks and certain of our control products and those of our vendors may also be vulnerable to system damage malicious attacks from hackers employee errors or misconduct viruses power and utility outages and other catastrophic events any of these incidents could cause significant harm to our business by negatively impacting our business operations compromising the security of our proprietary information or the personally identifiable information of our customers employees and business partners exposing us to litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties fines fees or liabilities such events could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could damage our reputation which could adversely affect our business our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to a cybersecurity attack or disruptions resulting from such attacks customers are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands 

data privacy and protection laws are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges 

the regulatory environment surrounding data privacy and protection is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses and geographic areas we are required to comply with complex regulations when collecting transferring and using personal data which increases our costs affects our competitiveness and can expose us to substantial fines or other penalties 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our competitive position 

our intellectual property rights are important to our business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets proprietary technology technical data business processes and other confidential information although in aggregate we consider our intellectual property rights to be valuable to our operations we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single intellectual property right or any group of them in our opinion engineering production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our patents andor licenses 

nonetheless this intellectual property may be subject to challenge infringement invalidation or circumvention by third parties despite extensive security measures our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems employee theft or theft by private parties or foreign actors including those affiliated with or controlled by state actors our business and competitive position could be harmed by such events our ability to protect our intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are inadequate or undeveloped our inability to enforce our ip rights under any of these circumstances could have an impact on our competitive position and business 

risks related to regulatory matters 

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption antibribery export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any violations of law or improper conduct could damage our reputation and depending on the circumstances subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects financial condition results of operations cash flows and the market value of our stock 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including among others laws related to the environment and health and safety we have made and will be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations any violations of applicable laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties fines or other sanctions changes in current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to 

table of contents

global climate change and related regulations could negatively affect our business 

refrigerants are essential to many of our products and there is concern regarding the global warming potential of such materials as such national regional and international regulations and policies are being implemented to curtail their use as regulations reduce the use of the current class of widely used refrigerants our next generation solutions are being adopted globally with sales in more than 30 countries to date our climate commitment requires us to offer a full line of next generation lower global warming potential products by 2030 without compromising safety or energy efficiency additionally while we met our commitment to reduce energy consumption and the greenhouse gas footprint of our operations by 35 percent by 2020 on a normalized basis our 2030 commitment requires a much more stringent absolute energy use reduction by 10 percent while we are committed to pursuing these sustainability objectives there can be no assurance that our commitments will be successful that our products will be accepted by the market that proposed regulation or deregulation will not have a negative competitive impact or that economic returns will match the investment that we are making in new product development 

concerns regarding global climate change have resulted in the kigali amendment to the montreal protocol pursuant to which countries have agreed to a scheduled phase down of certain high global warming potential refrigerants countries may pass regulations that are even more restrictive than this international accord some countries including the us have not yet ratified the amendment lowering customer demand for next generation products in these countries there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty such regulatory uncertainty extends to future incentives for energy efficient buildings and vehicles and costs of compliance which may impact the demand for our products obsolescence of our products and our results of operations 

risks related to our business operations 

commodity shortages and price increases could adversely affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities particularly steel and nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in the prices of these commodities or the impact of inflationary increases could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows conversely in the event there is deflation we may experience pressure from our customers to reduce prices there can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows while we may use financial derivatives or supplier price locks to hedge against this volatility by using these instruments we may potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in prices and could experience lower margins in periods of declining commodity prices in addition while hedging activity may minimize nearterm volatility of the commodity prices it would not protect us from longterm commodity price increases 

some of our purchases are from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of cost effectiveness uniqueness of design or product quality if these suppliers encounter financial or operating difficulties we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply 

our business strategy includes acquiring companies businesses product lines plants and assets entering into joint ventures and making investments that complement our existing businesses we also occasionally divest businesses that we own we may not identify acquisition or joint venture candidates or investment opportunities at the same rate as the past acquisitions dispositions joint ventures and investments that we identify could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents 

we continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition and divestiture of strategic businesses and product lines technologies and capabilities plants and assets joint ventures and investments with the potential to strengthen our industry position to enhance our existing set of product and services offerings to increase productivity and efficiencies to grow revenues earnings and cash flow to help us stay competitive or to reduce costs there can be no assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable candidates in the future that we will consummate these transactions at rates similar to the past or that completed transactions will be successful strategic transactions may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows such transactions involve numerous other risks including 

• diversion of management time and attention from daily operations 

• difficulties integrating acquired businesses technologies and personnel into our business without high costs 

• difficulties in obtaining and verifying the financial statements and other business and other due diligence information of acquired businesses 

• inability to obtain required regulatory approvals andor required financing on favorable terms 

• potential loss of key employees key contractual relationships or key customers of either acquired businesses or our business 

• assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen or undisclosed liabilities of acquired businesses and exposure to regulatory sanctions 

• inheriting internal control deficiencies 

• dilution of interests of holders of our common shares through the issuance of equity securities or equitylinked securities and 

• in the case of joint ventures and other investments interests that diverge from those of our partners without the ability to direct the management and operations of the joint venture or investment in the manner we believe most appropriate to achieve the expected value 

any acquisitions divestitures joint ventures or investments may ultimately harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows there are additional risks related to our reverse morris trust transaction see page 15 under risks related to the transactions for more information 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

at december 31 2020 the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 53 billion and 26 billion respectively in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we assess these assets annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of an asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the asset significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and sustained market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairments to goodwill or other indefinitelived assets any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the periods recognized 

natural disasters epidemics or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and may not be fully covered by insurance 

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including hurricanes fires earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks or other unexpected events in the us or in other countries in which we operate or are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters power outages health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our plants temporary or longterm disruption of our operations by causing business interruptions or by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing existing insurance arrangements may not provide full protection for the costs that may arise from such events particularly if such events are catastrophic in nature or occur in combination the occurrence of any of these events could increase our insurance and other operating costs or harm our sales in affected areas 

our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force 

certain of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils we experience from time to time work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force and some of these events 

table of contents 

could result in significant increases in our cost of labor impact our productivity or damage our reputation additionally a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available stoppages by employees of our customers could also result in reduced demand for our products 

risks relating to tax matters 

changes in tax or other laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under us or nonus laws or adverse determinations by taxing or other governmental authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our operations and corporate structure could be impacted by changes in tax or other laws treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the us or nonus tax or other governmental authorities enacted comprehensive tax reform legislation in december 2017 known as the tax cuts and jobs act the act made broad and complex changes to the us tax code as part of the migration from a worldwide system of taxation to a modified territorial system for corporations the act imposed a transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of nonus subsidiaries and an additional annual us tax on the earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries the act also imposed new and substantial limitations on andor the elimination of certain tax deductions including interest and credits including foreign tax credits that could adversely impact our effective tax rate or operating cash flows 

notwithstanding this change in us tax law we continue to monitor for other tax changes us and nonus related which can also adversely impact our overall tax burden from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws regulations or interpretations thereof of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted or implemented could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations moreover the organisation for economic cooperation and development has released proposals to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting including pillar one and pillar two such that tax laws in countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely impact us finally the european commission has been very active in investigating whether various tax regimes or private tax rulings provided by a country to particular taxpayers may constitute state aid we cannot predict the outcome of any of these potential changes or investigations in any of the jurisdictions but if any of the above occurs and impacts us this could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

while we monitor proposals and other developments that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals or regulatory changes are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax or other laws is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding the shareholders decision to reorganize in ireland limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

in addition tax authorities periodically review tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate these examinations on their own or any subsequent litigation related to the examinations may result in additional taxes or penalties against us if the ultimate result of these audits differ from our original or adjusted estimates they could have a material impact on our tax provision 

risks related to our reverse morris trust transaction 

on february 29 2020 the distribution date we completed our reverse morris trust transaction the transaction with gardner denver holdings inc gardner denver which changed its name to ingersoll rand inc after the transaction whereby we distributed ingersollrand us holdco inc which contained our former industrial segment ingersoll rand industrial through a pro rata distribution the distribution to our shareholders of record as of february 24 2020 ingersoll rand industrial then merged with a whollyowned subsidiary of gardner denver upon close of the transaction our existing shareholders received approximately 501 of the shares of gardner denver common stock on a fullydiluted basis and gardner denver stockholders retained approximately 499 of the shares of gardner denver on a fully diluted basis as a result our shareholders received 08824 shares of gardner denver common stock with respect to each share of our stock owned as of february 24 2020 in connection with the transaction ingersollrand services company an affiliate of ingersoll rand industrial borrowed an aggregate principal amount of 19 billion under a senior secured first lien term loan facility the term loan the proceeds of which were transferred to one of our whollyowned subsidiaries the obligations under the term loan were retained by ingersollrand services company which following the transaction is a whollyowned subsidiary of ingersoll

if the distribution is determined to be taxable for irish tax purposes significant irish tax liabilities may arise for our shareholders 

we received an opinion from irish revenue regarding certain tax matters associated with the distribution as well as a legal opinion from our irish counsel arthur cox regarding certain irish tax consequences for shareholders of the distribution for our shareholders that are not resident or ordinarily resident in ireland for irish tax purposes and that do not hold their shares in connection with a trade or business carried on by such shareholders through an irish branch or agency we consider based on both opinions taken together that no adverse irish tax consequences for such shareholders should have arisen these opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations notwithstanding the opinion from irish revenue irish revenue could ultimately determine on audit that the distribution is taxable for irish tax purposes for example if it determines that any of these facts assumptions or representations are not correct or have been violated a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment and is not binding on irish revenue or the courts and irish revenue or the courts may not agree with the legal opinion in addition the legal opinion is based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable for irish tax purposes certain of our shareholders and we could have significant irish tax liabilities as a result of the distribution and there could be a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions do not qualify as taxfree under sections 355 and 368a of the code including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of the company or ingersoll rand inc then the company and our shareholders may be required to pay substantial us federal income taxes and ingersoll rand inc may be obligated to indemnify the company for such taxes imposed on the company 

we received an opinion from our us tax counsel paul weiss rifkind wharton  garrison llp paul weiss substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the distribution together with certain related transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution and taking into account the merger of ingersoll rand industrial with the whollyowned subsidiary of gardner denver will qualify as a taxfree transaction under sections 368a 361 and 355 of the code with the result that we and our shareholders will not recognize any gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff the opinion of our counsel was based on among other things certain representations and assumptions as to factual matters made by gardner denver ingersoll rand industrial and the company the failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true correct and complete in all material respects could adversely affect the validity of the opinion of counsel an opinion of counsel represents counsel’s best legal judgment is not binding on the internal revenue service irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinion will be based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution andor related internal transactions in anticipation of the distribution ultimately are determined to be taxable we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities which could cause a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods although if this determination resulted from certain actions taken by ingersoll rand industrial or ingersoll rand inc ingersoll rand inc would be required to bear the cost of any resultant tax liability pursuant to the terms of the tax matters agreement 

the distribution will be taxable to the company pursuant to section 355e of the code if there is a 50 or greater change in ownership of either the company or ingersoll rand industrial directly or indirectly including through such a change in ownership of ingersoll rand inc as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution a section 355e change of ownership would not make the distribution taxable to our shareholders but instead may result in corporatelevel taxable gain to certain of our subsidiaries because our shareholders will collectively be treated as owning more than 50 of the ingersoll rand inc common stock following the merger the merger alone should not cause the distribution to be taxable to our subsidiaries under section 355e however section 355e might apply if other acquisitions of stock of the company before or after the merger or of ingersoll rand inc before or after the merger are considered to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution together with certain related transactions if section 355e applied certain of our subsidiaries might recognize a very substantial amount of taxable gain although if this applied as a result of certain actions taken by ingersoll rand industrial ingersoll rand inc or certain specified ingersoll rand inc stockholders ingersoll rand inc would be required to bear the cost of any resultant tax liability under section 355e pursuant to the terms of the tax matters agreement

risks related to our irish domicile 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions indemnification of directors and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states in addition irish law does not allow for any form of legal proceedings directly equivalent to the class action available in the united states 

irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemptive rights with respect to any particular allotment of shares under irish law we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares including shares that are part of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital in addition unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders when an irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a prorata basis if we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations our ability to issue shares or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 25 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders resident in the united states will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could have an adverse impact on the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of our shares will generally not be subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in trane technologies plc 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in trane technologies plc

separation of industrial segment business 

on february 29 2020 distribution date we completed our reverse morris trust transaction the transaction with gardner denver holdings inc gardner denver which changed its name to ingersoll rand inc after the transaction whereby we distributed ingersollrand us holdco inc which contained our former industrial segment ingersoll rand industrial through a pro rata distribution the distribution to our shareholders of record as of february 24 2020 ingersoll rand industrial then merged into a whollyowned subsidiary of gardner denver upon close of the transaction our existing shareholders received approximately 501 of the shares of gardner denver common stock on a fullydiluted basis and gardner denver stockholders retained approximately 499 of the shares of gardner denver on a fully diluted basis as a result our shareholders received 8824 shares of gardner denver common stock with respect to each share owned as of february 24 2020 in connection with the transaction ingersollrand services company an affiliate of ingersoll rand industrial borrowed an aggregate principal amount of 19 billion under a senior secured first lien term loan facility term loan the proceeds of which were used to make a special cash payment of 19 billion to a subsidiary of ours the obligations under the term loan were retained by ingersollrand services company which following the transaction is a whollyowned subsidiary of gardner denver

significant events 

covid19 global pandemic 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a respiratory disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus known now as covid19 as a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide beginning in the first quarter of 2020 many countries responded by implementing measures to combat the outbreak which impacted global business operations and resulted in our decision to temporarily close or limit our workforce to essential crews within many facilities throughout the world in order to ensure employee safety in addition our nonessential employees were instructed to work from home in compliance with global government stayinplace protocols 

we have been adversely impacted by the covid19 global pandemic temporary facility closures beginning in the first quarter of 2020 disrupted results in the asia pacific region with impacts more widely felt throughout operations in the americas and emea in the months thereafter during the second quarter of 2020 we began to reopen facilities while maintaining appropriate health and safety precautions however the challenges in connection with the pandemic continued as we experienced lower volume which negatively impacted revenue and certain supply chain delays in response we proactively initiated cost cutting actions in an effort to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our business this included reducing discretionary spending restricting travel delaying meritbased salary increases and implementing employee furloughs in certain markets 

we continue to navigate the new realities brought about by the covid19 global pandemic as well as any impact on our liquidity needs and ability to access capital markets despite these challenges all production facilities remain open and we continue to sell install and service our products during the second half of 2020 we did not experience any major delays in our supply chain and continued to focus on health and safety precautions to protect our employees and customers in addition during the fourth quarter of 2020 we completed several restorative actions including the reinstatement of annual meritbased salary increases and resuming all aspects of our balanced capital allocation strategy which included acquisitions and share repurchases operationally our financial reporting systems internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures continue to operate effectively despite a remote workforce of nonessential frontline employees we will continue to monitor the ongoing situation as it evolves globally and will assess any potential impacts to our business and financial position 

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgments in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingencies because they may arise from matters that are inherently uncertain the financial statements reflect our best estimates as of december 31 2020 including as it relates to the actual and potential future impacts of the covid19 global pandemic with respect to the recoverability of our assets including our receivables and longlived assets such as goodwill and intangibles however due to significant uncertainty surrounding the covid19 global pandemic managements judgment regarding this could change in the future in addition while our results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be negatively impacted the extent of the impact cannot be estimated with certainty at this time 

as part of the response to covid19 global pandemic many countries implemented emergency economic relief plans as a way of minimizing the economic impact of this health crisis we are evaluating the potential benefits from certain of these measures and will continue to monitor the plans as they are finalized and implemented in the united states the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act was enacted on march 27 2020 providing numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures we are currently applying the cares act to our operations which includes the deferral of employer social security payroll tax payments under the cares act through january 1 2021 with 50 percent owed on december 31 2021 and the other half owed on december 31 2022

the 2019 effective tax rate was 171 which is lower than the us statutory rate of 21 primarily due to a reduction in deferred tax asset valuation allowances for certain nonus net deferred tax assets and excess tax benefits from employee sharebased payments these amounts were partially offset by us state and local taxes an increase in a deferred tax asset valuation allowance for certain state net deferred tax assets and certain nondeductible expenses in addition the reduction was

certain of our subsidiaries entered into funding agreements with aldrich and murray pursuant to which those subsidiaries are obligated among other things to pay the costs and expenses of aldrich and murray during the pendency of the chapter 11 cases to the extent distributions from their respective subsidiaries are insufficient to do so and to provide an amount for the funding for a trust established pursuant to section 524g of the bankruptcy code to the extent that the other assets of aldrich and murray are insufficient to provide the requisite trust funding 

as the covid19 global pandemic impacts both the broader economy and our operations we will continue to assess our liquidity needs and our ability to access capital markets a continued worldwide disruption could materially affect economies and financial markets worldwide resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms and otherwise adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations the covid19 global pandemic created substantial volatility in the shortterm credit markets during the first half of 2020 a recurrence in volatility due to a resurgence in the covid19 global pandemic could impact the cost of our credit facilities the cost of any borrowing we might make under those facilities or the cost of any commercial paper we may issue to the extent we were to either draw on our facilities or issue commercial paper see part i item 1a risk factors for more information

our public debt does not contain financial covenants and our revolving credit lines have a debttototal capital covenant of 65 as of december 31 2020 our debttototal capital ratio was significantly beneath this limit 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment period 



a includes 3430 million of debt redeemable at the option of the holder the scheduled maturities of these bonds range between 2027 and 2028 

table of contents 

future expected obligations under the funding agreement and our pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes environmental and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above 

pensions 

at december 31 2020 we had a net unfunded liability of 5482 million which consists of noncurrent pension assets of 728 million and current and noncurrent pension benefit liabilities of 6210 million it is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required we currently expect that we will contribute approximately 56 million to our enterprise plans worldwide in 2021 the timing and amounts of future contributions are dependent upon the funding status of the plan which is expected to vary as a result of changes in interest rates returns on underlying assets and other factors therefore pension contributions have been excluded from the preceding table see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding pensions 

postretirement benefits other than pensions 

at december 31 2020 we had postretirement benefit obligations of 3891 million we fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a payasyougo basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations benefit payments which are net of expected plan participant contributions and medicare part d subsidy are expected to be approximately 37 million in 2021 because benefit payments are not required to be funded in advance and the timing and amounts of future payments are dependent on the cost of benefits for retirees covered by the plan they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding postretirement benefits other than pensions 

income taxes 

at december 31 2020 we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of 654 million and 146 million of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax the liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits 

contingent liabilities 

we are involved in various litigation claims and administrative proceedings including those related to the funding agreements and environmental and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding contingent liabilities 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from these estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

• goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets – we have significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions these assets are tested and reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of an asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the asset in addition an interim impairment test is completed upon a triggering event or when there is a reorganization of reporting structure or disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit 

the determination of estimated fair value requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows including profit margins longterm forecasts discount rates and terminal growth rates we developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

table of contents 

annual goodwill impairment test 

impairment of goodwill is assessed at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard codification asc 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other asc 350 for those reporting units that bypass or fail the qualitative assessment the test compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair value is determined using three valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model an income approach a marketadjusted multiple of earnings and revenues a market approach and a similar transactions method also a market approach the discounted cash flow approach relies on our estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing growth and margins with due consideration given to forecasting risk the multiple of earnings and revenues approach reflects the markets expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publicly traded companies and the subject reporting units the similar transactions method considers prices paid in transactions that have recently occurred in our industry or in related industries these valuation techniques are weighted 50 40 and 10 respectively 

interim goodwill impairment test 

during the first quarter of 2020 we announced a new organizational model and business segment structure under the revised structure we created three new regional operating segments which also serve as our reportable segments previously reported under our former climate segment in connection with the new segment structure we performed an interim goodwill impairment assessment immediately prior to the reorganization becoming effective the results of which did not indicate any goodwill impairment we then reassigned our goodwill among the newly designated reporting units using a relative fair value approach and immediately performed a second goodwill impairment assessment under the new reporting structure the results did not indicate any goodwill impairment we relied on the guideline public company method specifically a marketadjusted multiple of earnings and revenues approach to calculate the fair value of the new reporting units 

other indefinitelived intangible assets 

impairment of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is first assessed using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired this assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset for those indefinitelived assets where it is required a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology income approach which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value would be recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess 

• asbestos matters – prior to the petition date certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries and former companies were named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in state and federal courts we recorded a liability for our actual and anticipated future claims as well as an asset for anticipated insurance settlements we performed a detailed analysis and projected an estimated range of the total liability for pending and unasserted future asbestosrelated claims in accordance with asc 450 contingencies asc 450 we recorded the liability at the low end of the range as we believed that no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount our key assumptions underlying the estimated asbestosrelated liabilities included the number of people occupationally exposed and likely to develop asbestosrelated diseases such as mesothelioma and lung cancer the number of people likely to file an asbestosrelated personal injury claim against us the average settlement and resolution of each claim and the percentage of claims resolved with no payment asbestosrelated defense costs were excluded from the asbestos claims liability and were recorded separately as services were incurred none of our existing or previouslyowned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos we recorded certain income and expenses associated with our asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries within discontinued operations net of tax  as they related to previously divested businesses except for amounts associated with asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries of murray and its predecessors which were recorded within continuing operations

• revenue recognition – revenue is recognized when control of a good or service promised in a contract ie performance obligation is transferred to a customer control is obtained when a customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from that good or service a majority of our revenues are recognized at a pointintime as control is transferred at a distinct point in time per the terms of a contract however a portion of our revenues are recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives control as we perform work under a contract for these arrangements the costtocost input method is used as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incurs costs we adopted accounting standard update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 on january 1 2018 using the modified retrospective approach refer to note 3 summary of significant accounting policies and note 13 revenue for additional information related to the adoption of asc 606 

the transaction price allocated to performance obligations reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from a customer to determine the transaction price variable and noncash consideration are assessed as well as whether a significant financing component exists we include variable consideration in the estimated transaction price when it is probable that significant reversal of revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with variable consideration is subsequently resolved we consider historical data in determining our best estimates of variable consideration and the related accruals are recorded using the expected value method 

we enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple goods and services such as equipment installation and extended warranties for these arrangements each good or service is evaluated to determine whether it represents a distinct performance obligation and whether the sales price for each obligation is representative of standalone selling price if available we utilize observable prices for goods or services sold separately to similar customers in similar circumstances to evaluate relative standalone selling price list prices are used if they are determined to be representative of standalone selling prices where necessary we ensure that the total transaction price is then allocated to the distinct performance obligations based on the determination of their relative standalone selling price at the inception of the arrangement 

we recognize revenue for delivered goods or services when the delivered good or service is distinct control of the good or service has transferred to the customer and only customary refund or return rights related to the goods or services exist for extended warranties and longterm service agreements revenue for these distinct performance obligations are recognized over time on a straightline basis over the respective contract term 

• income taxes – deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating losses and tax credits to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in our judgment to be more likely than not we regularly review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets considering our historic profitability projected future taxable income timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of our tax planning strategies where appropriate we record a valuation allowance with respect to a future tax benefit 

the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 

• employee benefit plans – we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retirees including pensions postretirement and postemployment benefits determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases mortality turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates actuarial valuations are performed to determine expense in accordance with gaap actual results may differ from the actuarial assumptions and are generally accumulated and amortized into earnings over future periods we review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends if appropriate the discount rate the rate of compensation increase and the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors 

changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the expected 2021 net periodic pension cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic 

table of contents 

assumptions are as follows the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 48 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately 76 million a 025 rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would increase expected 2021 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by 05 million

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world 

many of our nonus operations have a functional currency other than the us dollar and their results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes therefore our reported results will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency our largest concentration of revenues from nonus operations as of december 31 2020 are in euros and chinese yuan a hypothetical 10 unfavorable change in the average exchange rate used to translate net revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 from either euros or chinese yuanbased operations into us dollars would not have a material impact on our financial statements 

we use derivative instruments to hedge those material exposures that cannot be naturally offset the instruments utilized are viewed as risk management tools primarily involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2020 a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an unrealized loss of approximately 223 million as compared with 278 million at december 31 2019 these amounts when realized would be offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2020 

interest rate exposure 

our debt portfolio mainly consists of fixedrate instruments and therefore any fluctuation in market interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations

acquisitions and equity investments 

during 2019 we acquired several businesses that complement existing products and services in may 2019 we acquired 100 of the outstanding stock of precision flow systems pfs pfs reported in the industrial segment is a manufacturer of precision flow control equipment including precision dosing pumps and controls that serve the global water oil and gas agriculture industrial and specialty market segments acquisitions within the climate segment consisted of an independent dealer to support the ongoing strategy to expand our distribution network as well as other businesses that strengthen our product portfolio

during 2017 we acquired several businesses including channel acquisitions that complement existing products and services acquisitions within the climate segment primarily consisted of independent dealers which support the ongoing strategy to expand our distribution network acquisitions within the industrial segment primarily consisted of a telematics business which builds upon our growing portfolio of connected assets 

competitive conditions 

our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world due to the diversity of these products and services and the variety of markets served we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line and services they include wellestablished regional or specialized competitors as well as larger us and nonus corporations or divisions of larger companies 

the principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price quality delivery service and support technology and innovation we believe that we are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of hvac systems and services air compression systems transport temperature control products power tools and golf utility and consumer lowspeed vehicles 

distribution 

our products are distributed by a number of methods which we believe are appropriate to the type of product us sales are made through branch sales offices distributors and dealers across the country nonus sales are made through numerous subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world 

operations by geographic area 

approximately 34 of our net revenues in 2019 were derived outside the us and we sold products in more than 100 countries therefore the attendant risks of manufacturing or selling in a particular country such as currency devaluation nationalization and establishment of common markets may have an adverse impact on our nonus operations 

customers 

we have no customer that accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues in 2019  2018 or 2017  no material part of our business is dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers therefore the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

raw materials 

we manufacture many of the components included in our products which requires us to employ a wide variety of commodities principal commodities such as steel copper and aluminum are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world primarily within the region where the products are manufactured we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future there have been no commodity shortages which have had a material adverse effect on our businesses 

working capital 

we manufacture products that must be readily available to meet our customers’ rapid delivery requirements therefore we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs and our customers’ requirements such working capital requirements are not however in the opinion of management materially different from those experienced by our major competitors we believe our sales and payment terms are competitive in and appropriate for the markets in which we compete 

seasonality 

demand for certain of our products and services is influenced by weather conditions for instance sales in our commercial and residential hvac businesses historically tend to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because this represents spring and summer in the us and other northern hemisphere markets which are the peak seasons for sales of air conditioning systems and services therefore results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unusual weather patterns or events could negatively or positively affect certain segments of our business and impact overall results of operations 

research and development 

we engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products enhance existing product effectiveness improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate in addition we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment or acquisition we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development activities as we look to maintain and improve our competitive position 

patents and licenses 

our intellectual property rights are important to our business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets proprietary technology technical data business processes and other confidential information although in aggregate we consider our intellectual property rights to be valuable to our operations we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single intellectual property right or any group of them in our opinion engineering production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our patents andor licenses 

backlog 

our approximate backlog of orders believed to be firm at december 31  was as follows 



these backlog figures are based on orders received while the major portion of our products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock orders for specialized machinery or specific customer application are submitted with extensive lead times and are often subject to revision and deferral and to a lesser extent cancellation or termination we expect to ship a majority of the december 31 2019 backlog during 2020  

environmental matters 

we continue to be dedicated to environmental and sustainability programs to minimize the use of natural resources and reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials from our manufacturing processes and to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the environmental protection agency and similar state authorities we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future 

for a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

asbestosrelated matters 

certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries and former companies are named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in state and federal courts in many of the lawsuits a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants the vast majority of those claims allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products primarily pumps boilers and railroad brake shoes none of our existing or previouslyowned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos

no family relationship exists between any of the abovelisted executive officers of the company all officers are elected to hold office for one year or until their successors are elected and qualified 




 item 1a  risk factors 

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to a number of risks that could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k the risks set forth below are those we consider most significant we face other risks however that we do not currently perceive to be material which could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from our expectations you should evaluate all risks before you invest in our securities if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted in that case the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally these activities are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

 these risks could increase our cost of doing business internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations limit our ability to sell products in certain markets and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we face significant competition in the markets that we serve and our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

the markets that we serve are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products there has been consolidation and new entrants including nontraditional competitors within our industries and there may be future consolidation and new entrants which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the competitive landscape in which we operate due to our global footprint we are competing worldwide with large companies and with smaller local operators who may have customer regulatory or economic advantages in the geographies in which they are located in addition some of our competitors may employ pricing and other strategies that are not traditional while we understand our markets and competitive landscape there is always the risk of disruptive technologies coming from companies that are not traditionally manufacturers or service providers of our products 

in addition we must develop and commercialize new products and services in a rapidly changing technological and business environment in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business the development and commercialization of new products and services require a significant investment of resources and an anticipation of the impact of new technologies and the ability to compete with others who may have superior resources in specific technology domains we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by our current and future markets failure to develop new products and services that are accepted by these markets could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and long term credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategies 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit at interest rates and on terms that are acceptable to them could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

in addition changes in regulatory standards or industry practices such as the transition away from libor as a benchmark for shortterm interest rates could create incremental uncertainty in obtaining financing or increase the cost of borrowing for us our suppliers or our customers 

currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world 

many of our nonus operations have a functional currency other than the us dollar and their results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes therefore our reported results will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 

we use derivative instruments to hedge those material exposures that cannot be naturally offset the instruments utilized are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business or the business operations of previouslyowned entities our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation contract claims or other commercial disputes product liability product defects and asbestosrelated matters that cannot be predicted with certainty moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against the total aggregate amount of losses sustained as a result of such proceedings and contingencies as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other events could affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption antibribery export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any violations of law or improper conduct could damage our reputation and depending on the circumstances subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects financial condition results of operations cash flows and the market value of our stock 

we may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are supported by third party vendors including cloud services to manage and operate our business we invest in new information technology systems designed to improve our operations if these systems cease to function properly if these systems experience security breaches or disruptions or if these systems do not 

provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

security breaches or disruptions of our technology systems infrastructure or products could negatively impact our business and financial results 

our information technology systems networks and infrastructure and technology embedded in certain of our control products may be subject to cyber attacks and unauthorized security intrusions it is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period like other large companies certain of our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious code unauthorized access phishing attempts denialofservice attacks and other cyber attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage information technology systems are constantly changing and evolving despite having instituted security policies and business continuity plans and implementing and regularly reviewing and updating processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access the everevolving threats mean we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data hardware software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or deployment or other problems that could unexpectedly result in security breaches or disruptions our systems networks and certain of our control products may also be vulnerable to system damage malicious attacks from hackers employee errors or misconduct viruses power and utility outages and other catastrophic events any of these incidents could cause significant harm to our business by negatively impacting our business operations compromising the security of our proprietary information or the personally identifiable information of our customers employees and business partners exposing us to litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties fines fees or liabilities such events could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could damage our reputation which could adversely affect our business our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to a cybersecurity attack or disruptions resulting from such attacks customers are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands in addition data privacy and protection laws are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges which increase our costs affect our competitiveness and can expose us to substantial fines or other penalties 

commodity shortages and price increases could adversely affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities particularly steel and nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in the prices of these commodities or the impact of inflationary increases could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows conversely in the event there is deflation we may experience pressure from our customers to reduce prices there can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows while we may use financial derivatives or supplier price locks to hedge against this volatility by using these instruments we may potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in prices and could experience lower margins in periods of declining commodity prices in addition while hedging activity may minimize nearterm volatility of the commodity prices it would not protect us from longterm commodity price increases 

some of our purchases are from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of cost effectiveness uniqueness of design or product quality if these suppliers encounter financial or operating difficulties we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

at december 31 2019  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled  68 billion and  28 billion  respectively in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we assess these assets annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of an asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the asset significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and sustained market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairments to goodwill or other indefinitelived assets any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the periods recognized 

global climate change and related regulations could negatively affect our business 

refrigerants are essential to many of our products and there is concern regarding the global warming potential of such materials as such national regional and international regulations and policies are being implemented to curtail their use as regulations reduce the use of the current class of widely used refrigerants our next generation solutions are being adopted globally with sales in more than 30 countries to date our climate commitment requires us to offer a full line of next generation lower global warming potential products by 2030 without compromising safety or energy efficiency additionally we committed to increase energy efficiency and reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of our operations by 35 percent by 2020 which we achieved in 2018 two years early while we are committed to pursuing these sustainable solutions there can be no assurance that our commitments will be successful that our products will be accepted by the market that proposed regulation or deregulation will not have a negative competitive impact or that economic returns will match the investment that we are making in new product development 

concerns regarding global climate change have resulted in the kigali amendment to the montreal protocol pursuant to which countries have agreed to a scheduled phase down of certain high global warming potential refrigerants countries may pass regulations that are even more restrictive than this international accord some countries including the us have not yet ratified the amendment and there could be lower customer demand for next generation products in these countries there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty in addition the us withdrawal from the paris accord could affect our competitiveness in certain markets such regulatory uncertainty extends to future incentives for energy efficient buildings and vehicles and costs of compliance which may impact the demand for our products obsolescence of our products and our results of operations 

natural disasters epidemics or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and may not be fully covered by insurance 

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including hurricanes fires earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks or other unexpected events in the us or in other countries in which we operate or are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters power outages health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our plants temporary or longterm disruption of our operations by causing business interruptions or by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing existing insurance arrangements may not provide full protection for the costs that may arise from such events particularly if such events are catastrophic in nature or occur in combination the occurrence of any of these events could increase our insurance and other operating costs or harm our sales in affected areas 

some of the markets in which we operate are cyclical and seasonal and demand for our products and services could be adversely affected by downturns in these industries 

demand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers the level of capital expenditures by our customers fluctuates based on planned expansions new builds repairs commodity prices general economic conditions availability of credit inflation interest rates market forecasts tax and regulatory developments trade policies fiscal spending and sociopolitcal factors among others 

our commercial and residential hvac businesses provide products and services to a wide range of markets including significant sales to the commercial and residential construction markets weakness in either or both of these construction markets may negatively impact the demand for our products and services 

demand for our commercial and residential hvac business is also influenced by weather conditions for instance sales in our commercial and residential hvac businesses historically tend to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because in the us and other northern hemisphere markets spring and summer are the peak seasons for sales of air conditioning systems and services the results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unusual weather patterns or events could negatively or positively affect our business and impact overall results of operations 

the business of many of our industrial customers particularly oil and gas companies are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns during such economic downturns customers in these industries historically have tended to delay major capital projects maintenance projects and upgrades 

decrease in the demand for our products and services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 

our business strategy includes acquiring companies product lines plants and assets entering into joint ventures and making investments that complement our existing businesses we also occasionally divest businesses that we own we may not identify acquisition or joint venture candidates at the same rate as the past acquisitions dispositions joint ventures and investments that we identify could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition and divestiture of strategic businesses and product lines technologies and capabilities plants and assets joint ventures and investments with the potential to strengthen our industry position to enhance our existing set of product and services offerings to increase productivity and efficiencies to grow revenues earnings and cash flow to help us stay competitive or to reduce costs there can be no assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable candidates in the future that we will consummate these transactions at rates similar to the past or that completed transactions will be successful strategic transactions may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows such transactions involve numerous other risks including 

 it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly without high costs and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our business operations any acquisitions divestitures joint ventures or investments may ultimately harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows there are additional risks related to our reverse morris trust transaction see page 15 under risks related to the transactions for more information 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including among others laws related to the environment and health and safety we have made and will be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations any violations of applicable laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties fines or other sanctions changes in current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services the us federal government and various states and municipalities have enacted or may enact legislation intended to deny government contracts to us companies that reincorporate outside of the us or have reincorporated outside of the us or may take other actions negatively impacting such companies if we are unable to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations interpretations of applicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 

intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our competitive position 

the companys intellectual property rights are important to its business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets proprietary technology technical data business processes and other confidential information although in aggregate we consider our intellectual property rights to be valuable to our operations we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single intellectual property right or any group of them in our opinion engineering production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our patents andor licenses 

nonetheless this intellectual property may be subject to challenge infringement invalidation or circumvention by third parties despite extensive security measures our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems employee theft or theft by private parties or foreign actors including those affiliated with or controlled by state actors our business and competitive position could be harmed by such events our ability to protect our intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are inadequate or undeveloped our inability to enforce our ip rights under any of these circumstances could have an impact on our competitive position and business 

risks relating to our operations and corporate structure 

our corporate structure has resulted from prior corporate reorganizations and related transactions these various transactions exposed us and our shareholders to the risks described below in addition we cannot be assured that all of the anticipated benefits of our operations and corporate structure will be realized 

changes in tax or other laws regulations or treaties including the enactment of the us tax cuts and jobs act changes in our status under us or nonus laws or adverse determinations by taxing or other governmental authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our operations and corporate structure could be impacted by changes in tax or other laws treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the us or nonus tax or other governmental authorities enacted comprehensive tax reform legislation in december 2017 known as the tax cuts and jobs act the act made broad and complex changes to the us tax code as part of the migration from a worldwide system of taxation to a modified territorial system for corporations the act imposed a transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of nonus subsidiaries we recorded certain charges and benefits in connection with the act and have taken a charge in connection with the mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings of certain of our nonus subsidiaries and we have recorded other charges and benefits set forth in greater detail in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements any additional impacts from the act will be determined as the us department of treasury andor the irs continue to release proposed and final guidance on certain relevant provisions of the act which should provide better clarity regarding the interpretation interaction and application of these rules the new law’s substantial limitations on andor elimination of certain tax deductions and the introduction of new taxing provisions among other items may increase our overall tax burden or otherwise negatively impact the company moreover our overall tax burden may also be adversely impacted by any tax law changes implemented by other countries 

notwithstanding this change in us tax law we continue to monitor for other tax changes us and nonus related from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws regulations or interpretations thereof of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted or implemented could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations moreover the organisation for economic cooperation and development has released proposals to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting such that tax laws in countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely impact us finally the european commission has been very active in investigating whether various tax regimes or private tax rulings provided by a country to particular taxpayers may constitute state aid we cannot predict the outcome of any of these potential changes or investigations in any of the jurisdictions but if any of the above occurs and impacts us this could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

while we monitor proposals and other developments that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals or regulatory changes are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax or other laws is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding the shareholders decision to reorganize in ireland limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate these examinations on their own or any subsequent litigation related to the examinations may result in additional taxes or penalties against us if the ultimate result of these audits differ from our original or adjusted estimates they could have a material impact on our tax provision 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions indemnification of directors and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states in addition irish law does not allow for any form of legal proceedings directly equivalent to the class action available in the united states 

irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemptive rights with respect to any particular allotment of shares under irish law we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares including shares that are part of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital in addition unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders when an irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a prorata basis if we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations our ability to issue shares or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 25 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders resident in the united states will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could have an adverse impact on the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of our shares will generally not be subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in ingersollrand plc 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in ingersollrand plc 

risks related to the transactions 

in april 2019 we announced that we entered into a reverse morris trust transaction with gardner denver holdings inc gdi pursuant to which we would cause specific assets and liabilities of our industrial segment to be transferred to a newly formed whollyowned subsidiary ingersollrand us holdco inc ingersoll rand industrial and then distribute the shares of common stock of ingersoll rand industrial to our shareholders the distribution charm merger sub inc which is a newly formed whollyowned subsidiary of gdi merger sub would be merged with and into ingersoll rand industrial with ingersoll rand industrial surviving such merger as a whollyowned subsidiary of gdi we refer to these transactions as the “transactions” the transactions will result in gdi acquiring our industrial business and our shareholders receiving shares of gdi as a result of the merger following the merger the combined company is expected to be renamed and operate under the name ingersoll rand inc and its common stock is expected to be listed on the new york stock exchange under our existing ticker symbol “ir” our remaining climate business will be renamed trane technologies plc and will trade under the ticker symbol “tt” 

the proposed reverse morris trust transaction with gdi is subject to various risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that the transaction will be completed on the terms or timeline contemplated if at all 

the consummation of the merger is subject to numerous conditions including i consummation of certain transactions such as the separation of the ingersoll rand industrial business from our other business and financings ii the receipt of gdi stockholder approval for the transaction and iii the receipt of certain regulatory approvals the completion of the pending reverse morris 

trust transaction is also subject to our receipt of an opinion i from us tax counsel regarding the qualification of each of the distribution of shares of a company comprised of our industrial segment businesses to our shareholders certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of such distribution and the subsequent merger of this company with gdi as a taxfree transaction for us federal income tax purposes and ii from irish tax counsel that there will be no adverse irish tax consequences other than in respect of certain tax matters relevant only to certain of our irish shareholders as a result of the transaction the completion of the transaction is also subject to the receipt by gdi of an opinion from its us tax counsel regarding the qualification of the merger as a taxfree transaction for us federal income tax purposes 

there can be no assurance that the merger and related transactions will be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or at all 

governmental agencies may not approve the merger or the related transactions necessary to complete the merger or may impose conditions to the approval of such transactions or require changes to the terms of such transactions any such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits of the merger and such condition or change might cause the company andor gdi to restructure or terminate the merger or the related transactions 

we are subject to business uncertainties while the reverse morris trust transaction with gdi is pending and the transaction may have an adverse effect on us even if not completed 

uncertainty about the effect of the pending reverse morris trust transaction with gdi on our employees customers partners and suppliers may have adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations our employees may be distracted due to uncertainty about their future roles with each of the separate companies pending the completion of the transaction and we may face challenges in attracting retaining and motivating key employees some of our suppliers or customers may delay or defer decisions or may end their relationships with us or our industrial segment businesses which could negatively affect revenues earnings and cash flows of ours and our industrial segment businesses execution of the proposed transaction will require significant time and attention from management which may distract management from the operation of our businesses and the execution of other initiatives that may have been beneficial to us any delays in completion of the proposed reverse morris trust transaction may increase the amount of time effort and expense that we devote to the transaction we will be required to pay certain costs and expenses relating to the transaction such as legal accounting and other professional fees whether or not it is completed we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets if we fail to complete the transaction any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and the market price of our shares 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the transaction 

although we believe that the pending reverse morris trust transaction will provide financial operational managerial and other benefits to us and our shareholders the transaction may not provide the results on the scope or on the scale we anticipate and the assumed benefits of the transaction may not be fully realized accordingly the transaction might not provide us and our shareholders benefits or value in excess of the benefits and value that might have been created or realized had we retained the industrial segment businesses or undertaken another strategic alternative involving such businesses following the separation distribution and subsequent merger our remaining company trane technologies will be less diversified with a focus on climate control solutions for buildings homes and transportation and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition these changes may not meet some shareholders’ investment strategies which could cause investors to sell their holdings in our shares and result in a decrease in the market price of our shares 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions do not qualify as taxfree under sections 355 and 368a of the code including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of the company or gdi then the company and our shareholders may be required to pay substantial us federal income taxes and gdi may be obligated to indemnify the company for such taxes imposed on the company 

the distribution together with certain related transactions and the merger are conditioned upon our receipt of an opinion of counsel to the effect that the distribution together with certain related transactions will qualify as taxfree to our company ingersoll rand industrial other of our subsidiaries and our shareholders as applicable for us federal income tax purposes the opinion of our counsel will be based on among other things certain representations and assumptions as to factual matters made by gdi ingersoll rand industrial and the company the failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true correct and complete in all material respects could adversely affect the validity of the opinion of counsel an opinion of counsel represents counsel’s best legal judgment is not binding on the internal revenue service irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinion will be based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect 

the distribution will be taxable to the company pursuant to section 355e of the code if there is a 50 or greater change in ownership of either the company or ingersoll rand industrial directly or indirectly as part of a plan or series of related transactions 

that include the distribution a section 355e change of ownership would not make the distribution taxable to our shareholders but instead may result in corporatelevel taxable gain to certain of our subsidiaries because our shareholders will collectively be treated as owning more than 50 of the gdi common stock following the merger the merger alone should not cause the distribution to be taxable to our subsidiaries under section 355e however section 355e might apply if other acquisitions of stock of the company before or after the merger or of gdi before or after the merger are considered to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution together with certain related transactions if section 355e applied certain of our subsidiaries might recognize a very substantial amount of taxable gain although if this applied as a result of certain actions taken by ingersoll rand industrial gdi or certain specified gdi stockholders gdi would be required to bear the cost of any resultant tax liability under section 355e pursuant to the terms of the tax matters agreement 

if the merger does not qualify as a taxfree reorganization under section 368a of the code our shareholders may be required to pay substantial us federal income taxes 

the obligations of ingersoll rand industrial and gdi to consummate the merger are conditioned respectively on our receipt of an opinion from our counsel and gdi’s receipt of an opinion from their counsel in each case to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the code these opinions will be based upon among other things certain representations and assumptions as to factual matters made by gdi the company ingersoll rand industrial and merger sub the failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true correct and complete in all material respects could adversely affect the validity of the opinions an opinion of counsel represents counsel’s best legal judgment is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinions will be based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the merger were taxable us holders of ingersoll rand industrial would be considered to have made a taxable sale of their ingersoll rand industrial common stock to gdi and such us holders of ingersoll rand industrial would generally recognize taxable gain or loss on their receipt of gdi common stock in the merger

operating incomemargin 

operating margin remained flat at 122 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared with the same period of 2018  factors impacting operating margin included material and other inflation an unfavorable shift in product mix primarily related to faster growth in equipment sales compared to higher margin service and parts sales industrial segment separationrelated costs and pfs acquisitionrelated costs increased spending on business investments and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements these unfavorable impacts were offset by improved pricing and productivity gains refer to the results by segment below for a discussion of operating margin by segment 

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2019 increased by  223 million compared with the same period of 2018  the increase primarily relates to new debt issuances during the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 during the first quarter of 2018 we incurred 154 million of premium expense and 12 million of unamortized costs in interest expense as a result of the redemption of 11 billion of senior notes

provision for income taxes 

the 2019 effective tax rate was 203 which is slightly lower than the us statutory rate of 21 primarily due to a reduction in deferred tax asset valuation allowances for certain nonus net deferred tax assets and excess tax benefits from employee sharebased payments these amounts were partially offset by us state and local taxes an increase in a deferred tax asset valuation allowance for certain state net deferred tax assets and certain nondeductible expenses in addition the reduction was also driven by earnings in nonus jurisdictions which in aggregate have a lower effective tax rate revenues from nonus jurisdictions accounted for approximately 34 of our total 2019 revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income was earned and 

taxed outside the us at rates ranging from 0 to 38 when comparing the results of multiple reporting periods among other factors the mix of earnings between us and foreign jurisdictions can cause variability in our overall effective tax rate 

the 2018 effective tax rate was 169 which is lower than the us statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the measurement period adjustment related to the change in permanent reinvestment assertion on unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries the deduction for foreign derived intangible income the recognition of excess tax benefits from employee share based payments and a reduction in a valuation allowance for certain state net deferred tax assets this decrease was partially offset by the measurement period adjustment related to a valuation allowance on excess foreign tax credits us state and local income taxes and certain nondeductible employee expenses in addition the reduction was also driven by earnings in nonus jurisdictions which in aggregate have a lower effective tax rate revenues from nonus jurisdictions accounted for approximately 36 of our total 2018 revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income was earned and taxed outside the us at rates ranging from 0 to 38 when comparing the results of multiple reporting periods among other factors the mix of earnings between us and foreign jurisdictions can cause variability in our overall effective tax rate

year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018  results by segment 

segment operating income on an as reported basis is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for performance reviews compensation and resource allocation for these reasons we believe that segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss we define segment operating margin as segment operating income as a percentage of net revenues  



climate 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 increased by 59 or  7321 million  compared with the same period of 2018  the components of the period change are as follows 



segment operating margin increased 30 basis points to 146 for the year ended december 31 2019  compared with 143 for the same period of 2018  the increase was primarily driven by higher volume improved pricing and productivity gains partially offset by increased spend on investments and restructuring material and other inflation and a shift in product mix primarily related to faster growth in equipment sales compared to higher margin service and parts sales 

industrial 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 increased by 60 or  1986 million  compared with the same period of 2018  the components of the period change are as follows 



segment operating margin increased 70 basis points to 129 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared with 122 for the same period of 2018  the increase was primarily driven by productivity benefits decreased spending on restructuring and pricing improvements partially offset by lower volumes unfavorable foreign currency movements material and other inflation and a shift in product mix primarily related to faster growth in equipment sales compared to higher margin service and parts sales 

unallocated corporate expense 

unallocated corporate expense for the year ended december 31 2019 increased by 361 or  918 million  compared with the same period of 2018  the primary drivers of the increase were due to industrial segment separationrelated costs of 946 million and pfs acquisitionrelated transaction costs of 129 million these costs were partially offset by lower functional costs 

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities in doing so we review and analyze our current cash on hand the number of days our sales are outstanding inventory turns capital expenditure commitments and income tax payments our cash requirements primarily consist of the following 

 

our primary sources of liquidity include cash balances on hand cash flows from operations proceeds from debt offerings commercial paper and borrowing availability under our existing credit facilities we earn a significant amount of our operating income in jurisdictions where it is deemed to be permanently reinvested our most prominent jurisdiction of operation is the us we expect existing cash and cash equivalents available to the us operations the cash generated by our us operations our committed credit lines as well as our expected ability to access the capital and debt markets will be sufficient to fund our us operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future in addition we expect existing nonus cash and cash equivalents and the cash generated by our nonus operations will be sufficient to fund our nonus operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

as of december 31 2019  we had 13036 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand of which 9313 million was held by nonus subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries are generally available for use in our us operations via intercompany loans equity infusions or via distributions from direct or indirectly owned nonus subsidiaries for 

which we do not assert permanent reinvestment as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act in 2017 additional repatriation opportunities to access cash and cash equivalents held by nonus subsidiaries have been created in general repatriation of cash to the us can be completed with no significant incremental us tax however to the extent that we repatriate funds from nonus subsidiaries for which we assert permanent reinvestment to fund our us operations we would be required to accrue and pay applicable nonus taxes as of december 31 2019  we currently have no plans to repatriate funds from subsidiaries for which we assert permanent reinvestment 

share repurchases are made from time to time in accordance with managements capital allocation strategy subject to market conditions and regulatory requirements in february 2017 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15 billion of our ordinary shares under a share repurchase program the 2017 authorization upon completion of the prior authorized share repurchase program repurchases under the 2017 authorization began in may 2017 and ended in december 2018 completing the program in october 2018 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15 billion of our ordinary shares under a share repurchase program 2018 authorization upon completion of the 2017 authorization no material amounts were repurchased under this program in 2018 during the year ended december 31 2019 we repurchased and canceled approximately 750 million of our ordinary shares leaving approximately 750 million remaining under the 2018 authorization

investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities represents inflows and outflows regarding the purchase and sale of assets primary activities associated with these items include capital expenditures proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment acquisitions investments in joint ventures and divestitures during the year ended december 31 2019  net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 17800 million  the primary driver of the usage was attributable to acquisitions in the period including pfs in which the total outflow net of cash acquired was approximately  15 billion  other outflows included capital expenditures of  2541 million  during the year ended december 31 2018  net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 6294 million  the primary driver of the usage is attributable to the acquisition of several businesses and the investment of a 50 ownership interest in a joint venture with mitsubishi the total outflow net of cash acquired was 2852 million  other outflows included capital expenditures of 3656 million  

financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities represent inflows and outflows that account for external activities affecting equity and debt primary activities associated with these actions include paying dividends to shareholders repurchasing our own shares issuing our stock and debt transactions during the year ended december 31 2019  net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was 2705 million  the primary driver of the inflow related to the issuance of  15 billion of senior notes during the period to finance the acquisition of pfs and other general corporate expenses this amount was partially offset by the repurchase of 64 million ordinary shares totaling  7501 million and  5101 million of dividends paid to ordinary shareholders during the year ended december 31 2018  net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 13788 million  primary drivers of the cash outflow related to the repurchase of 97 million ordinary shares totaling 9002 million and 4795 million of 

dividends paid to ordinary shareholders in addition we issued  115 billion of senior notes which was predominately offset by the redemption of  11 billion of senior notes 

discontinued operations 

cash flows from discontinued operations primarily represent ongoing costs associated with postretirement benefits product liability and legal costs from previously sold businesses net cash used in discontinued operating activities during the year ended december 31 2019 was 368 million and primarily related to ongoing costs partially offset by settlements reached with several insurance carriers associated with pending asbestos insurance coverage litigation net cash used in discontinued operating activities for the year ended december 31 2018 was 667 million and primarily related to ongoing costs 

capital resources 

based on historical performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance the cash generated from our operations our committed credit lines and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures dividends share repurchases upcoming debt maturities and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the foreseeable future 

capital expenditures were  2541 million   3656 million and  2213 million for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively our investments continue to improve manufacturing productivity reduce costs provide environmental enhancements upgrade information technology infrastructure and security and advanced technologies for existing facilities the capital expenditure program for 2020 is estimated to be approximately one to two percent of revenues including amounts approved in prior periods many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at our option without incurring substantial charges 

for financial market risk impacting the company see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

capitalization 

in addition to cash on hand and operating cash flow we maintain significant credit availability under our commercial paper program our ability to borrow at a costeffective rate under the commercial paper program is contingent upon maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating as of december 31 2019  our credit ratings were as follows remaining unchanged from 2018  



the credit ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

our public debt does not contain financial covenants and our revolving credit lines have a debttototal capital covenant of 65 as of december 31 2019  our debttototal capital ratio was significantly beneath this limit 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment period 



 future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above 

pensions 

at december 31 2019  we had a net unfunded liability of  7144 million  which consists of noncurrent pension assets of  504 million and current and noncurrent pension benefit liabilities of  7648 million  it is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required we currently project that we will contribute approximately  90 million to our enterprise plans worldwide in 2020  the timing and amounts of future contributions are dependent upon the funding status of the plan which is expected to vary as a result of changes in interest rates returns on underlying assets and other factors therefore pension contributions have been excluded from the preceding table see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding pensions 

postretirement benefits other than pensions 

at december 31 2019  we had postretirement benefit obligations of  4288 million  we fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a payasyougo basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations benefit payments which are net of expected plan participant contributions and medicare part d subsidy are expected to be approximately  42 million in 2020  because benefit payments are not required to be funded in advance and the timing and amounts of future payments are dependent on the cost of benefits for retirees covered by the plan they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding postretirement benefits other than pensions 

income taxes 

at december 31 2019  we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of  782 million and  169 million of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax the liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits 

contingent liabilities 

we are involved in various litigation claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding contingent liabilities 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from these estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

 the determination of estimated fair value requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows including profit margins longterm forecasts discount rates and terminal growth rates we developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit for our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2019 we calculated the fair value for each of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangibles based on the results of these calculations and further outlined below we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

goodwill  impairment of goodwill is assessed at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for 

determining whether it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test under asc 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other asc 350 for those reporting units that bypass or fail the qualitative assessment the test compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair value is determined using three valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model an income approach a marketadjusted multiple of earnings and revenues a market approach and a similar transactions method also a market approach the discounted cash flow approach relies on our estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing growth and margins with due consideration given to forecasting risk the earnings and revenue multiple approach reflects the markets expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publicly traded companies and the subject reporting units the similar transactions method considers prices paid in transactions that have recently occurred in our industry or in related industries these valuation techniques are weighted 50 40 and 10 respectively 

under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 100 to 130 and terminal growth rates ranging from 20 to 35 under the guideline public company method we used an adjusted multiple ranging from 55 to 130 of projected earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda based on the market information of comparable companies additionally we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization for all reporting units except one in latin america the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 32 the one reporting unit with a percentage of carrying value less than 32 exceeded its carrying value by 54 the reporting unit reported within the climate segment has approximately 190 million of goodwill at the testing date a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units 

other indefinitelived intangible assets – impairment of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is first assessed using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired this assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset for those indefinitelived assets where it is required a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology income approach which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value would be recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess 

in testing our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 100 to 145 terminal growth rates of 30 and royalty rates ranging from 05 to 45 a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our tradenames 



 the transaction price allocated to performance obligations reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from a customer to determine the transaction price variable and noncash consideration are assessed as well as whether a significant financing component exists we include variable consideration in the estimated transaction price when it is probable that significant reversal of revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with variable consideration is subsequently resolved we consider historical data in determining our best estimates of variable consideration and the related accruals are recorded using the expected value method 

we enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple goods and services such as equipment installation and extended warranties for these arrangements each good or service is evaluated to determine whether it represents a distinct performance obligation and whether the sales price for each obligation is representative of standalone selling price if available we utilize observable prices for goods or services sold separately to similar customers in similar circumstances to evaluate relative standalone selling price list prices are used if they are determined to be representative of standalone selling prices where necessary we ensure that the total transaction price is then allocated to the distinct performance obligations based on the determination of their relative standalone selling price at the inception of the arrangement 

we recognize revenue for delivered goods or services when the delivered good or service is distinct control of the good or service has transferred to the customer and only customary refund or return rights related to the goods or services exist for extended warranties and longterm service agreements revenue for these distinct performance obligations are recognized over time on a straightline basis over the respective contract term 

 the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our 

original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 

 the rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan’s investment policy the types of assets held and the target asset allocation the expected longterm rate of return is determined as of each measurement date we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors 

changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the expected 2020 net periodic pension cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 88 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately 77 million a 025 rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would increase expected 2020 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by 07 million and a 10 increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the service and interest cost by approximately 05 million

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world 

many of our nonus operations have a functional currency other than the us dollar and their results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes therefore our reported results will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency our largest concentration of revenues from nonus operations as of december 31 2019 are in euros and chinese yuan a hypothetical 10 unfavorable change in the average exchange rate used to translate net revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 from either euros or chinese yuanbased operations into us dollars would not have a material impact on our financial statements 

we use derivative instruments to hedge those material exposures that cannot be naturally offset the instruments utilized are viewed as risk management tools primarily involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2019  a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an unrealized loss of approximately  232 million  as compared with  176 million at december 31 2018  these amounts when realized would be offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2019  

interest rate exposure 

our debt portfolio mainly consists of fixedrate instruments and therefore any fluctuation in market interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations

products and services 

our principal products and services by business segment include the following 





these products are sold primarily under our name and under other names including american standard aro club car nexia thermo king and trane 

acquisitions and equity investments 

in may 2018 we completed our investment of a 50 ownership interest in a joint venture with mitsubishi electric corporation mitsubishi the joint venture reported within the climate segment focuses on marketing selling and supporting variable refrigerant flow vrf and ductless heating and air conditioning systems through trane american standard and mitsubishi channels in the us and select latin american countries 

 4 

in january 2018 we acquired 100 of the outstanding stock of ics group holdings limited ics cool energy the acquired business reported within the climate segment specializes in the temporary rental of energy efficient chillers for commercial and industrial buildings across europe it also sells permanently installs and services high performance temperature control systems for all types of industrial processes 

during 2017 we acquired several businesses including channel acquisitions that complement existing products and services acquisitions within the climate segment primarily consisted of independent dealers which support the ongoing strategy to expand our distribution network in north america other acquisitions within the segment strengthen our product portfolio acquisitions within the industrial segment primarily consisted of a telematics business which builds upon our growing portfolio of connected assets in addition other acquisitions within the segment expand sales and service channels across the globe 

 competitive conditions 

our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world due to the diversity of these products and services and the variety of markets served we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line and services they include wellestablished regional or specialized competitors as well as larger us and nonus corporations or divisions of larger companies 

the principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price quality delivery service and support technology and innovation we believe that we are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of hvac systems and services air compression systems transport temperature control products power tools and golf utility and consumer lowspeed vehicles 

distribution 

our products are distributed by a number of methods which we believe are appropriate to the type of product us sales are made through branch sales offices distributors and dealers across the country nonus sales are made through numerous subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world 

operations by geographic area 

approximately 36  of our net revenues in 2018  were derived outside the us and we sold products in more than 100 countries therefore the attendant risks of manufacturing or selling in a particular country such as currency devaluation nationalization and establishment of common markets may have an adverse impact on our nonus operations 

customers 

we have no customer that accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues in 2018  2017  or 2016  no material part of our business is dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers therefore the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

raw materials 

we manufacture many of the components included in our products which requires us to employ a wide variety of commodities principal commodities such as steel copper and aluminum are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future there have been no commodity shortages which have had a material adverse effect on our businesses 

working capital 

we manufacture products that must be readily available to meet our customers’ rapid delivery requirements therefore we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs and our customers’ requirements such working capital requirements are not however in the opinion of management materially different from those experienced by our major competitors we believe our sales and payment terms are competitive in and appropriate for the markets in which we compete 

seasonality 

demand for certain of our products and services is influenced by weather conditions for instance sales in our commercial and residential hvac businesses historically tend to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because this represents spring and summer in the us and other northern hemisphere markets which are the peak seasons for sales of air conditioning systems and services therefore results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unusual weather patterns or events could negatively or positively affect certain segments of our business and impact overall results of operations 

 5 

research and development 

we engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products enhance existing product effectiveness improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate in addition we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment or acquisition we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development activities as we look to maintain and improve our competitive position 

patents and licenses 

we own numerous patents and patent applications and are licensed under others although in aggregate we consider our patents and licenses to be valuable to our operations we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single patent or license or any group of them in our opinion engineering production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our patents andor licenses 

backlog 

our approximate backlog of orders believed to be firm at december 31  was as follows 



these backlog figures are based on orders received while the major portion of our products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock orders for specialized machinery or specific customer application are submitted with extensive lead times and are often subject to revision and deferral and to a lesser extent cancellation or termination we expect to ship a majority of the december 31 2018  backlog during 2019  

environmental matters 

we continue to be dedicated to environmental and sustainability programs to minimize the use of natural resources and reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials from our manufacturing processes and to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the environmental protection agency and similar state authorities we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future 

for a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

asbestosrelated matters 

certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries and former companies are named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in state and federal courts in many of the lawsuits a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants the vast majority of those claims allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products primarily pumps boilers and railroad brake shoes none of our existing or previouslyowned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos

 item 1a  risk factors   

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to a number of risks that could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k the risks set forth below are those we consider most significant we face other risks however that we do not currently perceive to be material which could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from our expectations you should evaluate all risks before you invest in our securities if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted in that case the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally these activities are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

 these risks could increase our cost of doing business internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations limit our ability to sell products in certain markets and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we face significant competition in the markets that we serve and our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

the markets that we serve are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products there has been consolidation and new entrants including nontraditional competitors within our industries and there may be future consolidation and new entrants which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the competitive landscape in which we operate due to our global footprint we are competing worldwide with large companies and with smaller local operators who may have customer regulatory or economic advantages in the geographies in which they are located in addition some of our competitors may employ pricing and other strategies that are not traditional 

in addition we must develop and commercialize new products and services in a rapidly changing technological and business environment in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business the development and commercialization of new products and services require a significant investment of resources and an anticipation of the impact of new technologies and the ability to compete with others who may have superior resources we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by our current and future markets failure to develop new products and services that are accepted by these markets could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and long term credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategies 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit at interest rates and on terms that are acceptable to them could lead to 

 9 

insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world 

many of our nonus operations have a functional currency other than the us dollar and their results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes therefore our reported results will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 

we use derivative instruments to hedge those material exposures that cannot be naturally offset the instruments utilized are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business or the business operations of previouslyowned entities our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation contract claims or other commercial disputes product liability product defects and asbestosrelated matters that cannot be predicted with certainty moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against the total aggregate amount of losses sustained as a result of such proceedings and contingencies as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other events could affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption antibribery export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any violations of law or improper conduct could damage our reputation and depending on the circumstances subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects financial condition results of operations cash flows and the market value of our stock 

we may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are supported by third party vendors including cloud services to manage and operate our business we are also investing in new information technology systems that are designed to continue improving our operations if these systems cease to function properly if these systems experience security breaches or disruptions or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 10 

security breaches or disruptions of our technology systems infrastructure or products could negatively impact our business and financial results 

our information technology systems networks and infrastructure and technology embedded in certain of our control products may be subject to cyber attacks and unauthorized security intrusions it is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period like other large companies certain of our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access phishing efforts denialofservice attacks and other cyber attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly changing and evolving despite having instituted security policies and business continuity plans and implementing and regularly reviewing and updating processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access the everevolving threats mean we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data hardware software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly result in security breaches or disruptions our systems networks and certain of our control products may also be vulnerable to system damage malicious attacks from hackers employee errors or misconduct viruses power and utility outages and other catastrophic events any of these incidents could cause significant harm to our business by negatively impacting our business operations compromising the security of our proprietary information or the personally identifiable data relating to our customers employees and business partners and exposing us to litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties fines fees or liabilities such events could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could damage our reputation which could adversely affect our business our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to a cybersecurity attack or disruptions resulting from such attacks customers are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands in addition data privacy and protection laws are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges which increase our costs affect our competitiveness and can expose us to substantial fines or other penalties 

commodity shortages and price increases could adversely affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities particularly steel and nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in the prices of these commodities or the impact of inflationary increases could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows conversely in the event there is deflation we may experience pressure from our customers to reduce prices there can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows while we may use financial derivatives or supplier price locks to hedge against this volatility by using these instruments we may potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in prices and could experience lower margins in periods of declining commodity prices in addition while hedging activity may minimize nearterm volatility of the commodity prices it would not protect us from longterm commodity price increases 

some of our purchases are from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of cost effectiveness uniqueness of design or product quality if these suppliers encounter financial or operating difficulties we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

at december 31 2018  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled  60 billion  and  27 billion  respectively in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and sustained market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairments to goodwill or other indefinitelived assets any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the periods recognized 

global climate change and related regulations could negatively affect our business 

refrigerants are essential to many of our products and there is a growing awareness and concern regarding the global warming potential of such materials as such national regional and international regulations and policies are being considered to curtail their use as regulations reduce the use of the current class of widely used refrigerants our next generation solutions are being adopted globally with sales in 32 countries to date our climate commitment requires us to fully transition out of current refrigerants 

 11 

by 2030 without compromising safety or energy efficiency additionally we committed to increase energy efficiency and reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of our operations by 35 percent by 2020 which we achieved in 2018 two years early while we are committed to pursuing these sustainable solutions there can be no assurance that our commitments will be successful that our products will be accepted by the market that proposed regulation or deregulation will not have a negative competitive impact or that economic returns will match the investment that we are making in new product development 

concerns regarding global climate change have resulted in the kigali amendment to the montreal protocol pursuant to which countries have agreed to a scheduled phase down of certain high global warming potential refrigerants industrial countries may pass regulations that are even more restrictive than these international accords some countries including the us have not yet ratified the amendment and there could be lower customer demand for next generation products in these countries there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty in addition the us withdrawal from the paris accord could affect our competitiveness in certain markets such regulatory uncertainty extends to future incentives for energy efficient buildings and vehicles and costs of compliance which may impact the demand for our products obsolescence of our products and our results of operations 

natural disasters or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and may not be fully covered by insurance 

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including hurricanes fires earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the us or in other countries in which we operate or are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our plants temporary or longterm disruption of our operations by causing business interruptions or by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing existing insurance arrangements may not provide full protection for the costs that may arise from such events particularly if such events are catastrophic in nature or occur in combination the occurrence of any of these events could increase our insurance and other operating costs 

some of the markets in which we operate are cyclical and seasonal and demand for our products and services could be adversely affected by downturns in these industries 

demand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers the level of capital expenditures by our customers fluctuates based on planned expansions new builds repairs commodity prices general economic conditions availability of credit inflation interest rates market forecasts tax and regulatory developments trade policies fiscal spending and sociopolitcal factors among others 

our commercial and residential hvac businesses provide products and services to a wide range of markets including significant sales to the commercial and residential construction markets weakness in either or both of these construction markets may negatively impact the demand for our products and services 

demand for our commercial and residential hvac business is also influenced by weather conditions for instance sales in our commercial and residential hvac businesses historically tend to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because in the us and other northern hemisphere markets spring and summer are the peak seasons for sales of air conditioning systems and services the results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unusual weather patterns or events could negatively or positively affect our business and impact overall results of operations 

the business of many of our industrial customers particularly oil and gas companies are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns during such economic downturns customers in these industries historically have tended to delay major capital projects maintenance projects and upgrades 

decrease in the demand for our products and services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 

 12 

our business strategy includes acquiring companies product lines plants and assets entering into joint ventures and making investments that complement our existing businesses we also occasionally divest businesses that we own we may not identify acquisition or joint venture candidates at the same rate as the past acquisitions dispositions joint ventures and investments that we identify could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition and divestiture of strategic businesses and product lines technologies and capabilities plants and assets joint ventures and investments with the potential to strengthen our industry position to enhance our existing set of product and services offerings to increase productivity and efficiencies to grow revenues earnings and cash flow to help us stay competitive or to reduce costs there can be no assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable candidates in the future that we will consummate these transactions at rates similar to the past or that completed transactions will be successful strategic transactions may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows such transactions involve numerous other risks including 

 it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly without high costs and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our business operations any acquisitions divestitures joint ventures or investments may ultimately harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including among others laws related to the environment and health and safety we have made and will be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations any violations of applicable laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties fines or other sanctions changes in current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services the us federal government and various states and municipalities have enacted or may enact legislation intended to deny government contracts to us companies that reincorporate outside of the us or have reincorporated outside of the us or may take other actions negatively impacting such companies if we are unable to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations interpretations of applicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 

risks relating to our operations and corporate structure 

our corporate structure has resulted from prior corporate reorganizations and related transactions these various transactions exposed us and our shareholders to the risks described below in addition we cannot be assured that all of the anticipated benefits of our operations and corporate structure will be realized 

 13 

changes in tax or other laws regulations or treaties including the enactment of the us tax cuts and jobs act changes in our status under us or nonus laws or adverse determinations by taxing or other governmental authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our operations and corporate structure could be impacted by changes in tax or other laws treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the us or nonus tax or other governmental authorities enacted comprehensive tax reform legislation in december 2017 known as the tax cuts and jobs act the act made broad and complex changes to the us tax code as part of the migration from a worldwide system of taxation to a modified territorial system for corporations the act imposed a transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of nonus subsidiaries we recorded certain charges and benefits in connection with the act and have taken a charge in connection with the mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings of certain of our nonus subsidiaries and we have recorded other charges and benefits set forth in greater detail in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements any additional impacts from the act will be determined as the us department of treasury andor the irs continue to release proposed and final guidance on certain relevant provisions of the act which should provide better clarity regarding the interpretation interaction and application of these rules the new law’s substantial limitations on andor elimination of certain tax deductions and the introduction of new taxing provisions among other items may increase our overall tax burden or otherwise negatively impact the company moreover our overall tax burden may also be adversely impacted by any tax law changes implemented by other countries 

notwithstanding this change in us tax law we continue to monitor for other tax changes us and nonus related from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws regulations or interpretations thereof of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted or implemented could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations moreover the organisation for economic cooperation and development has released proposals to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting such that tax laws in countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely impact us finally the european commission has been very active in investigating whether various tax regimes or private tax rulings provided by a country to particular taxpayers may constitute state aid we cannot predict the outcome of any of these potential changes or investigations in any of the jurisdictions but if any of the above occurs and impacts us this could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

while we monitor proposals and other developments that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals or regulatory changes are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax or other laws is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding the shareholders decision to reorganize in ireland limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate these examinations on their own or any subsequent litigation related to the examinations may result in additional taxes or penalties against us if the ultimate result of these audits differ from our original or adjusted estimates they could have a material impact on our tax provision 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities   

the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

 14 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemptive rights with respect to any particular allotment of shares under irish law we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares including shares that are part of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital in addition unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders when an irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a prorata basis if we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations our ability to issue shares or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax   

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders resident in the united states will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could have an adverse impact on the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax   

dividends paid in respect of our shares will generally not be subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in ingersollrand plc 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in ingersollrand plc

the 2016 effective tax rate was 162 which is lower than the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the tax treatment of the hussmann gain the gain which is not subject to tax under the relevant local tax laws decreased the effective tax rate by 48 in addition the reduction was also driven by earnings in nonus jurisdictions which in aggregate have a lower effective tax rate revenues from nonus jurisdictions accounts for approximately 35 of our total revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income was earned and taxed outside the us at rates ranging from 0 to 38 when comparing the results of multiple reporting periods among other factors the mix of earnings between us and foreign jurisdictions can cause variability in our overall effective tax rate 

discontinued operations 

the components of discontinued operations net of tax  for the years ended december 31 are as follows 



discontinued operations are retained costs from previously sold businesses including postretirement benefits product liability and legal costs in addition we include costs associated with ingersollrand company for the settlement and defense of asbestosrelated claims insurance settlements on asbestosrelated matters and the revaluation of its liability for potential future claims for the year ended december 31 2016 ongoing costs were more than offset by asbestosrelated settlements with various insurance carriers a portion of the tax benefit expense in each period represents adjustments for certain tax matters associated with the 2013 spinoff of our commercial and residential security business now an independent public company operating under the name of allegion 

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities in doing so we review and analyze our current cash on hand the number of days our sales are outstanding inventory turns capital expenditure commitments and income tax payments our cash requirements primarily consist of the following 

 

our primary sources of liquidity include cash balances on hand cash flows from operations proceeds from debt offerings commercial paper and borrowing availability under our existing credit facilities we earn a significant amount of our operating income in jurisdictions where it is deemed to be permanently reinvested our most prominent jurisdiction of operation is the us we expect existing cash and cash equivalents available to the us operations the cash generated by our us operations our committed credit lines as well as our expected ability to access the capital and debt markets will be sufficient to fund our us operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future in addition we expect existing nonus cash and cash equivalents and the cash generated by our nonus operations will be sufficient to fund our nonus operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

as of december 31 2018  we had 9034 million  of cash and cash equivalents on hand of which 6897 million  was held by nonus subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries are generally available for use in our us operations 

 28 

via intercompany loans equity infusions or via distributions from direct or indirectly owned nonus subsidiaries for which we do not assert permanent reinvestment as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act in 2017 additional repatriation opportunities to access cash and cash equivalents held by nonus subsidiaries have been created in general repatriation of cash to the us can be completed with no significant incremental us tax however to the extent that we repatriate funds from nonus subsidiaries for which we assert permanent reinvestment to fund our us operations we would be required to accrue and pay applicable nonus taxes as of december 31 2018  we currently have no plans to repatriate funds from subsidiaries for which we assert permanent reinvestment 

share repurchases are made from time to time in accordance with managements capital allocation strategy subject to market conditions and regulatory requirements in february 2017 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15 billion of our ordinary shares under a share repurchase program the 2017 authorization upon completion of the prior authorized share repurchase program repurchases under the 2017 authorization began in may 2017 and ended in december 2018 completing the program in october 2018 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15 billion of our ordinary shares upon completion of the 2017 authorization however no material amounts were repurchased under this program during 2018 in june 2018 we announced an increase in our quarterly share dividend from 045 to 053 per ordinary share this reflects an 18 increase that began with our september 2018 payment and an 83 increase since the beginning of 2016 we continue to be active with acquisitions and joint venture activity since the beginning of 2017 we entered into a joint venture and acquired several businesses including channel acquisitions that complement existing products and services further growing our product portfolio in addition we incur ongoing costs associated with restructuring initiatives intended to result in improved operating performance profitability and working capital levels actions associated with these initiatives may include workforce reductions improving manufacturing productivity realignment of management structures and rationalizing certain assets we expect that our available cash flow committed credit lines and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to fund share repurchases dividends ongoing restructuring actions acquisitions and joint venture activity

 30 

discontinued operations

capital resources 

based on historical performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance the cash generated from our operations our committed credit lines and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures dividends share repurchases upcoming debt maturities and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the foreseeable future 

capital expenditures were  3656 million   2213 million  and  1827 million  for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively our investments continue to improve manufacturing productivity reduce costs provide environmental enhancements upgrade information technology infrastructure and security and advanced technologies for existing facilities the capital expenditure program for 2019  is estimated to be approximately 300 million including amounts approved in prior periods many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at our option without incurring substantial charges 

for financial market risk impacting the company see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

capitalization 

in addition to cash on hand and operating cash flow we maintain significant credit availability under our commercial paper program our ability to borrow at a costeffective rate under the commercial paper program is contingent upon maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating as of december 31 2018  our credit ratings were as follows 



the credit ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

our public debt does not contain financial covenants and our revolving credit lines have a debttototal capital covenant of 65 as of december 31 2018  our debttototal capital ratio was 367  and significantly beneath this limit 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment period 



 future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above 

 31 

pensions 

at december 31 2018  we had a net unfunded liability of  6984 million  which consists of noncurrent pension assets of  499 million  and current and noncurrent pension benefit liabilities of  7483 million  it is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required we currently project that we will contribute approximately  104 million  to our plans worldwide in 2019  the timing and amounts of future contributions are dependent upon the funding status of the plan which is expected to vary as a result of changes in interest rates returns on underlying assets and other factors therefore pension contributions have been excluded from the preceding table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding pensions 

postretirement benefits other than pensions 

at december 31 2018  we had postretirement benefit obligations of  4427 million  we fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a payasyougo basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations benefit payments which are net of expected plan participant contributions and medicare part d subsidy are expected to be approximately  46 million  in 2019  because benefit payments are not required to be funded in advance and the timing and amounts of future payments are dependent on the cost of benefits for retirees covered by the plan they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding postretirement benefits other than pensions 

income taxes 

at december 31 2018  we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of  830 million  and  207 million  of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax the liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits 

contingent liabilities 

we are involved in various litigation claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding contingent liabilities 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from these estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 



 32 

impairment of goodwill is assessed at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test under asc 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other asc 350 for those reporting units that bypass or fail the qualitative assessment the test compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair value is determined using three valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model an income approach a marketadjusted multiple of earnings and revenues a market approach and a similar transactions method also a market approach the discounted cash flow approach relies on our estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing growth and margins with due consideration given to forecasting risk the earnings and revenue multiple approach reflects the markets expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publicly traded companies and the subject reporting units the similar transactions method considers prices paid in transactions that have recently occurred in our industry or in related industries these valuation techniques are weighted 50 40 and 10 respectively 

impairment of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is first assessed using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired this assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset for those indefinitelived assets where it is required a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology income approach which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value would be recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess 

the determination of the estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows including profit margins longterm forecasts discount rates and terminal growth rates we developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit for our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2018 we calculated the fair value for each of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangibles based on the results of these calculations and further outlined below we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

goodwill  under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 110 to 140 and terminal growth rates ranging from 30 to 45 under the guideline public company method we used an adjusted multiple ranging from 65 to 135 of projected earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda based on the market information of comparable companies additionally we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization for all reporting units except one in latin america the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 75 a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units the one reporting unit with a percentage of carrying value less than 75 exceeded its carrying value by 11 the reporting unit reported within the climate segment has approximately 190 million of goodwill at the testing date with all other assumptions and trends remaining constant for each independent variable a 05 increase in the discount rate combined with a 05 decrease in the longterm growth rate would result in an approximate 15 million impairment for this reporting unit 

other indefinitelived intangible assets   in testing our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 110 to 155 terminal growth rates of 30 and royalty rates ranging from 05 to 45 for all tradenames the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 74 with the exception of one the tradename reported within our climate segment had an excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value of approximately 19 9 in 2017 and an approximate carrying value of 15 million at december 31 2018 a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our tradenames in addition the company has three recently acquired tradenames now subject to our annual impairment test combined these tradenames have a carrying value of approximately 14 million each with an estimated fair value over carrying value of under 10 

 33 

as expected due to their recent valuation upon acquisition small variations in our estimates and assumptions could impact their fair value 

longlived assets and finitelived intangibles – longlived assets and finitelived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows can be generated impairment in the carrying value of an asset would be recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset are less than its carrying value the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined by an estimate of discounted cash flows changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to these valuations 

 the transaction price allocated to performance obligations reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from a customer to determine the transaction price variable and noncash consideration are assessed as well as whether a significant financing component exists our contracts with customers dealers and distributors include several forms of sales incentive programs variable consideration which are estimated and included in the transaction price they include but are not limited to discounts coupons and rebates where the customer does not have to provide any additional requirements to receive the discount we record an accrual contra receivable and a sales deduction for our best estimate determined using the expected value method in addition sales returns and customer disputes involving a question of quantity or price are also accounted for as variable consideration all other incentives or incentive programs where the customer is required to reach a certain sales level remain a customer for a certain period of time provide a rebate form or is subject to additional requirements are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and establishment of a liability for our best estimate determined using the expected value method we consider historical data in determining our best estimates of variable consideration these estimates are reviewed regularly for appropriateness considering also whether the estimates should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue recognition in a future period if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates of variable consideration the revisions are included in the results for the period in which they become known through a cumulative effect adjustment to revenue 

we enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple goods and services such as equipment installation and extended warranties for these arrangements each good or service is evaluated to determine whether it represents a distinct performance obligation the total transaction price is then allocated to the distinct performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling price at the inception of the arrangement if available we utilize observable prices for goods or services sold separately to similar customers in similar circumstances to determine its relative standalone selling price otherwise list prices are used if they are determined to be representative of standalone selling prices if neither of these items are available at contract inception judgment may be required and we will estimate standalone selling price based on our best estimate we recognize revenue for delivered goods or services when the delivered good or service is distinct 

 34 

control of the good or service has transferred to the customer and only customary refund or return rights related to the goods or services exist 

 the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 

 the rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan’s investment policy the types of assets held and the target asset allocation the expected longterm rate of return is determined as of each measurement date we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors 

changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the expected 2019 net periodic pension cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 72 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately 67 million a 025 rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would increase expected 2019 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by 07 million and a 10 increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the service and interest cost by approximately 04 million 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world 

many of our nonus operations have a functional currency other than the us dollar and their results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes therefore our reported results will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency our largest concentration of revenues from nonus operations as of 

 35 

december 31 2018 are in euros and chinese yuan a hypothetical 10 unfavorable change in the average exchange rate used to translate net revenues  for the year ended december 31 2018 from either euros or chinese yuanbased operations into us dollars would not have a material impact on our financial statements 

we use derivative instruments to hedge those material exposures that cannot be naturally offset the instruments utilized are viewed as risk management tools primarily involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2018  a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an unrealized loss of approximately  176 million  as compared with  583 million  at december 31 2017  these amounts when realized would be offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2018  

interest rate exposure 

our debt portfolio mainly consists of fixedrate instruments and therefore any fluctuation in market interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations

competitive conditions 

our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world due to the diversity of these products and services and the variety of markets served we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line and services they include wellestablished regional or specialized competitors as well as larger us and nonus corporations or divisions of larger companies 

the principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price quality delivery service and support technology and innovation we believe that we are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of hvac systems and services air compression systems transport temperature control products power tools and golf utility and consumer lowspeed vehicles 

distribution 

our products are distributed by a number of methods which we believe are appropriate to the type of product us sales are made through branch sales offices distributors and dealers across the country nonus sales are made through numerous subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world 

operations by geographic area 

approximately 35  of our net revenues in 2017  were derived outside the us and we sold products in more than 100 countries therefore the attendant risks of manufacturing or selling in a particular country such as currency devaluation nationalization and establishment of common markets may have an adverse impact on our nonus operations for a discussion of risks associated with our nonus operations see “risk factors – our global operations subject us to economic risks” and “risk factors – currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect our results” in item 1a and “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in item 7a additional geographic data is provided in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

customers 

we have no customer that accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues in 2017  2016  or 2015  no material part of our business is dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers therefore the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

 5 

raw materials 

we manufacture many of the components included in our products which requires us to employ a wide variety of commodities principal commodities such as steel copper and aluminum are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world in the past variability in prices for some commodities particularly steel and nonferrous metals have caused margin pressure in some of our businesses we have historically been able to adjust pricing with customers to maintain our margins however we may not always be able to offset these cost changes with price changes 

we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future there have been no commodity shortages which have had a material adverse effect on our businesses however significant changes in certain material costs may have an adverse impact on our costs and operating margins to mitigate this potential impact we enter into longterm supply contracts in order to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions 

working capital 

we manufacture products that must be readily available to meet our customers’ rapid delivery requirements therefore we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs and our customers’ requirements such working capital requirements are not however in the opinion of management materially different from those experienced by our major competitors we believe our sales and payment terms are competitive in and appropriate for the markets in which we compete 

seasonality 

demand for certain of our products and services is influenced by weather conditions for instance sales in our commercial and residential hvac businesses historically tend to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because this represents summer in the us and other northern hemisphere markets which is the peak season for sales of air conditioning systems and services therefore results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unusual weather patterns or events could negatively or positively affect certain segments of our business and impact overall results of operations 

research and development 

we engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products enhance existing product effectiveness improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate in addition we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment or acquisition we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development activities as we look to maintain and improve our competitive position 

patents and licenses 

we own numerous patents and patent applications and are licensed under others although in aggregate we consider our patents and licenses to be valuable to our operations we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single patent or license or any group of them in our opinion engineering production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our patents andor licenses 

backlog 

our approximate backlog of orders believed to be firm at december 31  was as follows 



these backlog figures are based on orders received while the major portion of our products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock orders for specialized machinery or specific customer application are submitted with extensive lead times and are often subject to revision and deferral and to a lesser extent cancellation or termination we expect to ship substantially all of the december 31 2017  backlog during 2018  

 6 

environmental matters 

we continue to be dedicated to environmental and sustainability programs to minimize the use of natural resources and reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials from our manufacturing processes and to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the environmental protection agency and similar state authorities we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future 

for a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

asbestosrelated matters 

certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries and former companies are named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in state and federal courts in many of the lawsuits a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants the vast majority of those claims allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products primarily pumps boilers and railroad brake shoes none of our existing or previouslyowned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos

 item 1a  risk factors   

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to a number of risks that could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k the risks set forth below are those we consider most significant we face other risks however that we do not currently perceive to be material which could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from our expectations you should evaluate all risks before you invest in our securities if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted in that case the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including europe china brazil middle east africa india argentina mexico and russia these activities are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

 these risks could increase our cost of doing business internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations limit our ability to sell products in certain markets and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we face significant competition in the markets that we serve and our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

the markets that we serve are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products there has been consolidation and new entrants including nontraditional competitors within our industries and there may be future consolidation and new entrants which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the competitive landscape in which we operate due to our global footprint we are competing worldwide with large companies and with smaller local operators who may have customer regulatory or economic advantages in the geographies in which they are located in addition some of our competitors may employ pricing and other strategies that are not traditional 

in addition we must develop and commercialize new products and services in a rapidly changing technological and business environment in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business the development and commercialization of new products and services require a significant investment of resources and an anticipation of the impact of new technologies and the ability to compete with others who may have superior resources we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by our current and future markets failure to develop new products and services that are accepted by these markets could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and long term credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategies 

 9 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit at interest rates and on terms that are acceptable to them could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world 

many of our nonus operations have a functional currency other than the us dollar and their results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes therefore our reported results will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 

we use derivative instruments to hedge those material exposures that cannot be naturally offset the instruments utilized are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business or the business operations of previouslyowned entities our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation contract claims or other commercial disputes product liability product defects and asbestosrelated matters that cannot be predicted with certainty moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against the total aggregate amount of losses sustained as a result of such proceedings and contingencies as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other events could affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any violations of law or improper conduct could damage our reputation and depending on the circumstances subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects financial condition results of operations cash flows and the market value of our stock 

we may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are supported by third party vendors including cloud services to manage and operate our business we are also investing in new information technology systems that are designed to continue improving our operations if these systems cease to function properly if these systems experience security breaches or disruptions or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 10 

security breaches or disruptions of our technology systems infrastructure or products could negatively impact our business and financial results 

our information technology systems and infrastructure and technology embedded in certain of our control products may be subject to cyber attacks and unauthorized security intrusions it is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period in addition hardware software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly result in security breaches or disruptions the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly changing and evolving despite having instituted security policies and business continuity plans and implementing and regularly reviewing and updating processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access the everevolving threats mean we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data our systems networks and certain of our control products may be vulnerable to system damage malicious attacks from hackers employee errors or misconduct viruses power and utility outages and other catastrophic events that could cause significant harm to our business by negatively impacting our business operations compromising the security of our proprietary information or the personally identifiable data relating to our customers employees and business partners and exposing us to litigation that could adversely affect our reputation such events could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to a cybersecurity attack or disruptions resulting from such attacks 

commodity shortages and price increases could adversely affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities particularly steel and nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in the prices of these commodities or the impact of inflationary increases could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows conversely in the event there is deflation we may experience pressure from our customers to reduce prices there can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows we do not currently use financial derivatives to hedge against this volatility while we use fixed price contracts to mitigate this exposure we expect any future hedging activity to seek to minimize nearterm volatility of the commodity prices which would not protect us from longterm commodity price increases 

some of our purchases are from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of cost effectiveness uniqueness of design or product quality if these suppliers encounter financial or operating difficulties we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

at december 31 2017  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled  59 billion  and  27 billion  respectively in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and sustained market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairments to goodwill or other indefinitelived assets any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the periods recognized 

global climate change and related regulations could negatively affect our business 

refrigerants are essential to many of our products and there is a growing awareness and concern regarding global warming potential of such materials as such national regional and international regulations and policies are being considered to curtail their use as we begin to see regulations impeding the use of the current class of widely used refrigerants we are planning for and managing transitions to sustainable solutions we have committed to increase energy efficiency and reduce our climate impact with operational and productrelated climate targets including among other initiatives i 50 percent reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions refrigerant footprint of our products for our customers by 2020 and lower global warming potential alternatives across our portfolio by 2030 ii 500 million investment in productrelated research and development from 20152020 to fund the longterm reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and iii 35 percent reduction in the greenhouse gas footprint of our office buildings manufacturing facilities and fleet by 2020 while we are committed to pursuing these sustainable solutions there can be no assurance that our commitments will be successful that our products will be accepted by the market that proposed regulation or deregulation will not have a negative competitive impact or that economic returns will match the investment that we are making in new product development 

 11 

concerns regarding global climate change have resulted in the kigali amendment to the montreal protocol pursuant to which countries have agreed to a scheduled phase down of certain high global warming potential refrigerants national regulations are expected to be set globally to reduce the use of these refrigerants these regulations could be even more restrictive than the international agreement some countries including the us have not yet ratified the amendment and there could be lower customer demand for next generation products in these countries there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty in addition the us withdrawal from the paris accord could affect our competitiveness in certain markets such regulatory uncertainty extends to future incentives for energy efficient buildings and vehicles and costs of compliance which may impact the demand for our products obsolescence of our products and our results of operations 

natural disasters or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and may not be covered by insurance 

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including hurricanes fires earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the us or in other countries in which we operate or are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our plants temporary or longterm disruption of our operations by causing business interruptions or by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for the costs that may arise from such events particularly if such events are catastrophic in nature or occur in combination the occurrence of any of these events could increase our insurance and other operating costs 

some of the markets in which we operate are cyclical and seasonal and demand for our products and services could be adversely affected by downturns in these industries 

demand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers the level of capital expenditures by our customers fluctuates based on planned expansions new builds repairs commodity prices general economic conditions availability of credit inflation interest rates market forecasts tax and regulatory developments trade policies fiscal spending and sociopolitcal factors among others 

our commercial and residential hvac businesses which collectively represent 64  of our 2017  net revenues provide products and services to a wide range of markets including significant sales to the commercial and residential construction markets weakness in either or both of these construction markets may negatively impact the demand for our products and services 

demand for our commercial and residential hvac business is also influenced by weather conditions for instance sales in our commercial and residential hvac businesses historically tend to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because in the us and other northern hemisphere markets summer is the peak season for sales of air conditioning systems and services the results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unusual weather patterns or events could negatively or positively affect our business and impact overall results of operations 

the business of many of our industrial customers particularly oil and gas companies are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns during such economic downturns customers in these industries historically have tended to delay major capital projects maintenance projects and upgrades 

decrease in the demand or our products and services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 

 12 

our business strategy includes acquiring and divesting companies product lines plants and assets entering into joint ventures and making investments that complement our existing businesses we may not identify acquisition disposition or joint venture candidates at the same rate as the past acquisitions dispositions joint ventures and investments that we identify could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition and divestiture of strategic businesses and product lines technologies and capabilities plants and assets joint ventures and investments with the potential to strengthen our industry position enhance our existing set of product and services offerings to increase productivity and efficiencies or to grow or protect revenues earnings and cash flow or to reduce costs there can be no assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable candidates in the future that we will consummate these transactions at rates similar to the past or that completed transactions will be successful strategic transactions may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows such transactions involve numerous other risks including 

 it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our business operations any acquisitions divestitures joint ventures or investments may ultimately harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as such transactions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including among others laws related to the environment and health and safety we have made and will be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations any violations of applicable laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties fines or other sanctions changes in current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services the us federal government and various states and municipalities have enacted or may enact legislation intended to deny government contracts to us companies that reincorporate outside of the us or have reincorporated outside of the us or may take other actions negatively impacting such companies if we are unable to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations interpretations of applicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 

risks relating to our past spinoff transaction 

in december 2013 we completed the spinoff of our former commercial and residential security businesses to our shareholders the spinoff pursuant to which each shareholder as of the record date for the spinoff received one ordinary share of allegion plc allegion for every three ingersollrand plc ordinary shares allegion is now an independent public company this spinoff exposed us and our shareholders to the risks described below in addition we cannot be assured that all of the anticipated benefits of the spinoff and subsequent to the spinoff will be realized 

 13 

if the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders as of the time of the distribution that are subject to us federal income tax andor allegion could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we received a ruling from the us internal revenue service irs substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution of allegion plc’s ordinary shares together with certain related transactions will qualify for taxfree treatment under sections 355 and 368a of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code with the result that we and our shareholders will not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares the irs ruling the irs ruling also provides that specified internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution will qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition we received opinions from the law firm of simpson thacher  bartlett llp substantially to the effect that specified requirements including certain requirements that the irs will not rule on necessary to obtain taxfree treatment have been satisfied such that the distribution for us federal income tax purposes and certain other matters relating to the distribution including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution will receive taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code the irs ruling and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and allegion regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters 

notwithstanding the irs ruling and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in shares or asset ownership after the distribution a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment and is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinion is based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution andor internal transactions ultimately is determined to be taxable we or allegion could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities which could cause a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

furthermore if notwithstanding receipt of the irs ruling and opinions the spinoff were determined to be a taxable transaction each shareholder subject to us federal income tax who received shares of allegion in the spinoff would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the allegion shares received that distribution would be taxable as a dividend to the extent of our thencurrent and accumulated earnings and profits any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the applicable shareholders tax basis in our ordinary shares with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain 

under the terms of the tax matters agreement between us and allegion executed in connection with the spinoff in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us or allegion the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us or allegion as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us or allegion then allegion would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or allegion as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant if allegion were to default in its obligation to us to pay such taxes we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of tax liabilities to the extent we are responsible for any liability under the tax matters agreement there could be a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

if the distribution is determined to be taxable for irish tax purposes significant irish tax liabilities may arise 

we received an opinion of irish revenue regarding the irish tax consequences of the distribution to the effect that certain reliefs and exemptions for corporate reorganizations apply in addition to obtaining the opinion from irish revenue we also received opinions from the law firm of arthur cox confirming the applicability of the relevant exemptions and reliefs to the distribution as well as received opinions from other external advisers that certain internal transactions will not trigger irish tax costs as well these opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and allegion regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the opinions irish revenue could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions do not qualify for the relevant exemptions or reliefs if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment and is not binding on irish revenue or the courts and irish revenue or the courts may not agree with the legal opinion in addition the legal opinion is based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution ultimately is determined not to fall within certain exemptions or reliefs the distribution could result in certain of our shareholders having an irish tax liability as a result of the distribution or we or allegion could incur irish tax liabilities to the extent we are responsible for any such liability under the tax matters agreement there could be a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods

risks relating to our operations and corporate structure 

our corporate structure has resulted from prior corporate reorganizations and related transactions these various transactions exposed us and our shareholders to the risks described below in addition we cannot be assured that all of the anticipated benefits of our operations and corporate structure will be realized 

changes in tax or other laws regulations or treaties including the recent enactment of the us tax cuts and jobs act changes in our status under us or nonus laws or adverse determinations by taxing or other governmental authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our operations and corporate structure could be impacted by changes in tax or other laws treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the us or nonus tax or other governmental authorities recently enacted comprehensive tax reform legislation known as the tax cuts and jobs act tcja makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code as part of the migration from a worldwide system of taxation to a modified territorial system for corporations the tcja imposes a transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of nonus subsidiaries we have taken a charge in connection with the mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings of certain of our nonus subsidiaries and we have recorded other charges and benefits set forth in greater detail in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements we are also continuing to evaluate any additional impact on the company from the tcja the full impact of the changes is not currently determinable as we are expecting future guidance to be issued by the us department of treasury andor the irs which we expect will provide better clarity regarding the interpretation and application of these rules however the new law’s substantial limitations on andor elimination of certain tax deductions and the introduction of new taxing provisions among other items may increase our overall tax burden or otherwise negatively impact the company moreover our overall tax burden may also be adversely impacted by any tax law changes implemented by other countries 

notwithstanding this change in us tax law we continue to monitor for other tax changes us and nonus related from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws regulations or interpretations thereof of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted or implemented could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations moreover the organisation for economic cooperation and development has released proposals to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting such that tax laws in countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely impact us finally the european commission has been very active in investigating whether various tax regimes or private tax rulings provided by a country to particular taxpayers may constitute state aid we cannot predict the outcome of any of these potential changes or investigations in any of the jurisdictions but if any of the above occurs and impacts us this could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

while we monitor proposals and other developments that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals or regulatory changes are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax or other laws is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding the shareholders decision to reorganize in ireland limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

while our us operations are subject to us tax we believe that a significant portion of our nonus operations are generally not subject to us tax other than withholding taxes for pretcja years the irs or a court however may not concur with our conclusions including our determination that we and a significant number of our foreign subsidiaries are not controlled foreign corporations cfc within the meaning of the us tax laws a contrary determination could also potentially cause us holders direct indirect or constructive owners of 10 or more of our stock or the voting stock of our nonus subsidiaries to include in their gross income their pro rata share of certain of our and our nonus subsidiary income for the period during which we and our nonus subsidiaries were a cfc in addition a gain or a portion of such gain realized on cfc shares sold by such shareholders may be treated as ordinary income depending on certain facts treatment of us or any of our nonus subsidiaries as a cfc for such years could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the inability to realize any anticipated tax benefits related to our operations and corporate structure could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate these examinations on their own or any subsequent litigation related to the examinations may result in additional taxes or penalties 

 15 

against us if the ultimate result of these audits differ from our original or adjusted estimates they could have a material impact on our tax provision 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities   

the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemptive rights with respect to any particular allotment of shares under irish law we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares including shares that are part of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital in addition unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders when an irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a prorata basis if we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations our ability to issue shares or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax   

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders resident in the united states will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could have an adverse impact on the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax   

dividends paid in respect of our shares will generally not be subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in ingersollrand plc 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in ingersollrand plc

 23 

the resolution reached in july 2015 covered intercompany debt and related issues for the entire period from 2002 through 2011 and includes all aspects of the dispute with the us tax court the appeals division and the examination division of the irs the resolution was subsequently reported to the congressional joint committee on taxation jct as required for its review the jct concluded its review without objection in december 2015 and the settlement was finalized with the irs in december 2015

unallocated corporate expense for the year ended december 31 2016  increased by 167 or 336 million  compared with the same period of 2015  the increase in expenses relates to higher compensation and benefit charges related to variable compensation during 2016 in addition higher restructuring charges impacted the current period 

interest expense 

interest expense  for the year ended december 31 2016  decreased by  15 million  compared with the same period of 2015  the decrease relates primarily to changes in shortterm financing arrangements and other items 

other incomeexpense net 

the components of other incomeexpense net  for the years ended december 31 are as follows 



other income expense net includes the results from activities other than normal business operations such as interest income and foreign currency gains and losses on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency in addition we include the components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and post retirement obligations other than the service cost component as a result of the adoption of asu 201707 other activity net include costs associated with trane for the settlement and defense of asbestosrelated claims insurance settlements on asbestosrelated matters and the revaluation of its liability for potential future claims amounts recorded during 2015 include a settlement with an insurance carrier in addition other activity net for the year ended december 31 2016 includes 164 million for the settlement of a lawsuit originally filed by a customer in 2012 the lawsuit related to a commercial hvac contract entered into in 2001 prior to our acquisition of trane the charge represents the settlement and related legal costs recognized during 2016 

 30 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we recognized a loss on foreign currency exchange of 362 million this loss is comprised of a 426 million pretax charge recorded in the first quarter related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets denominated in venezuelan bolivar this loss was partially offset by 64 million of foreign currency transaction gains resulting from the remeasurement of nonfunctional balance sheet positions into their functional currency 

sale of hussmann equity investment 

during 2011 we completed the sale of a controlling interest of our hussmann refrigerated display case business hussmann to a newlyformed affiliate of private equity firm clayton dubilier  rice llc cdr per the terms of the agreement cdr’s ownership interest in hussmann at the acquisition date was 60 with the remaining 40 being retained by us as a result we accounted for our interest in hussmann using the equity method of accounting 

on december 21 2015 we announced we would sell our remaining equity interest in hussmann as part of a transaction in which panasonic corporation would acquire 100 percent of hussmanns outstanding shares the transaction was completed on april 1 2016 we received net proceeds of 4225 million for our interest and recognized a gain of 3978 million  on the sale 

provision for income taxes 

the 2016 effective tax rate was 162 which is lower than the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the tax treatment of the hussmann gain the gain which is not subject to tax under the relevant local tax laws decreased the effective tax rate by 48 in addition the reduction was also driven by earnings in nonus jurisdictions which in aggregate have a lower effective tax rate revenues from nonus jurisdictions account for approximately 35 of our total revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the us at rates ranging from 0 to 38 when comparing the results of multiple reporting periods among other factors the mix of earnings between us and foreign jurisdictions can cause variability on our overall effective tax rate 

the 2015 effective tax rate was 433 which is higher than the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the 227 million charge taken to settle the irs agreement which increased our effective tax rate by 181 this effect was partially offset by a 65 million benefit from the settlement of an audit in a major tax jurisdiction less a tax charge of 52 million from a change in permanent reinvestment assertions on earnings from certain of our subsidiaries in nonus jurisdictions 

discontinued operations 

the components of discontinued operations net of tax  for the years ended december 31 are as follows 



discontinued operations are retained costs from previously sold businesses including postretirement benefits product liability and legal costs mostly asbestosrelated in addition we include costs for the settlement and defense of asbestosrelated claims insurance settlements on asbestosrelated matters and the revaluation of its liability for potential future claims for the year ended december 31 2016 ongoing costs were more than offset by asbestosrelated settlements with various insurance carriers a portion of the tax benefits expense in each period represent adjustments for certain tax matters associated with the 2013 spinoff of allegion 

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities in doing so we review and analyze our current cash on hand the number of days our sales are outstanding inventory turns capital expenditure commitments and income tax payments our cash requirements primarily consist of the following 

 

our primary sources of liquidity include cash balances on hand cash flows from operations proceeds from debt offerings commercial paper and borrowing availability under our existing credit facilities we earn a significant amount of our operating income in jurisdictions where it is deemed to be permanently reinvested our most prominent jurisdiction of operation is the us we expect existing cash and cash equivalents available to the us operations the cash generated by our us operations our committed credit lines as well as our expected ability to access the capital and debt markets will be sufficient to fund our us 

 31 

operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future in addition we expect existing nonus cash and cash equivalents and the cash generated by our nonus operations will be sufficient to fund our nonus operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 15 billion  of cash and cash equivalents on hand of which approximately 11 billion  was held by nonus subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries are generally available for use in our us operations via intercompany loans equity infusions or via distributions from direct or indirectly owned nonus subsidiaries for which we do not elect permanent reinvestment we currently have no plans to repatriate funds from subsidiaries for which we elect permanent reinvestment to fund our us operations however if we decided to repatriate such funds to fund our us operations we would be required to accrue and pay applicable taxes 

share repurchases are made from time to time in accordance with managements capital allocation strategy subject to market conditions and regulatory requirements in february 2014 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15 billion of our ordinary shares under a share repurchase program that began in april 2014 and was completed in the second quarter of 2017 

in february 2017 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15 billion of our ordinary shares under a share repurchase program upon completion of the prior share repurchase program repurchases under this program began in may 2017 and total approximately 600 million at december 31 2017 as a result we have approximately 900 million remaining under this program we repurchased approximately 10 billion of our ordinary shares during 2017 

in august 2017 we announced an increase in our quarterly share dividend from 040 to 045 per ordinary share this reflects a 125 increase that began with our september 2017 payment and a 55 increase since the beginning of 2016 in addition we incur ongoing costs associated with restructuring initiatives intended to result in improved operating performance profitability and working capital levels actions associated with these initiatives may include workforce reduction improving manufacturing productivity realignment of management structures and rationalizing certain assets we continue to be active with acquisitions during 2017 we acquired several businesses including channel acquisitions that complement existing products and services further growing our product portfolio we expect that our available cash flow committed credit lines and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to fund share repurchases the increased dividends acquisitions and ongoing restructuring actions 

liquidity 

the following table contains several key measures of our financial condition and liquidity at the periods ended december 31

 32 

december 31 2016  see note 7 and note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the terms of our longterm obligations and their related guarantees 

pension plans 

our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due we seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities our approach to asset allocation is to increase fixed income assets as the plans funded status improves we monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance in addition we monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis none of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to the volatility in the markets see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding pensions 

cash flows 

the following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended december 31 respectively for additional details please see the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements 



operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities for the year ended december 31 2017   was 15616 million  of which net income provided 16421 million  after adjusting for noncash transactions changes in other assets and liabilities  used 805 million  improvements in accounts payable were offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory balances net cash provided by continuing operating activities for the year ended december 31 2016  was 14330 million  of which net income provided 14498 million  after adjusting for noncash transactions changes in other assets and liabilities  used 168 million  improvements in accounts payable were offset by higher accounts receivable balances net cash provided by continuing operating activities for the year ended december 31 2015  was 9235 million  of which net income provided 12289 million  after adjusting for noncash transactions changes in other assets and liabilities  used 3054 million  which was primarily driven by the net cash outflow for the irs agreement of approximately 364 million and higher working capital balances 

investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities represents inflows and outflows regarding the purchase and sale of assets primary activities associated with these items include capital expenditures proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment acquisitions and divestitures during the year ended december 31 2017  net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 3747 million  the primary driver of the outflow is attributable to capital expenditures of  2213 million  in addition we acquired several businesses that complement existing products and services cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was 1576 million  during the year net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2016  was 2401 million  the primary driver of the balance is attributable to the proceeds of 4225 million received from the sale of our hussmann equity interest during the year this amount was partially offset by capital expenditures during the year during the year ended december 31 2015  net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 11929 million  the primary driver of the outflow related to the acquisition of the engineered centrifugal compression business for approximately 850 million and the acquisition of frigoblock for approximately €100 million approximately 113 million in addition capital expenditures contributed to the outflow during the year 

financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities represent inflows and outflows that account for external activities affecting equity and debt primary activities associated with these actions include paying dividends to shareholders repurchasing our own shares issuing our stock and debt transactions during the year ended december 31 2017  net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 14325 million  primary drivers of the cash outflow related to the repurchase of 118 million ordinary shares and dividends paid to ordinary shareholders during the year ended december 31 2016  net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 7269 million  primary drivers of the cash outflow related to the repurchase of 49 million ordinary shares and dividends paid to ordinary shareholders in addition we repaid our outstanding commercial paper balance during the year net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2015  was 5276 million  primary drivers of the cash outflow includes dividends paid to ordinary shareholders and the repurchase of 44 million ordinary shares 

 33 

discontinued operations 

cash flows from discontinued operations primarily represent costs associated with postretirement benefits product liability and legal costs mostly asbestosrelated from previously sold businesses net cash used in discontinued operating activities during the year ended december 31 2017  was 381 million  ongoing costs were partially offset by asbestosrelated settlements reached with various insurance carriers during the year net cash provided by discontinued operating activities for the year ended december 31 2016  was 889 million and included asbestosrelated settlements reached with various insurance carriers during the year as well as a realized gain on the sale of property related to a previously sold business these amounts more than offset ongoing costs net cash used in discontinued operating activities during the year ended december 31 2015  was 351 million and primarily related to ongoing costs 

capital resources 

based on historical performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance the cash generated from our operations our committed credit lines and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures dividends share repurchase programs upcoming debt maturities and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the foreseeable future 

capital expenditures were  2213 million   1827 million  and  2496 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively our investments continue to improve manufacturing productivity reduce costs provide environmental enhancements upgrade information technology infrastructure and security and advanced technologies for existing facilities the capital expenditure program for 2018  is estimated to be approximately 300 million including amounts approved in prior periods many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at our option without incurring substantial charges 

for financial market risk impacting the company see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

capitalization 

in addition to cash on hand and operating cash flow we maintain significant credit availability under our commercial paper program our ability to borrow at a costeffective rate under the commercial paper program is contingent upon maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating as of december 31 2017  our credit ratings were as follows 



the credit ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

our public debt does not contain financial covenants and our revolving credit lines have a debttototal capital covenant of 65 as of december 31 2017  our debttototal capital ratio was significantly beneath this limit 

 34 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment period 



 future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above 

pensions 

at december 31 2017  we had a net unfunded liability of  6791 million  which consists of noncurrent pension assets of  617 million  and current and noncurrent pension benefit liabilities of  7408 million  it is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required we currently project that we will contribute approximately  752 million  to our plans worldwide in 2018  the timing and amounts of future contributions are dependent upon the funding status of the plan which is expected to vary as a result of changes in interest rates returns on underlying assets and other factors therefore pension contributions have been excluded from the preceding table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding pensions 

postretirement benefits other than pensions 

at december 31 2017  we had postretirement benefit obligations of  5280 million  we fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a payasyougo basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations benefit payments which are net of expected plan participant contributions and medicare part d subsidy are expected to be approximately  494 million  in 2018  because benefit payments are not required to be funded in advance and the timing and amounts of future payments are dependent on the cost of benefits for retirees covered by the plan they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding postretirement benefits other than pensions 

income taxes 

at december 31 2017  we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of  1205 million  and  325 million  of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax the liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits 

contingent liabilities 

we are involved in various litigation claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding contingent liabilities 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

 35 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

 impairment of goodwill is assessed at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test under asc 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other asc 350 for those reporting units that bypass or fail the qualitative assessment the test compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair value is determined using three valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model an income approach a marketadjusted multiple of earnings and revenues a market approach and a similar transactions method also a market approach the discounted cash flow approach relies on our estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing growth and margins with due consideration given to forecasting risk the earnings and revenue multiple approach reflects the markets expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publicly traded companies and the subject reporting units the similar transactions method considers prices paid in transactions that have recently occurred in our industry or in related industries these methods are weighted 50 40 and 10 respectively 

impairment of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is first assessed using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired this assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset for those indefinitelived assets where it is required a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology income approach which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess 

the determination of the estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows including profit margins longterm forecasts discount rates and terminal growth rates we developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit 

for our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2017 we calculated the fair value for each of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangibles based on the results of these calculations we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

goodwill  under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 100 to 130 and terminal growth rates ranging from 30 to 35 under the guideline public company method we used an adjusted multiple ranging from 65 to 135 of projected earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda based on the market information of comparable companies additionally we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization for all reporting units the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 40 a 

 36 

significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units 

other indefinitelived intangible assets   in testing our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 100 to 110 terminal growth rate of 30 and royalty rates ranging from 05 to 45 for all tradenames the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 81 with the exception of a recently acquired tradename that tradename reported within our climate segment had an excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value of approximately 9 5 in 2016 and an approximate carrying value of 16 million at december 31 2017 a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our tradenames 

 we offer various sales incentive programs to our customers dealers and distributors sales incentive programs do not preclude revenue recognition but do require an accrual for the companys best estimate of expected activity examples of the sales incentives that are accrued for as a contra receivable and sales deduction at the point of sale include but are not limited to discounts ie net 30 type coupons and rebates where the customer does not have to provide any additional 

 37 

requirements to receive the discount sales returns and customer disputes involving a question of quantity or price are also accounted for as a reduction in revenue and a contra receivable at december 31 2017  and 2016 we had a customer claim accrual contra receivable of 32 million  and 37 million  respectively all other incentives or incentive programs where the customer is required to reach a certain sales level remain a customer for a certain period of time provide a rebate form or is subject to additional requirements are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and establishment of a liability at december 31 2017  and 2016 we had a sales incentive accrual of 1073 million  and 875 million  respectively each of these accruals represents the best estimate we expect to pay related to previously sold units these estimates are reviewed regularly for accuracy if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

we enter into maintenance and extended warranty contracts with customers revenue related to these services is recognized on a straightline basis over the life of the contract unless sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of providing these services is incurred on an other than straightline basis in these circumstances revenue is recognized over the contract period in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing the service 

we primarily through our climate segment provide equipment eg hvac controls integrated solutions and installation designed to customer specifications through constructiontype contracts the term of these types of contracts is typically less than one year but can be as long as three years revenues related to these contracts are recognized using the percentageofcompletion method in accordance with gaap this measure of progress toward completion utilized to recognize sales and profits is based on the proportion of actual cost incurred to date as compared to the total estimate of contract costs at completion the timing of revenue recognition often differs from the invoicing schedule to the customer with revenue recognition in advance of customer invoicing recorded to unbilled accounts receivable and invoicing in advance of revenue recognition recorded to deferred revenue at december 31 2017  all recorded receivables billed and unbilled are due within one year we reevaluate our contract estimates periodically and reflect changes in estimates in the current period using the cumulative catchup method these periodic reviews have not historically resulted in significant adjustments if estimated contract costs are in excess of contract revenues then the excess costs are accrued 

we enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple elements such as equipment installation and service revenue for multiple element arrangements each element is evaluated to determine the separate units of accounting the total arrangement consideration is then allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price at the inception of the arrangement the relative selling price is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if it exists otherwise thirdparty evidence tpe of selling price is used if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable a best estimate of the selling price is developed for that deliverable we primarily utilize vsoe to determine its relative selling price we recognize revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has standalone value to the customer the basic revenue recognition criteria have been met and only customary refund or return rights related to the delivered elements exist 

 the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 



 38 

future periods we review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends if appropriate the discount rate the rate of compensation increase and the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date 

the rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan’s investment policy the types of assets held and the target asset allocation the expected longterm rate of return is determined as of each measurement date we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors 

changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the expected 2018 net periodic pension cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 84 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately 75 million a 025 rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would decrease expected 2018 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by 08 million and a 10 increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the service and interest cost by approximately 07 million 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world 

many of our nonus operations have a functional currency other than the us dollar and their results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes therefore our reported results will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency our largest concentration of revenues from nonus operations as of december 31 2017 are in euros and chinese yuan a hypothetical 10 unfavorable change in the average exchange rate used to translate net revenues  for the year ended december 31 2017 from either euros or chinese yuanbased operations into us dollars would not have a material impact on our financial statements 

we use derivative instruments to hedge those material exposures that cannot be naturally offset the instruments utilized are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2017  a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an unrealized loss of approximately  583 million  as compared with  810 million  at december 31 2016  these amounts when realized would be offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2017  

interest rate exposure 

our debt portfolio mainly consists of fixedrate instruments and therefore any fluctuation in market interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations

products and services 

our principal products and services by business segment include the following 





these products are sold primarily under our name and under other names including american standard aro club car nexia thermo king and trane 

acquisitions 

on january 1 2015 we completed the acquisition of the assets of cameron international corporation’s centrifugal compression engineered centrifugal compression business for approximately  850 million  the acquired business manufactures centrifugal compression equipment and provides aftermarket parts and services for global industrial applications air separation gas transmission and process gas the acquisition was funded through a combination of cash on hand and debt the results of the engineered centrifugal compression business have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition and reported within our industrial segment 

 4 

on march 4 2015 we acquired 100 of the outstanding stock of frigoblock for approximately € 100 million  approximately 113 million the acquisition was funded through a combination of cash on hand and debt the acquired business manufactures and designs transport refrigeration units for trucks and trailers which it sells primarily in western europe the results of the frigoblock business have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition and reported within our climate segment 

competitive conditions 

our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world due to the diversity of these products and services and the variety of markets served we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line and services they include wellestablished regional or specialized competitors as well as larger us and nonus corporations or divisions of larger companies 

the principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price quality delivery service and support technology and innovation we believe that we are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of hvac systems and services air compression systems transport temperature control products power tools and golf utility and consumer lowspeed vehicles 

distribution 

our products are distributed by a number of methods which we believe are appropriate to the type of product us sales are made through branch sales offices distributors and dealers across the country nonus sales are made through numerous subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world 

operations by geographic area 

approximately 35  of our net revenues in 2016  were derived outside the us and we sold products in more than 100 countries therefore the attendant risks of manufacturing or selling in a particular country such as currency devaluation nationalization and establishment of common markets may have an adverse impact on our nonus operations for a discussion of risks associated with our nonus operations see “risk factors – our global operations subject us to economic risks” and “risk factors – currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect our results” in item 1a and “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in item 7a additional geographic data is provided in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

customers 

we have no customer that accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues in 2016  2015  or 2014  no material part of our business is dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers therefore the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

raw materials 

we manufacture many of the components included in our products which requires us to employ a wide variety of commodities principal commodities such as steel copper and aluminum are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world in the past variability in prices for some commodities particularly steel and nonferrous metals have caused margin pressure in some of our businesses we have historically been able to adjust pricing with customers to maintain our margins however we may not always be able to offset these cost changes with price changes 

we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future there have been no commodity shortages which have had a material adverse effect on our businesses however significant changes in certain material costs may have an adverse impact on our costs and operating margins to mitigate this potential impact we enter into longterm supply contracts in order to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions 

working capital 

we manufacture products that must be readily available to meet our customers’ rapid delivery requirements therefore we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs and our customers’ requirements such working capital requirements are not however in the opinion of management materially different from those experienced by our major competitors we believe our sales and payment terms are competitive in and appropriate for the markets in which we compete 

seasonality 

demand for certain of our products and services is influenced by weather conditions for instance sales in our commercial and residential hvac businesses historically tend to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because this 

 5 

represents summer in the us and other northern hemisphere markets which is the peak season for sales of air conditioning systems and services therefore results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unexpected cool trends or unseasonably warm trends during the summer season could negatively or positively affect certain segments of our business and impact overall results of operations 

research and development 

we engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products enhance existing product effectiveness improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate in addition we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment or acquisition we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development activities as we look to maintain and improve our competitive position 

patents and licenses 

we own numerous patents and patent applications and are licensed under others although in aggregate we consider our patents and licenses to be valuable to our operations we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single patent or license or any group of them in our opinion engineering production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our patents andor licenses 

backlog 

our approximate backlog of orders believed to be firm at december 31  was as follows 



these backlog figures are based on orders received while the major portion of our products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock orders for specialized machinery or specific customer application are submitted with extensive lead times and are often subject to revision and deferral and to a lesser extent cancellation or termination we expect to ship substantially all the december 31 2016  backlog during 2017  

environmental matters 

we continue to be dedicated to an environmental program to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process and to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the environmental protection agency and similar state authorities we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future 

for a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

asbestos related matters 

certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries are named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in state and federal courts in many of the lawsuits a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants the vast majority of those claims allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products primarily pumps boilers and railroad brake shoes none of our existing or previouslyowned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos

 item 1a  risk factors 

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to a number of risks that could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k the risks set forth below are those we consider most significant we face other risks however that we do not currently perceive to be material but could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from our expectations you should evaluate all risks before you invest in our securities if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted in that case the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including europe china brazil venezuela middle east africa india argentina mexico and russia these activities are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

 these risks could increase our cost of doing business internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations limit our ability to sell products in certain markets and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we face significant competition in the markets that we serve and our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

the markets that we serve are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products there has been consolidation and new entrants within our industries and there may be future consolidation and new entrants which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the competitive landscape in which we operate due to our global footprint we are competing worldwide with large companies and with smaller local operators who may have customer regulatory or economic advantages in the geographies in which they are located 

in addition we must develop and commercialize new products and services in a rapidly changing technological and business environment in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business the development and commercialization of new products and services require a significant investment of resources and an anticipation of the impact of new technologies and the ability to compete with others who may have superior resources we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by our current and future markets failure to develop new products and services that are accepted by these markets could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and long term credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategies 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit at interest rates and on terms that are acceptable to them could lead to 

 9 

insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world 

many of our nonus operations have a functional currency other than the us dollar and their results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes therefore our reported results will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 

we use derivative instruments to hedge those material exposures that cannot be naturally offset the instruments utilized are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business or the business operations of previouslyowned entities our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation contract claims or other commercial disputes product liability product defects and asbestosrelated matters that cannot be predicted with certainty moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against the total aggregate amount of losses sustained as a result of such proceedings and contingencies as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other events could affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any violations of law or improper conduct could damage our reputation and depending on the circumstances subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects financial condition results of operations cash flows and the market value of our stock 

we may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are supported by third party vendors including cloud services to manage and operate our business we are also investing in new information technology systems that are designed to continue improving our operations if these systems cease to function properly if these systems experience security breaches or disruptions or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 10 

security breaches or disruptions of our technology systems infrastructure or products could negatively impact our business and financial results 

our information technology systems and infrastructure and technology embedded in certain of our control products may be subject to cyber attacks and unauthorized security intrusions it is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period in addition hardware software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly result in security breaches or disruptions the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly changing and evolving despite having instituted security policies and business continuity plans and implementing and regularly reviewing and updating processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access the everevolving threats mean we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data our systems networks and certain of our control products may be vulnerable to system damage malicious attacks from hackers employee errors or misconduct viruses power and utility outages and other catastrophic events that could cause significant harm to our business by negatively impacting our business operations compromising the security of our proprietary information or the personally identifiable data relating to our customers employees and business partners and exposing us to litigation that could adversely affect our reputation such events could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to a cybersecurity attack or disruptions resulting from such attacks 

commodity shortages and price increases and higher energy prices could adversely affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities particularly steel and nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in the prices of these commodities or the impact of inflationary increases could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows conversely in the event there is deflation we may experience pressure from our customers to reduce prices there can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows we do not currently use financial derivatives to hedge against this volatility while we use fixed price contracts to mitigate this exposure we expect any future hedging activity to seek to minimize nearterm volatility of the commodity prices which would not protect us from longterm commodity price increases 

additionally we are exposed to large fluctuations in the price of petroleumbased fuel due to the instability of current market prices higher energy costs increase our operating costs and the cost of shipping our products and supplying services to customers around the world consequently sharp price increases the imposition of taxes or an interruption of supply could cause us to lose the ability to effectively manage the risk of rising fuel prices and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

at december 31 2016  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled  57 billion  and  27 billion  respectively in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and sustained market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairments to goodwill or other indefinitelived assets any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the periods recognized 

global climate change and related regulations could negatively affect our business 

refrigerants are essential to many of our products and there is a growing awareness and concern regarding global warming potential of such materials as such national regional and international regulations and policies are being considered to curtail their use as we begin to see regulations impeding the use of the current class of widely used refrigerants we are planning for and managing transitions to sustainable solutions we have committed to increase energy efficiency and reduce our climate impact with operational and productrelated climate targets including among other initiatives i 50 percent reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions refrigerant footprint of our products for our customers by 2020 and lower global warming potential alternatives across our portfolio by 2030 ii 500 million investment in productrelated research and development from 20152020 to fund the longterm reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and iii 35 percent reduction in the greenhouse gas footprint of our office buildings manufacturing facilities and fleet by 2020 while we are committed to pursuing these sustainable solutions there can be no assurance that our commitments will be successful that our products will be accepted by the market that proposed regulation or 

 11 

deregulation will not have a negative competitive impact or that economic returns will match the investment that we are making in new product development 

concerns regarding global climate change may result in more international regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate even more restrictive standards than the voluntary commitments that we have made or require such changes on a more accelerated timeframe there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty in addition there are discussions regarding potential defunding of climaterelated international agreements andor initiatives that could affect our competitiveness in certain markets such regulatory uncertainty extends to future incentives for energy efficient buildings and vehicles and costs of compliance which may impact the demand for our products obsolescence of our products and our results of operations 

in addition to the extent climate change influences weather patterns such changes could also disrupt our operations by causing business interruptions or by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs these factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks 

some of the markets in which we operate are cyclical and seasonal and demand for our products and services could be adversely affected by downturns in these industries 

demand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers the level of capital expenditures by our customers fluctuates based on planned expansions new builds repairs commodity prices general economic conditions availability of credit inflation interest rates market forecasts regulatory developments trade policies fiscal spending and sociopolitcal factors among others 

our commercial and residential hvac businesses which collectively represent 63 of our net revenues provide products and services to a wide range of markets including significant sales to the commercial and residential construction markets weakness in either or both of these construction markets may negatively impact the demand for our products and services 

demand for our commercial and residential hvac business is also influenced by weather conditions for instance sales in our commercial and residential hvac businesses historically tend to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because in the us and other northern hemisphere markets summer is the peak season for sales of air conditioning systems and services the results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unexpected cool trends or unseasonably warm trends during the summer season could negatively or positively affect our business and impact overall results of operations 

the business of many of our industrial customers particularly oil and gas companies are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns during such economic downturns customers in these industries historically have tended to delay major capital projects maintenance projects and upgrades 

decrease in the demand or our products and services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 

 12 

our business strategy includes acquiring companies entering into joint ventures and making investments that complement our existing businesses we may not identify acquisition or joint venture candidates at the same rate as the past acquisitions joint ventures and investments that we identify could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses and product lines joint ventures and investments with the potential to strengthen our industry position enhance our existing set of product and services offerings or grow revenues earnings and cash flow there can be no assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable candidates in the future that we will consummate these transactions at rates similar to the past or that completed transactions will be successful acquisitions joint ventures and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows such transactions involve numerous other risks including 

 it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our business operations any acquisitions joint ventures or investments may ultimately harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as such transactions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including among others laws related to the environment and health and safety we have made and will be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations any violations of applicable laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties fines or other sanctions changes in current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services the us federal government and various states and municipalities have enacted or may enact legislation intended to deny government contracts to us companies that reincorporate outside of the us or have reincorporated outside of the us or may take other actions negatively impacting such companies if we are unable to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations interpretations of applicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 

risks relating to our past spinoff transaction 

in december 2013 we completed the spinoff of our former commercial and residential security businesses to our shareholders the spinoff pursuant to which each shareholder as of the record date for the spinoff received one ordinary share of allegion plc allegion for every three ingersollrand plc ordinary shares allegion is now an independent public company this spinoff exposed us and our shareholders to the risks described below in addition we cannot be assured that all of the anticipated benefits of the spinoff and subsequent to the spinoff will be realized 

if the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders as of the time of the distribution that are subject to us federal income tax andor allegion could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we received a ruling from the us internal revenue service irs substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution of allegion plc’s ordinary shares together with certain related transactions will qualify for taxfree treatment under sections 355 

 13 

and 368a of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code with the result that we and our shareholders will not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares the irs ruling the irs ruling also provides that specified internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution will qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition we received opinions from the law firm of simpson thacher  bartlett llp substantially to the effect that specified requirements including certain requirements that the irs will not rule on necessary to obtain taxfree treatment have been satisfied such that the distribution for us federal income tax purposes and certain other matters relating to the distribution including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution will receive taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code the irs ruling and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and allegion regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters 

notwithstanding the irs ruling and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in shares or asset ownership after the distribution a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment and is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinion is based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution andor internal transactions ultimately is determined to be taxable we or allegion could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities which could cause a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

furthermore if notwithstanding receipt of the irs ruling and opinions the spinoff were determined to be a taxable transaction each shareholder subject to us federal income tax who received shares of allegion in the spinoff would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the allegion shares received that distribution would be taxable as a dividend to the extent of our thencurrent and accumulated earnings and profits any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the applicable shareholders tax basis in our ordinary shares with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain 

under the terms of the tax matters agreement between us and allegion executed in connection with the spinoff in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us or allegion the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us or allegion as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us or allegion then allegion would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or allegion as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant if allegion were to default in its obligation to us to pay such taxes we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of tax liabilities to the extent we are responsible for any liability under the tax matters agreement there could be a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

if the distribution is determined to be taxable for irish tax purposes significant irish tax liabilities may arise 

we received an opinion of the irish revenue regarding the irish tax consequences of the distribution to the effect that certain reliefs and exemptions for corporate reorganizations apply in addition to obtaining the opinion from irish revenue we also received opinions from the law firm of arthur cox confirming the applicability of the relevant exemptions and reliefs to the distribution as well as received opinions from other external advisers that certain internal transactions will not trigger irish tax costs as well these opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and allegion regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the opinions irish revenue could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions do not qualify for the relevant exemptions or reliefs if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment and is not binding on irish revenue or the courts and irish revenue or the courts may not agree with the legal opinion in addition the legal opinion is based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution ultimately is determined not to fall within certain exemptions or reliefs the distribution could result in certain of our shareholders having an irish tax liability as a result of the distribution or we or allegion could incur irish tax liabilities to the extent we are responsible for any such liability under the tax matters agreement there could be a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

risks relating to our operations and corporate structure 

our corporate structure has resulted from prior corporate reorganizations and related transactions including our corporate reorganization in december 2001 to become a bermuda company the bermuda reorganization and subsequent corporate reorganization in july 2009 to become an irish public limited company these various transactions exposed us and our shareholders 

 14 

to the risks described below in addition we cannot be assured that all of the anticipated benefits of our operations and corporate structure will be realized 

changes in tax or other laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under us or nonus laws or adverse determinations by taxing or other governmental authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our operations and corporate structure could be impacted by changes in tax or other laws treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the us or nonus tax or other governmental authorities from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws regulations or interpretations thereof of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted or implemented could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for instance certain us legislative proposals would broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident for us tax purposes which would significantly diminish the realization of any tax benefit related to our operations and corporate structure there are other us legislative proposals that could modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position in addition other us legislative proposals could have a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments by our us subsidiaries to our nonus affiliates which could increase our tax liability in addition there are current proposals and active discussions regarding fundamental changes to the us tax law for example repatriation of nonus earnings with respect to which we have not previously provided for us taxes moreover the organization for economic cooperation and development has released proposals to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting such that tax laws in countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely impact us finally the european commission has been very active in investigating whether various tax regimes or private tax rulings provided by a country to particular taxpayers may constitute state aid we cannot predict the outcome of any of these potential changes or investigations in any of the jurisdictions but if any of the above occurs and impacts us this could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

while we monitor proposals and other developments that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals or regulatory changes are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax or other laws is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding the ireland reorganization limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

while our us operations are subject to us tax we believe that a significant portion of our nonus operations are generally not subject to us tax other than withholding taxes the irs or a court however may not concur with our conclusions including our determination that we and a significant number of our foreign subsidiaries are not controlled foreign corporations cfc within the meaning of the us tax laws a contrary determination which could also arise through significant future acquisitions of our stock by us persons could also potentially cause us holders direct indirect or constructive owners of 10 or more of our stock or the voting stock of our nonus subsidiaries to include in their gross income their pro rata share of certain of our and our nonus subsidiary income for the period during which we and our nonus subsidiaries were a cfc in addition gain or a portion of such gain realized on cfc shares sold by such shareholders may be treated as ordinary income depending on certain facts treatment of us or any of our nonus subsidiaries as a cfc could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the inability to realize any anticipated tax benefits related to our operations and corporate structure could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities   

the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the 

 15 

company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemptive rights with respect to any particular allotment of shares under irish law we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares including shares that are part of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital in addition unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders when an irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a prorata basis if we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations our ability to issue shares or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax   

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders resident in the united states will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could have an adverse impact on the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax   

dividends paid in respect of our shares will generally not be subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in ingersollrand plc 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in ingersollrand plc

provision for income taxes 

the 2016 effective tax rate was 162 which is lower than the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the tax treatment of the hussmann gain the gain which is not subject to tax under the relevant local tax laws decreased the effective tax rate by 48 in addition the reduction was also driven by earnings in nonus jurisdictions which in aggregate have a lower effective tax rate revenues from nonus jurisdictions account for approximately 35 of our total revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the us at rates ranging from 0 to 38 when comparing the results of multiple reporting periods among other factors the mix of earnings between us and foreign jurisdictions can cause variability on our overall effective tax rate 

the 2015 effective tax rate was 433 which is higher than the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the 227 million charge taken to settle the irs agreement which increased our effective tax rate by 181 this effect was partially offset by a 65 million benefit from the settlement of an audit in a major tax jurisdiction less a tax charge of 52 million from a change in permanent reinvestment assertions on earnings from certain of our subsidiaries in nonus jurisdictions

as of december 31 2016  we had 17147 million  of cash and cash equivalents on hand of which 9804 million  was held by nonus subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries are either generally available for use in our us operations via intercompany loans or equity infusions or we intend to permanently reinvest them in our nonus operations we currently have no plans to repatriate permanently reinvested funds to fund our us operations however if we decided to repatriate such funds to our us operations we would be required to accrue and pay applicable us and nonus taxes 

in october 2016 we announced an increase in our quarterly share dividend from 032 to 040 per ordinary share this reflects a 25 increase that began with our december 2016 payment in february 2016 we increased our quarterly share dividend from 029 to 032 per ordinary share in february 2014 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15 billion of our ordinary shares under a share repurchase program that began in april 2014 share repurchases are made from time to time at the discretion of management subject to market conditions regulatory requirements and other considerations since the programs inception we have repurchased and settled 191 million  shares for  11 billion  we have approximately 417 million remaining on the authorized plan in february 2017 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15 billion of our ordinary shares under a new share repurchase program upon completion of the current share repurchase program share repurchases will be made from time to time at the discretion of management subject to market conditions regulatory requirements and other considerations we expect our available cash flow committed credit lines and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to fund the increased dividend and share repurchases 

liquidity 

the following table contains several key measures of our financial condition and liquidity at the periods ended december 31 



debt and credit facilities 

our shortterm obligations primarily consists of current maturities of longterm debt in addition we have outstanding 3430 million  of fixed rate debentures that contain a put feature that the holders may exercise on each anniversary of the issuance date if exercised we are obligated to repay in whole or in part at the holder’s option the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of the debentures held by the holder we also maintain a commercial paper program which has been used for general corporate purposes under the program the maximum aggregate amount of unsecured commercial paper notes available 

 30 

to be issued on a private placement basis is 2 billion  as of december 31 2016  we had no commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2016  for additional information regarding the terms of our shortterm obligations see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements

pension plans 

our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due we seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities our approach to asset allocation is to increase fixed income assets as the plans funded status improves we monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance 

we monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis none of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to the volatility in the markets for further details on pension plan activity see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

cash flows 

the following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended december 31 respectively for additional details please see the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements 



operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities for the year ended december 31 2016   was 14113 million  of which net income provided 14498 million  after adjusting for noncash transactions changes in assets and liabilities net  used 385 million  improvements in accounts payable were offset by higher accounts receivable balances net cash provided by continuing operating activities for the year ended december 31 2015  was 8862 million  of which net income provided 12289 million  after adjusting for noncash transactions changes in assets and liabilities net  used 3427 million  which was primarily driven by the net cash outflow for the irs agreement of approximately 364 million and higher working capital balances net cash provided by continuing operating activities for the year ended december 31 2014  was 9917 million  of which net income provided 12130 million  after adjusting for noncash transactions changes in assets and liabilities net  used 2213 million  which was primarily driven by increases in working capital amounts operating cash flow improvements are a result of improved earnings and our continued focus on working capital management 

investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities represents inflows and outflows regarding the purchase and sale of assets primary activities associated with these items include capital expenditures proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment acquisitions and divestitures during the year ended december 31 2016  net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was 2401 million  the primary driver of the balance is attributable to the proceeds of 4225 million received from the sale of our hussmann equity interest during the year this amount was partially offset by capital expenditures during the year net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2015  was 11929 million  the primary driver of the outflow related to the acquisition of the engineered centrifugal compression business for approximately 850 million and the acquisition of frigoblock for approximately €100 million approximately 113 million in addition capital expenditures contributed to the outflow during the year net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2014  was 1970 million  and primarily related to capital expenditures 

financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities represent inflows and outflows that account for external activities affecting equity and debt primary activities associated with these actions include paying dividends to shareholders repurchasing our own shares issuing 

 31 

our stock and debt transactions during the year ended december 31 2016  net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 7052 million  primary drivers of the cash outflow includes dividends paid to ordinary shareholders and the repurchase of 49 million ordinary shares in addition we repaid our outstanding commercial paper balance during the year ended december 31 2015  net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 4903 million  primary drivers of the cash outflow includes dividends paid to ordinary shareholders and the repurchase of 44 million ordinary shares during the year ended december 31 2014  net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 8595 million  primary drivers of the cash outflow includes dividends paid to ordinary shareholders and the repurchase of 230 million ordinary shares these amounts were partially offset by the net proceeds from the issuance of debt 

discontinued operations 

cash flows from discontinued operations primarily represent costs associated with postretirement benefits product liability worker’s compensation and legal costs mostly asbestosrelated from previously sold businesses net cash provided by discontinued operating activities during the year ended december 31 2016  was 889 million  and included settlements reached with various insurance carriers related to asbestos matters during the year net cash used in discontinued operating activities for the years ended december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  relate to ongoing costs from previously sold businesses 

capital resources 

based on historical performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance the cash generated from our operations our committed credit lines and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures dividends share repurchase programs upcoming debt maturities and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the foreseeable future 

capital expenditures were  1827 million   2496 million  and  2335 million  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively our investments continue to improve manufacturing productivity reduce costs provide environmental enhancements upgrade information technology infrastructure and security and advanced technologies for existing facilities the capital expenditure program for 2017  is estimated to be approximately 250 million including amounts approved in prior periods many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at our option without incurring substantial charges 

for financial market risk impacting the company see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

capitalization 

in addition to cash on hand and operating cash flow we maintain significant credit availability under our commercial paper program our ability to borrow at a costeffective rate under the commercial paper program is contingent upon maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating as of december 31 2016  our credit ratings were as follows 



the credit ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

our public debt does not contain financial covenants and our revolving credit lines have a debttototal capital covenant of 65 as of december 31 2016  our debttototal capital ratio was significantly beneath this limit 

 32 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment period 



 future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above 

pensions 

at december 31 2016  we had net obligations of  7348 million  which consist of noncurrent pension assets of  192 million  and current and noncurrent pension benefit liabilities of  7540 million  it is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required we currently project that we will contribute approximately  975 million  to our plans worldwide in 2017  the timing and amounts of future contributions are dependent upon the funding status of the plan which is expected to vary as a result of changes in interest rates returns on underlying assets and other factors therefore pension contributions have been excluded from the preceding table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

postretirement benefits other than pensions 

at december 31 2016  we had postretirement benefit obligations of  5786 million  we fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a payasyougo basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations benefit payments which are net of expected plan participant contributions and medicare part d subsidy are expected to be approximately  542 million  in 2017  because benefit payments are not required to be funded in advance and the timing and amounts of future payments are dependent on the cost of benefits for retirees covered by the plan they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income taxes 

at december 31 2016  we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of  1071 million  and  337 million  of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax the liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits 

contingent liabilities 

we are involved in various litigation claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

see note 7 and note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on matters affecting our liquidity 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that 

 33 

are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

 recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test included in us gaap for those reporting units where it is required the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a second step is performed wherein the reporting units carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value impairment exists and must be recognized 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is determined using three valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model an income approach a marketadjusted multiple of earnings and revenues a market approach and a similar transactions method also a market approach the discounted cash flow approach relies on our estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing growth and margins with due consideration given to forecasting risk the earnings and revenue multiple approach reflects the markets expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publicly traded companies and the subject reporting units the similar transactions method considers prices paid in transactions that have recently occurred in our industry or in related industries these methods are weighted 50 40 and 10 respectively 

in the second step the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit 

recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is first assessed using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired this assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset for those indefinitelived assets where it is required a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology income approach which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess 

the determination of the estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows including profit margins longterm forecasts discount rates and terminal growth rates we developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit 

 34 

for our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2016 we calculated the fair value for each of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangibles based on the results of these calculations we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

goodwill  under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 105 to 135 and terminal growth rates ranging from 30 to 35 under the guideline public company method we used an adjusted multiple ranging from 70 to 130 of projected earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda based on the market information of comparable companies additionally we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization for all reporting units the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 26 a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units 

other indefinitelived intangible assets   in testing our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 100 to 120 terminal growth rate of 30 and royalty rates ranging from 10 to 45 for all tradenames the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 46 with the exception of two recently acquired tradenames the first tradename reported within our climate segment had an excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value of approximately 5 and an approximate carrying value of 15 million at december 31 2016 the second tradename reported within our industrial segment had an excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value of approximately 4 and an approximate carrying value of 28 million at december 31 2016 a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our tradenames 



 35 

time that the price becomes fixed or determinable at the point of sale we validate that existence of an enforceable claim that requires payment within a reasonable amount of time and assess the collectability of that claim if collectability is not deemed to be reasonably assured then revenue recognition is deferred until such time that collectability becomes probable or cash is received delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer has taken title and assumed the risks and rewards of ownership service and installation revenue are recognized when earned in some instances customer acceptance provisions are included in sales arrangements to give the buyer the ability to ensure the delivered product or service meets the criteria established in the order in these instances revenue recognition is deferred until the acceptance terms specified in the arrangement are fulfilled through customer acceptance or a demonstration that established criteria have been satisfied if uncertainty exists about customer acceptance revenue is not recognized until acceptance has occurred 

we offer various sales incentive programs to our customers dealers and distributors sales incentive programs do not preclude revenue recognition but do require an accrual for the companys best estimate of expected activity examples of the sales incentives that are accrued for as a contra receivable and sales deduction at the point of sale include but are not limited to discounts ie net 30 type coupons and rebates where the customer does not have to provide any additional requirements to receive the discount sales returns and customer disputes involving a question of quantity or price are also accounted for as a reduction in revenue and a contra receivable at december 31 2016  and 2015 we had a customer claim accrual contra receivable of 37 million  and 40 million  respectively all other incentives or incentive programs where the customer is required to reach a certain sales level remain a customer for a certain period of time provide a rebate form or is subject to additional requirements are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and establishment of a liability at december 31 2016  and 2015 we had a sales incentive accrual of 875 million  and 832 million  respectively each of these accruals represents the best estimate we expect to pay related to previously sold units these estimates are reviewed regularly for accuracy if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

we enter into maintenance and extended warranty contracts with customers revenue related to these services is recognized on a straightline basis over the life of the contract unless sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of providing these services is incurred on an other than straightline basis in these circumstances revenue is recognized over the contract period in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing the service 

we primarily through our climate segment provide equipment eg hvac controls integrated solutions and installation designed to customer specifications through constructiontype contracts the term of these types of contracts is typically less than one year but can be as long as three years revenues related to these contracts are recognized using the percentageofcompletion method in accordance with gaap this measure of progress toward completion utilized to recognize sales and profits is based on the proportion of actual cost incurred to date as compared to the total estimate of contract costs at completion the timing of revenue recognition often differs from the invoicing schedule to the customer with revenue recognition in advance of customer invoicing recorded to unbilled accounts receivable and invoicing in advance of revenue recognition recorded to deferred revenue at december 31 2016  all recorded receivables billed and unbilled are due within one year we reevaluate our contract estimates periodically and reflect changes in estimates in the current period using the cumulative catchup method these periodic reviews have not historically resulted in significant adjustments if estimated contract costs are in excess of contract revenues then the excess costs are accrued 

we enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple elements such as equipment installation and service revenue for multiple element arrangements each element is evaluated to determine the separate units of accounting the total arrangement consideration is then allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price at the inception of the arrangement the relative selling price is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if it exists otherwise thirdparty evidence tpe of selling price is used if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable a best estimate of the selling price is developed for that deliverable we primarily utilize vsoe to determine its relative selling price we recognize revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has standalone value to the customer the basic revenue recognition criteria have been met and only customary refund or return rights related to the delivered elements exist 

 we have certain deferred tax assets in brazil primarily comprised of net operating loss carryfowards with a tax effected value of approximately 32 million at december 31 2016 the operating results of this business have experienced sharp 

 36 

declines in 2016 and 2015 due to market slowdowns in brazil we concluded that these deferred tax assets which have an indefinite life did not require a valuation allowance as of december 31 2016 due to forecasted profitability and tobe implemented tax planning actions however further deterioration in operating results in this business may require us to recognize a valuation allowance in the future 

the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 

 the rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan’s investment policy the types of assets held and the target asset allocation the expected longterm rate of return is determined as of each measurement date we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors 

changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the expected 2017 net periodic pension cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 77 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately 69 million a 025 rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would decrease expected 2017 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by 09 million and a 10 increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the service and interest cost by approximately 07 million 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world 

many of our nonus operations have a functional currency other than the us dollar and their results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes therefore our reported results will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency our largest concentration of revenues from nonus operations as of december 31 2016 are in euros and chinese yuan a hypothetical 10 unfavorable change in the average exchange rate used to translate net revenues as of december 31 2016 from either euros or chinese yuanbased operations into us dollars would not have a material impact on our financial statements 

we use derivative instruments to hedge those material exposures that cannot be naturally offset the instruments utilized are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the 

 37 

risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2016  a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an unrealized loss of approximately  810 million  as compared with  645 million  at december 31 2015  these amounts when realized would be offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2016  

interest rate exposure 

our debt portfolio mainly consists of fixedrate instruments and therefore any fluctuation in market interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations

discontinued operations 

on december 1 2013 we completed the separation of its commercial and residential security businesses by distributing the related ordinary shares of allegion on a pro rata basis to our shareholders of record as of november 22 2013 after the distribution date allegion became an independent publicly traded company the results of the commercial and residential security businesses prior to the spinoff are presented as a discontinued operation on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows for all periods presented 

competitive conditions 

our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world due to the diversity of these products and services and the variety of markets served we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line and services they include wellestablished regional or specialized competitors as well as larger us and nonus corporations or divisions of larger companies 

the principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price quality delivery service and support technology and innovation we believe that we are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of hvac systems and services air compression systems transport temperature control products power tools and golf and utility vehicles 

distribution 

our products are distributed by a number of methods which we believe are appropriate to the type of product us sales are made through branch sales offices distributors and dealers across the country nonus sales are made through numerous subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world 

customers 

we have no customer that accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues in 2015  2014  or 2013  no material part of our business is dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers therefore the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

raw materials 

we manufacture many of the components included in our products which requires us to employ a wide variety of commodities principal commodities such as steel copper and aluminum are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world in the past variability in prices for some commodities particularly steel and nonferrous metals have caused pricing pressures in some of our businesses we have historically been able to adjust pricing with customers to maintain our margins however we may not always be able to offset these cost changes with price changes 

we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future there have been no commodity shortages which have had a material adverse effect on our businesses however significant changes in certain material costs may have an adverse impact on our costs and operating margins to mitigate this potential impact we enter into longterm supply contracts in order to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions 

working capital 

we manufacture products that must be readily available to meet our customers’ rapid delivery requirements therefore we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs and our customers’ requirements such working capital requirements are not however in the opinion of management materially different from those experienced by our major competitors we believe our sales and payment terms are competitive in and appropriate for the markets in which we compete 

seasonality 

demand for certain of our products and services is influenced by weather conditions for instance tranes sales have historically tended to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because this represents summer in the us and other northern hemisphere markets which is the peak season for sales of air conditioning systems and services therefore results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unexpected cool trends or unseasonably warm trends during the summer season could negatively or positively affect certain segments of our business and impact overall results of operations

research and development 

we engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products enhance existing product effectiveness improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate in addition we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment or acquisition we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development activities as we look to maintain and improve our competitive position 

patents and licenses 

we own numerous patents and patent applications and are licensed under others although in aggregate we consider our patents and licenses to be valuable to our operations we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single patent or license or any group of them in our opinion engineering production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our patents andor licenses 

operations by geographic area 

approximately 38  of our net revenues in 2015  were derived outside the us and we sold products in more than 100 countries therefore the attendant risks of manufacturing or selling in a particular country such as currency devaluation nationalization and establishment of common markets may have an adverse impact on our nonus operations for a discussion of risks associated with our nonus operations see “risk factors – our global operations subject us to economic risks” and “risk factors – currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect our results” in item 1a and “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in item 7a additional geographic data is provided in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

backlog 

our approximate backlog of orders believed to be firm at december 31  was as follows 



these backlog figures are based on orders received while the major portion of our products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock orders for specialized machinery or specific customer application are submitted with extensive lead times and are often subject to revision and deferral and to a lesser extent cancellation or termination we expect to ship substantially all the december 31 2015  backlog during 2016  

environmental matters 

we continue to be dedicated to an environmental program to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process and to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the environmental protection agency and similar state authorities we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future 

for a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements

asbestos related matters 

certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries are named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in state and federal courts in virtually all of the suits a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants the vast majority of those claims allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products primarily pumps boilers and railroad brake shoes none of our existing or previouslyowned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos

 item 1a  risk factors 

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to a number of risks that could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k the risks set forth below are those we consider most significant we face other risks however that we do not currently perceive to be material but could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from our expectations you should evaluate all risks before you invest in our securities if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted in that case the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including europe china brazil venezuela africa india argentina mexico and russia these activities are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

 these risks could increase our cost of doing business internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations limit our ability to sell products in certain markets and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we face significant competition in the markets that we serve and our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

the markets that we serve are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products there has been consolidation and new entrants within our industries and there may be future consolidation and new entrants which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the competitive landscape in which we operate due to our global footprint we are competing worldwide with large companies and with smaller local operators who may have customer regulatory or economic advantages in the geographies in which they are located 

in addition we must develop and commercialize new products and services in a rapidly changing technological and business environment in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business the development and commercialization of new products and services require a significant investment of resources and an anticipation of the impact of new technologies and the ability to compete with others who may have superior resources we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by our current and future markets failure to develop new products and services that are accepted by these markets could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and long term credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategies 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers

currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world 

many of our nonus operations have a functional currency other than the us dollar and their results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes therefore our reported results will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 

we use derivative instruments to hedge those material exposures that cannot be naturally offset the instruments utilized are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business or the business operations of previouslyowned entities our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation product liability and asbestosrelated matters that cannot be predicted with certainty moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against the total aggregate amount of losses sustained as a result of such proceedings and contingencies as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other events could affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any violations of law or improper conduct could damage our reputation and depending on the circumstances subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects financial condition results of operations cash flows and the market value of our stock 

we may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are supported by third party vendors to manage and operate our business we are also investing in new information technology systems that are designed to continue improving our operations if these systems cease to function properly if these systems experience security breaches or disruptions or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

security breaches or disruptions of our technology systems infrastructure or products could negatively impact our business and financial results 

our information technology systems and infrastructure and technology embedded in certain of our control products may be subject to cyber attacks and unauthorized security intrusions it is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period in addition hardware software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly result in security breaches or disruptions the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly changing and evolving despite having instituted security policies and business continuity plans and implementing and regularly reviewing and updating processes and procedures 

 10 

to protect against unauthorized access the everevolving threats mean we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data our systems networks and certain of our control products may be vulnerable to system damage malicious attacks from hackers employee errors or misconduct viruses power and utility outages and other catastrophic events that could cause significant harm to our business by negatively impacting our business operations compromising the security of our proprietary information or the personally identifiable data relating to our customers employees and business partners and exposing us to litigation that could adversely affect our reputation such events could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to a cybersecurity attack or disruptions resulting from such attacks 

commodity shortages and price increases and higher energy prices could adversely affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities particularly steel and nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in the prices of these commodities or the impact of inflationary increases could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows conversely in the event there is deflation we may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices there can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce its costs through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows we do not currently use financial derivatives to hedge against this volatility while we use fixed price contracts to mitigate this exposure we expect any future hedging activity to seek to minimize nearterm volatility of the commodity prices which would not protect us from longterm commodity price increases 

additionally we are exposed to large fluctuations in the price of petroleumbased fuel due to the instability of current market prices higher energy costs increase our operating costs and the cost of shipping our products and supplying services to customers around the world consequently sharp price increases the imposition of taxes or an interruption of supply could cause us to lose the ability to effectively manage the risk of rising fuel prices and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

at december 31 2015  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled  57 billion  and  27 billion  respectively in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and sustained market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairments to goodwill or other indefinitelived assets any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the periods recognized 

changes in weather patterns and seasonal fluctuations may adversely affect certain segments of our business and impact overall results of operations 

demand for certain segments of our products and services is influenced by weather conditions for instance tranes sales have historically tended to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because in the us and other northern hemisphere markets summer is the peak season for sales of air conditioning systems and services therefore results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unexpected cool trends or unseasonably warm trends during the summer season could negatively or positively affect certain segments of our business and impact overall results of operations 

 11 

global climate change and related regulations could negatively affect our business 

refrigerants are essential to many of our products and there is a growing awareness and concern regarding global warming potential of such materials as such national regional and international regulations and policies are being considered to curtail their use as we begin to see regulations impeding the use of the current class of widely used refrigerants we are planning for and managing transitions to sustainable solutions we have committed to increase energy efficiency and reduce our climate impact with operational and productrelated climate targets including among other initiatives i 50 percent reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions of our products for customers by 2020 and lower global warming potential alternatives across our portfolio by 2030 ii 500 million investment in productrelated research and development from 20152020 to fund the longterm reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and iii 35 percent reduction in the greenhouse gas footprint of our office buildings manufacturing facilities and fleet by 2020 while we are committed to pursuing these sustainable solutions there can be no assurance that our commitments will be successful that our products will be accepted by the market or that economic returns will match the investment that we are making in new product development 

concerns regarding global climate change may result in more international regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate even more restrictive standards than the voluntary commitments that we have made or require such changes on a more accelerated timeframe there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty such regulatory uncertainty extends to future incentives for energy efficient buildings and vehicles and costs of compliance which may impact the demand for our products obsolescence of our products and our results of operations 

in addition to the extent climate change influences weather patterns such changes could also disrupt our operations by causing business interruptions or by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs these factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks 

weakness in the commercial and residential construction markets may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

our commercial and residential hvac businesses which collectively represent 61 of our net revenues provide products and services to a wide range of markets including significant sales to the commercial and residential construction markets weakness in either or both of these construction markets may negatively impact the demand for our products and services decrease in the demand for our products and services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 

 12 

our business strategy includes acquiring companies entering into joint ventures and making investments that complement our existing businesses we may not identify acquisition or joint venture candidates at the same rate as the past acquisitions joint ventures and investments that we identify could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses and product lines joint ventures and investments with the potential to strengthen our industry position enhance our existing set of product and services offerings or grow revenues earnings and cash flow there can be no assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable candidates in the future that we will consummate these transactions at rates similar to the past or that completed transactions will be successful acquisitions joint ventures and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows such transactions involve numerous other risks including 

 it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our business operations any acquisitions joint ventures or investments may ultimately harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as such transactions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including among others laws related to the environment and health and safety we have made and will be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations any violations of applicable laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties fines or other sanctions changes in current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services the us federal government and various states and municipalities have enacted or may enact legislation intended to deny government contracts to us companies that reincorporate outside of the us or have reincorporated outside of the us or may take other actions negatively impacting such companies if we are unable to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations interpretations of applicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 

risks relating to our past spinoff transaction 

in december 2013 we completed the spinoff of our former commercial and residential security businesses to our shareholders the spinoff pursuant to which each shareholder as of the record date for the spinoff received one ordinary share of allegion plc allegion for every three ingersollrand plc ordinary shares allegion is now an independent public company this spinoff exposed us and our shareholders to the risks described below in addition we cannot be assured that all of the anticipated benefits of the spinoff and subsequent to the spinoff will be realized 

if the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders as of the time of the distribution that are subject to us federal income tax andor allegion could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we received a ruling from the us internal revenue service the “irs” substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution of allegion plc’s ordinary shares together with certain related transactions will qualify for taxfree treatment under 

 13 

sections 355 and 368a of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” with the result that we and our shareholders will not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares the “irs ruling” the irs ruling also provides that specified internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution will qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition we received opinions from the law firm of simpson thacher  bartlett llp substantially to the effect that specified requirements including certain requirements that the irs will not rule on necessary to obtain taxfree treatment have been satisfied such that the distribution for us federal income tax purposes and certain other matters relating to the distribution including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution will receive taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code the irs ruling and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and allegion regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters 

notwithstanding the irs ruling and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in shares or asset ownership after the distribution a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment and is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinion is based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution andor internal transactions ultimately is determined to be taxable we or allegion could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities which could cause a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

furthermore if notwithstanding receipt of the irs ruling and opinions the spinoff were determined to be a taxable transaction each shareholder subject to us federal income tax who received shares of allegion in the spinoff would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the allegion shares received that distribution would be taxable as a dividend to the extent of our thencurrent and accumulated earnings and profits any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the applicable shareholders tax basis in our ordinary shares with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain 

under the terms of the tax matters agreement between us and allegion executed in connection with the spinoff in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us or allegion the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us or allegion as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us or allegion then allegion would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or allegion as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant if allegion were to default in its obligation to us to pay such taxes we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of tax liabilities to the extent we are responsible for any liability under the tax matters agreement there could be a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

if the distribution is determined to be taxable for irish tax purposes significant irish tax liabilities may arise 

we received an opinion of the irish revenue regarding the irish tax consequences of the distribution to the effect that certain reliefs and exemptions for corporate reorganizations apply in addition to obtaining the opinion from irish revenue we also received opinions from the law firm of arthur cox confirming the applicability of the relevant exemptions and reliefs to the distribution as well as received opinions from other external advisers that certain internal transactions will not trigger irish tax costs as well these opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and allegion regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the opinions irish revenue could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions do not qualify for the relevant exemptions or reliefs if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment and is not binding on irish revenue or the courts and irish revenue or the courts may not agree with the legal opinion in addition the legal opinion is based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution ultimately is determined not to fall within certain exemptions or reliefs the distribution could result in certain of our shareholders having an irish tax liability as a result of the distribution or we or allegion could incur irish tax liabilities to the extent we are responsible for any such liability under the tax matters agreement there could be a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

risks relating to our past reorganizations   

we effected a corporate reorganization in december 2001 to become a bermuda company the bermuda reorganization and a subsequent corporate reorganization in july 2009 to become an irish public limited company these reorganizations exposed us and our shareholders to the risks described below in addition we cannot be assured that all of the anticipated benefits of the reorganizations will be realized 

 14 

changes in tax or other laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under us or nonus laws or adverse determinations by taxing or other governmental authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our reorganizations could be impacted by changes in tax or other laws treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the us or nonus tax or other governmental authorities from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws regulations or interpretations thereof of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted or implemented could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for instance certain us legislative proposals would broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident for us tax purposes which would significantly diminish the realization of any tax benefit related to our reorganizations there are other us legislative proposals that could modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position in addition other us legislative proposals could have a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments by our us subsidiaries to our nonus affiliates which could increase our tax liability moreover the organization for economic cooperation and development has released proposals to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting such that tax laws in countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely impact us we cannot predict the outcome of any of these potential changes in any jurisdiction 

while we monitor proposals and other developments that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals or regulatory changes are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax or other laws is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding the ireland reorganization limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

while our us operations are subject to us tax we believe that a significant portion of our nonus operations are generally not subject to us tax other than withholding taxes the irs or a court however may not concur with our conclusions including our determination that we and a significant number of our foreign subsidiaries are not controlled foreign corporations cfc within the meaning of the us tax laws a contrary determination which could also arise through significant future acquisitions of our stock by us persons could also potentially cause us holders direct indirect or constructive owners of 10 or more of our stock or the voting stock of our nonus subsidiaries to include in their gross income their pro rata share of certain of our and our nonus subsidiary income for the period during which we and our nonus subsidiaries were a cfc in addition gain or a portion of such gain realized on cfc shares sold by such shareholders may be treated as ordinary income depending on certain facts treatment of us or any of our nonus subsidiaries as a cfc could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the inability to realize any anticipated tax benefits related to our reorganizations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities   

the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemptive rights with respect to any particular allotment of shares under irish law we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares including shares that are part of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital in addition unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders when an irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders it is required first to offer those 

 15

we are a global corporation with worldwide operations as a global business our operations are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic factors as well as political factors wherever we operate or do business our geographic and industry diversity and the breadth of our product and services portfolios have helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results 

given the broad range of products manufactured and geographic markets served management uses a variety of factors to predict the outlook for the company we monitor key competitors and customers in order to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future we regularly perform detailed evaluations of the different market segments we are serving to proactively detect trends and to adapt our strategies accordingly in addition we believe our order rates are indicative of future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance in those industry segments where we are a capital equipment provider revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy 

current economic conditions remain challenging across each of the segments in which we participate residential and commercial new construction has seen moderate growth in the united states which is positively impacting the results of our heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac businesses nonresidential new construction continues to grow slowly in europe and asia in addition hvac equipment replacement and aftermarket continue to experience steady growth however we have seen slower worldwide industrial equipment and aftermarket activity and economic pressure in asia and latin america as economic conditions stabilize we expect moderate growth in worldwide construction markets and flat to slow growth in industrial markets along with benefits from continued productivity programs

venezuela currency devaluation 

we have one subsidiary with operations in venezuela due to the historical designation of venezuela as a highly inflationary economy the us dollar is the functional currency for this subsidiary from february 2013 to march 2015 we utilized the official exchange rate obtained through the national center of foreign trade cencoex of 63  bolivars to the us dollar to translate the venezuela subsidiary financial statements 

in january 2014 the venezuelan government significantly expanded the use of the supplementary foreign currency administration system sicad i exchange market and created a third exchange market called sicad ii in january 2015 the venezuelan government clarified the priority imports for the cencoex exchange and our products were not listed as a priority in february 2015 the venezuelan government announced a new exchange market called the marginal currency system simadi which replaced the sicad ii exchange and allows for trading based on supply and demand these markets have exchange rates significantly less favorable than the cencoex rate 

in light of the developments described above and the continued deterioration in the economic conditions of venezuela in connection with our preparation of the first quarter 2015 financial statements we utilized the simadi rate of 19295  bolivars to us dollar to translate the financial position of our venezuelan subsidiary as of march 31 2015 as a result we recorded a pretax charge of  426 million  within other incomeexpense net during the first quarter of 2015 to remeasure the net monetary assets at march 

 24 

31 2015 our remaining net assets denominated in venezuelan bolivar are nominal and continue be measured in us dollars using the simadi rate through december 31 2015

segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for performance reviews compensation and resource allocation for these reasons we believe that segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss we may exclude certain charges or gains from operating income to arrive at a segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base our operating decisions we define segment operating margin as segment operating income as a percentage of net revenues

for additional information regarding the terms of our shortterm and longterm obligations and their related guarantees see notes 7 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

pension plans 

our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due we seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities we use a dynamic approach to asset allocation whereby a plans allocation to fixed income assets increases as the plans funded status improves we monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance 

we monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis none of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to the volatility in the markets for further details on pension plan activity see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

cash flows 

the following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended december 31 respectively for additional details please see the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was  8862 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared with  9917 million  in 2014  the change in operating activities is primarily related to the net cash outflow for the irs settlement previously mentioned of approximately  364 million  along with the change in net working capital 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was  9917 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared with  7988 million  in 2013  operating cash flows for 2014 reflect improved earnings from continuing operations partially offset by rising working capital in 2014 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was  11929 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared with  1970 million  in 2014  the change in investing activities is primarily attributable to the previously mentioned acquisition of the engineered centrifugal compression business in january 2015 for approximately 850 million and the acquisition of frigoblock in march 2015 for approximately €100 million approximately 113 million 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was  1970 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared with  2132 million  in 2013  the change in investing activities is primarily attributable to 303 million cash dividend received from equity investments during the year ended december 31 2014 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended december 31 2015  was  4903 million  compared with  8595 million  in 2014  the change in financing activities is primarily driven by the company repurchasing 230 million shares for approximately 14 billion during the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the company repurchasing 44 million shares for approximately 2501 million during the year ended december 31 2015  

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended december 31 2014  was  8595 million  compared with net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations of  3541 million  in 2013  the change in financing activities is primarily related to a transfer of 12742 million from allegion in connection with the spinoff in 2013

announced sale of hussmann minority interest 

on december 21 2015 we announced we will sell our remaining equity interest in hussmann parent inc “hussmann” as part of a transaction in which panasonic corporation will acquire 100 percent of hussmanns shares we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately  425 million  the transaction is anticipated to close in the first half of 2016 subject to customary approvals and closing conditions and has no impact on the results of our operations in 2015 

capital resources 

based on historical performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance the cash generated from our operations our committed credit lines and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures dividends share repurchase programs upcoming debt maturities and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the foreseeable future 

capital expenditures were  2496 million   2335 million  and  2422 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively our investments continue to improve manufacturing productivity reduce costs and provide environmental enhancements and advanced technologies for existing facilities the capital expenditure program for 2016  is estimated to be approximately 244 million including amounts approved in prior periods many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at our option without incurring substantial charges 

for financial market risk impacting the company see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

capitalization 

in addition to cash on hand and operating cash flow we maintain significant credit availability under our commercial paper program our ability to borrow at a costeffective rate under the commercial paper program is contingent upon maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating as of december 31 2015  our credit ratings were as follows 



the credit ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

our public debt does not contain financial covenants and our revolving credit lines have a debttototal capital covenant of 65 as of december 31 2015  our debttototal capital ratio was significantly beneath this limit 

 35 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment periods 



 includes 3430 million of debt redeemable at the option of the holder the scheduled maturities of these bonds range between 2027 and 2028 see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 includes nominal amount related to interest of shortterm debt 

future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above 

pensions 

at december 31 2015  we had net obligations of  7518 million  which consist of noncurrent pension assets of  27 million  and current and noncurrent pension benefit liabilities of  7545 million  it is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required we currently project that we will contribute approximately  592 million  to our plans worldwide in 2016  the timing and amounts of future contributions are dependent upon the funding status of the plan which is expected to vary as a result of changes in interest rates returns on underlying assets and other factors therefore pension contributions have been excluded from the preceding table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

postretirement benefits other than pensions 

at december 31 2015  we had postretirement benefit obligations of  6241 million  we fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a payasyougo basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations benefit payments which are net of expected plan participant contributions and medicare part d subsidy are expected to be approximately  563 million  in 2016  because benefit payments are not required to be funded in advance and the timing and amounts of future payments for are dependent on the cost of benefits for retirees covered by the plan they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income taxes 

at december 31 2015  we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of  1749 million  and  555 million  of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax the liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits 

contingent liabilities 

we are involved in various litigations claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

see note 7 and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on matters affecting our liquidity 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

 36 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

 recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test included in us gaap for those reporting units where it is required the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a second step is performed wherein the reporting units carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value impairment exists and must be recognized 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is determined using three valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model an income approach a marketadjusted multiple of earnings and revenues a market approach and a similar transactions method also a market approach the discounted cash flow approach relies on our estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing growth and margins with due consideration given to forecasting risk the earnings and revenue multiple approach reflects the markets expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publicly traded companies and the subject reporting units the similar transactions method considers prices paid in transactions that have recently occurred in our industry or in related industries these methods are weighted 50 40 and 10 respectively 

in step 2 the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit 

recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is first assessed using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired this assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset for those indefinitelived assets where it is required a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology income approach which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess 

the determination of the estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows including profit margins longterm forecasts discount rates and terminal growth rates we developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit 

 37 

for our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2015 we calculated the fair value for each of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangibles based on the results of these calculations we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

goodwill  under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 110 to 140 and terminal growth rates ranging from 30 to 35 under the guideline company method we used an adjusted multiple ranging from 70 to 110 of projected earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda based on the market information of comparable companies additionally we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization 

for all reporting units the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 37 a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units 

other indefinitelived intangible assets   in testing our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 108 to 125 terminal growth rate of 30 and royalty rates ranging from 10 to 45 for all tradenames the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 24 with the exception of one tradename with a carrying value of approximately 28 million as december 31 2015 which had an excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value of approximately 7 

a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our tradenames 

  38 

the defined terms and conditions allow variability in all or a component of the price revenue is not recognized until such time that the price becomes fixed or determinable at the point of sale we validate that existence of an enforceable claim that requires payment within a reasonable amount of time and assess the collectability of that claim if collectability is not deemed to be reasonably assured then revenue recognition is deferred until such time that collectability becomes probable or cash is received delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer has taken title and assumed the risks and rewards of ownership service and installation revenue are recognized when earned in some instances customer acceptance provisions are included in sales arrangements to give the buyer the ability to ensure the delivered product or service meets the criteria established in the order in these instances revenue recognition is deferred until the acceptance terms specified in the arrangement are fulfilled through customer acceptance or a demonstration that established criteria have been satisfied if uncertainty exists about customer acceptance revenue is not recognized until acceptance has occurred 

we offer various sales incentive programs to our customers dealers and distributors sales incentive programs do not preclude revenue recognition but do require an accrual for the companys best estimate of expected activity examples of the sales incentives that are accrued for as a contra receivable and sales deduction at the point of sale include but are not limited to discounts ie net 30 type coupons and rebates where the customer does not have to provide any additional requirements to receive the discount sales returns and customer disputes involving a question of quantity or price are also accounted for as a reduction in revenue and a contra receivable at december 31 2015  and 2014 we had a customer claim accrual contra receivable of 40 million  and 47 million  respectively all other incentives or incentive programs where the customer is required to reach a certain sales level remain a customer for a certain period of time provide a rebate form or is subject to additional requirements are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and establishment of a liability at december 31 2015  and 2014 we had a sales incentive accrual of 832 million  and 734 million  respectively each of these accruals represents the best estimate we expect to pay related to previously sold units these estimates are reviewed regularly for accuracy if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

we enter into maintenance and extended warranty contracts with customers revenue related to these services is recognized on a straightline basis over the life of the contract unless sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of providing these services is incurred on an other than straightline basis in these circumstances revenue is recognized over the contract period in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing the service 

we primarily through our climate segment provides equipment eg hvac controls integrated solutions and installation designed to customer specifications through constructiontype contracts the term of these types of contracts is typically less than one year but can be as long as three years revenues related to these contracts are recognized using the percentageofcompletion method in accordance with gaap this measure of progress toward completion utilized to recognize sales and profits is based on the proportion of actual cost incurred to date as compared to the total estimate of contract costs at completion the timing of revenue recognition often differs from the invoicing schedule to the customer with revenue recognition in advance of customer invoicing recorded to unbilled accounts receivable and invoicing in advance of revenue recognition recorded to deferred revenue at december 31 2015  all recorded receivables billed and unbilled are due within one year we reevaluates our contract estimates periodically and reflects changes in estimates in the current period using the cumulative catchup method these periodic reviews have not historically resulted in significant adjustments if estimated contract costs are in excess of contract revenues then the excess costs are accrued 

we enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple elements such as equipment installation and service revenue for multiple element arrangements each element is evaluated to determine the separate units of accounting the total arrangement consideration is then allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price at the inception of the arrangement the relative selling price is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if it exists otherwise thirdparty evidence tpe of selling price is used if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable a best estimate of the selling price is developed for that deliverable we primarily utilizes vsoe to determine its relative selling price we recognize revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has standalone value to the customer the basic revenue recognition criteria have been met and only customary refund or return rights related to the delivered elements exist 

  39 

the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 

 at december 31 2015 we refined the methodology used to calculate service and interest costs for both pension and other postretirement benefits this refinement will result in the recognition of different costs in future periods as compared to the historical approach historically we estimated service and interest costs utilizing a weightedaverage discount rate calculated from spot rates selected along hypothetical yield curves based on corporate bonds rated aa quality beginning with the measurement of the december 31 2015 benefit obligations we refined the measurement approach to utilize multiple specific spot rates along the same hypothetical yield curve that correlate with the timing of the relevant projected cash flows our intent with this refinement is to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs the change did not have an impact on the measurement of the december 31 2015 benefit obligations however we estimate the impact on 2016 net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs to be a reduction of 220 million and 58 million respectively we concluded that this refinement is a change in accounting estimate 

the rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan’s investment policy the types of assets held and the target asset allocation the expected longterm rate of return is determined as of each measurement date we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors 

changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the expected 2016 net periodic pension cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 79 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately 67 million a 025 rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would decrease expected 2016 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by 10 million and a 10 increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the service and interest cost by approximately 08 million 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world 

many of our nonus operations have a functional currency other than the us dollar and their results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes therefore our reported results will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening 

 40 

of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency our largest concentration of revenues from nonus operations as of december 31 2015 are in euros and chinese yuan a hypothetical 10 unfavorable change in the average exchange rate used to translate net revenues as of december 31 2015 from either euros or chinese yuanbased operations into us dollars would not have a material impact on our financial statements 

we use derivative instruments to hedge those material exposures that cannot be naturally offset the instruments utilized are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2015  a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an unrealized loss of approximately  645 million  as compared with  442 million  at december 31 2014  these amounts when realized would be offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2015  

interest rate exposure 

our debt portfolio mainly consists of fixedrate instruments and therefore any fluctuation in market interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations

products and services 

our principal products and services by business segment include the following 





these products are sold primarily under our name and under other names including american standard aro club car thermo king and trane 

competitive conditions 

our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world due to the diversity of these products and services and the variety of markets served we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line and services they include wellestablished regional or specialized competitors as well as larger us and nonus corporations or divisions of larger companies 

the principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price quality delivery service and support technology and innovation we believe that we are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of hvac systems and services air compression systems transport temperature control products air tools and golf and utility vehicles 

distribution 

our products are distributed by a number of methods which we believe are appropriate to the type of product us sales are made through branch sales offices distributors and dealers across the country nonus sales are made through numerous subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world 

 4 

customers 

we have no customer that accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues in 2014  2013  or 2012  no material part of our business is dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers therefore the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

raw materials 

we manufacture many of the components included in our products which requires us to employ a wide variety of commodities principal commodities such as steel copper and aluminum are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world in the past variability in prices for some commodities particularly steel and nonferrous metals have caused pricing pressures in some of our businesses we have historically been able adjust pricing with customers to maintain our margins however we may not always be able to offset these cost changes with price changes 

we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future there have been no commodity shortages which have had a material adverse effect on our businesses however significant changes in certain material costs may have an adverse impact on our costs and operating margins to mitigate this potential impact we enter into longterm supply contracts in order to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions 

working capital 

we manufacture products that must be readily available to meet our customers’ rapid delivery requirements therefore we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs and our customers’ requirements such working capital requirements are not however in the opinion of management materially different from those experienced by our major competitors we believe our sales and payment terms are competitive in and appropriate for the markets in which we compete 

seasonality 

demand for certain of our products and services is influenced by weather conditions for instance tranes sales have historically tended to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because this represents summer in the us and other northern hemisphere markets which is the peak season for sales of air conditioning systems and services therefore results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unexpected cool trends or unseasonably warm trends during the summer season could negatively or positively affect certain segments of our business and impact overall results of operations 

research and development 

we engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products enhance existing product effectiveness improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate in addition we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment or acquisition we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development activities as we look to maintain and improve our competitive position research and development expenditures were approximately  2123 million  in 2014   2182 million  in 2013  and  2354 million  in 2012  

patents and licenses 

we own numerous patents and patent applications and are licensed under others although in aggregate we consider our patents and licenses to be valuable to our operations we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single patent or license or any group of them in our opinion engineering production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our patents andor licenses 

operations by geographic area 

approximately 40  of our net revenues in 2014  were derived outside the us and we sold products in more than 100 countries therefore the attendant risks of manufacturing or selling in a particular country such as nationalization and establishment of common markets may have an adverse impact on our nonus operations for a discussion of risks associated with our nonus operations see “risk factors – our global operations subject us to economic risks” and “risk factors – currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect our results” in item 1a and “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in item 7a additional geographic data is provided in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements

backlog 

our approximate backlog of orders believed to be firm at december 31  was as follows 



these backlog figures are based on orders received while the major portion of our products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock orders for specialized machinery or specific customer application are submitted with extensive lead times and are often subject to revision deferral cancellation or termination we expect to ship substantially all the december 31 2014  backlog during 2015  

environmental matters 

we continue to be dedicated to an environmental program to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process and to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the environmental protection agency and similar state authorities we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future 

we incurred  52 million   05 million  and 31 million  of expenses during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we have recorded reserves for environmental matters of  452 million  and  479 million  respectively of these amounts  363 million  and  421 million  respectively relate to remediation of sites previously disposed by us our total current environmental reserve at december 31 2014  and 2013  was  171 million  and  135 million  respectively given the evolving nature of environmental laws regulations and technology the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain 

for a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities see also part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contingent liabilities as well as note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

asbestos related matters 

certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries are named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in state and federal courts in virtually all of the suits a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants the vast majority of those claims have been filed against either ingersollrand company irnew jersey or trane us inc trane and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by irnew jersey or trane primarily pumps boilers and railroad brake shoes neither irnew jersey nor trane was a producer or manufacturer of asbestos however some formerly manufactured products utilized asbestoscontaining components such as gaskets and packings purchased from thirdparty suppliers 

we incurred net costs after insurance recoveries of 649 million  562 million  and 78 million  during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively related to the settlement and defense of asbestosrelated claims our total liability for asbestosrelated matters and our total asset for probable asbestosrelated insurance recoveries were 7766 million  and 3357 million  respectively as of december 31 2014  and 8462 million  and 3218 million  respectively as of december 31 2013

 item 1a  risk factors 

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to a number of risks that could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k the risks set forth below are those we consider most significant we face other risks however that we do not currently perceive to be material but could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from our expectations you should evaluate all risks before you invest in our securities if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted in that case the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including europe china brazil venezuela africa india argentina mexico and russia these activities are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

 these risks could increase our cost of doing business internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations limit our ability to sell products in certain markets and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 7 

our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

we must develop and commercialize new products and services in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business the development and commercialization of new products and services require a significant investment of resources we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by the market failure to develop new products and services that are accepted by the market could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and long term credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategies 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world 

our consolidated financial results reported in us dollars are exposed to changes in the exchange rates used to translate certain nonus operations into us dollars the majority of our net revenues are denominated in us dollars or chinese yuan which currently has a fixed rate of exchange with the us dollar the largest concentration of nonus denominated sales is in the euro functional currency if the average exchange rate used to translate revenue from eurodenominated operations into us dollars were to change we are exposed to impacts on net earnings 

we are also exposed to gains or losses on purchases sales and other transactions at the operating unit level that are denominated in foreign currencies we use derivative instruments to hedge those exposures that cannot be naturally offset to an insignificant amount the instruments utilized are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business or the business operations of previouslyowned entities our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation product liability and asbestosrelated matters that cannot be predicted with certainty moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against the total aggregate amount of losses sustained as a result of such proceedings and contingencies as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other events could affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 8 

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any violations of law or improper conduct could damage our reputation and depending on the circumstances subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects financial condition results of operations cash flows and the market value of our stock 

we may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are supported by third party vendors to manage and operate our business we are also investing in new information technology systems that are designed to continue improving our operations if these systems cease to function properly if these systems experience security breaches or disruptions or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

security breaches or disruptions of our technology systems infrastructure or products could negatively impact our business and financial results 

our information technology systems and infrastructure and technology embedded in certain of our control products may be subject to cyber attacks and unauthorized security intrusions in addition hardware software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly result in security breaches or disruptions the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly changing and evolving despite having instituted security policies and business continuity plans and implementing and regularly reviewing and updating processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access the everevolving threats mean we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data our systems networks and certain of our control products may be vulnerable to system damage malicious attacks from hackers employee errors or misconduct viruses power and utility outages and other catastrophic events that could cause significant harm to our business by negatively impacting our business operations compromising the security of our proprietary information or the personally identifiable data relating to our customers employees and business partners and exposing us to litigation that could adversely affect our reputation such events could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

commodity shortages and price increases and higher energy prices could adversely affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities particularly steel and nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in the prices of these commodities or the impact of inflationary increases could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows conversely in the event there is deflation the company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices there can be no assurance that the company would be able to reduce its costs through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows we do not currently use financial derivatives to hedge against this volatility while we use fixed price contracts to mitigate this exposure we expect any future hedging activity to seek to minimize nearterm volatility of the commodity prices which would not protect us from longterm commodity price increases 

additionally we are exposed to large fluctuations in the price of petroleumbased fuel due to the instability of current market prices higher energy costs increase our operating costs and the cost of shipping our products and supplying services to customers around the world consequently sharp price increases the imposition of taxes or an interruption of supply could cause us to lose the ability to effectively manage the risk of rising fuel prices and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows

our operational excellence efforts may not achieve the improvements we expect 

we utilize a number of tools such as lean six sigma to improve operational efficiency and productivity implementation of new processes to our operations could cause disruptions and there is no assurance that all of our planned operational excellence projects will be fully implemented or if implemented will realize the expected improvements 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

at december 31 2014  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled  54 billion  and  26 billion  respectively in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairments to goodwill or other indefinitelived assets any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the periods recognized 

changes in weather patterns and seasonal fluctuations may adversely affect certain segments of the companys business and impact overall results of operations 

demand for certain segments of the companys products and services is influenced by weather conditions for instance tranes sales have historically tended to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because in the us and other northern hemisphere markets summer is the peak season for sales of air conditioning systems and services therefore results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unexpected cool trends or unseasonably warm trends during the summer season could negatively or positively affect certain segments of the companys business and impact overall results of operations 

global climate change could negatively affect our business 

refrigerants are essential to many of our products and there is a growing awareness and concern regarding global warming potential of such materials as such national regional and international regulations and policies are being considered to curtail their use as we begin to see regulations impeding the use of the current class of widely used refrigerants we are planning for and managing transitions to sustainable solutions we have committed to increase energy efficiency and reduce our climate impact with operational and productrelated climate targets including among other initiatives i 50 percent reduction in the greenhouse gas refrigerant footprint of our products for customers by 2020 and lower global warming potential alternatives across our portfolio by 2030 ii 500 million investment in productrelated research and development over the next five years to fund the longterm reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and iii 35 percent reduction in the greenhouse gas footprint of our office buildings manufacturing facilities and fleet by 2020 while we are committed to pursuing these sustainable solutions there can be no assurance that our commitments will be successful that our products will be accepted by the market or that economic returns will match the investment that we are making in new product development 

concerns regarding global climate change may result in more international regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate even more restrictive standards than the voluntary commitments that we have made or require such changes on a more accelerated timeframe there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty such regulatory uncertainty extends to future incentives for energy efficient buildings and vehicles and costs of compliance which may impact the demand for our products obsolescence of our products and our results of operations 

in addition to the extent climate change influences weather patterns such changes could also disrupt our operations by causing business interruptions or by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs these factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks 

weakness in the commercial and residential construction markets may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

our commercial and residential hvac businesses which collectively represent 60 of our net revenues provide products and services to a wide range of markets including significant sales to the commercial and residential construction markets weakness in either or both of these construction markets may negatively impact the demand for our products and services decrease in the demand for our products and services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 

 10 

our business strategy includes acquiring companies entering into joint ventures and making investments that complement our existing businesses we may not identify acquisition or joint venture candidates at the same rate as the past acquisition joint ventures and investments that we identify could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses and product lines joint ventures and investments with the potential to strengthen our industry position enhance our existing set of product and services offerings or grow revenues earnings and cash flow there can be no assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable candidates in the future that we will consummate these transactions at rates similar to the past or that completed transactions will be successful acquisitions joint ventures and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows such transactions involve numerous other risks including 

 it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our business operations any acquisitions joint ventures or investments may ultimately harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as such transactions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including among others laws related to the environment and health and safety we have made and will be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations changes in current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services the us federal government and various states and municipalities have enacted or may enact legislation intended to deny government contracts to us companies that reincorporate outside of the us or have reincorporated outside of the us or may take other actions negatively impacting such companies our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties fines or other sanctions if we are unable to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 

risks relating to our past spinoff transaction 

in december 2013 we completed the spinoff of our former commercial and residential security businesses to our shareholders the spinoff pursuant to which each shareholder as of the record date for the spinoff received one ordinary share of allegion plc allegion for every three ingersollrand plc ordinary shares allegion is now an independent public company this spinoff exposed us and our shareholders to the risks described below in addition we cannot be assured that all of the anticipated benefits of the spinoff and subsequent to the spinoff will be realized 

if the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders as of the time of the distribution that are subject to us federal income tax andor allegion could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we received a ruling from the us internal revenue service the “irs” substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution of allegion plc’s ordinary shares together with certain related transactions will qualify for taxfree treatment under sections 355 and 368a of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” with the result that we and our shareholders will not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff 

 11 

except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares the “irs ruling” the irs ruling also provides that specified internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution will qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition we received opinions from the law firm of simpson thacher  bartlett llp substantially to the effect that specified requirements including certain requirements that the irs will not rule on necessary to obtain taxfree treatment have been satisfied such that the distribution for us federal income tax purposes and certain other matters relating to the distribution including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution will receive taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code the irs ruling and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and allegion regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters 

notwithstanding the irs ruling and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in shares or asset ownership after the distribution a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment and is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinion is based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution andor internal transactions ultimately is determined to be taxable we or allegion could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities which could cause a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

furthermore if notwithstanding receipt of the irs ruling and opinions the spinoff were determined to be a taxable transaction each shareholder subject to us federal income tax who received shares of allegion in the spinoff would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the allegion shares received that distribution would be taxable as a dividend to the extent of our thencurrent and accumulated earnings and profits any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the applicable shareholders tax basis in our ordinary shares with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain 

under the terms of the tax matters agreement between us and allegion executed in connection with the spinoff in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us or allegion the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us or allegion as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us or allegion then allegion would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or allegion as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant if allegion were to default in its obligation to us to pay such taxes we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of tax liabilities to the extent we are responsible for any liability under the tax matters agreement there could be a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

we might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances as a result of the distribution because of restrictions relating to us federal income tax requirements for taxfree distributions 

we may be deterred from engaging in significant equity transactions in order to preserve for us federal income tax purposes the taxfree nature of the distribution even if the distribution otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code it may result in corporatelevel taxable gain to us and certain of our affiliates under section 355e of the code if 50 or more by vote or value of our shares or allegion’s shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution any acquisitions or issuances of our shares or allegion’s shares within two years after the distribution will generally be presumed to be part of such a plan although we or allegion may be able to rebut that presumption as a result we may not pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that would otherwise maximize the value of our business 

if the distribution is determined to be taxable for irish tax purposes significant irish tax liabilities may arise 

we received an opinion of the irish revenue regarding the irish tax consequences of the distribution to the effect that certain reliefs and exemptions for corporate reorganizations apply in addition to obtaining the opinion from irish revenue we also received opinions from the law firm of arthur cox confirming the applicability of the relevant exemptions and reliefs to the distribution as well as received opinions from other external advisers that certain internal transactions will not trigger irish tax costs as well these opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and allegion regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the opinions irish revenue could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions do not qualify for the relevant exemptions or reliefs if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment and is not binding on irish revenue or the courts and irish revenue or the courts may not agree with the legal opinion in addition the legal opinion is based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution ultimately is determined not to fall within certain exemptions or reliefs the distribution could result in certain of our shareholders having an irish tax liability as a result of the distribution or we or allegion 

 12 

could incur irish tax liabilities to the extent we are responsible for any such liability under the tax matters agreement there could be a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

risks relating to our past reorganizations   

we effected a corporate reorganization in december 2001 to become a bermuda company the bermuda reorganization and a subsequent corporate reorganization in july 2009 to become an irish public limited company these reorganizations exposed us and our shareholders to the risks described below in addition we cannot be assured that all of the anticipated benefits of the reorganizations will be realized 

changes in tax or other laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under us or nonus laws or adverse determinations by taxing or other governmental authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our reorganizations could be impacted by changes in tax or other laws treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the us or nonus tax or other governmental authorities from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws regulations or interpretations thereof of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for instance recent us legislative proposals would broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident for us tax purposes which would significantly diminish the realization of any tax benefit related to our reorganizations there are other recent us legislative proposals that could modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position moreover other us legislative proposals could have a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments by our us subsidiaries to our nonus affiliates which could increase our tax liability we cannot predict the outcome of any of these potential changes in any jurisdiction 

while we monitor proposals and other developments that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals or regulatory changes are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax or other laws is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding the ireland reorganization limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

while our us operations are subject to us tax we believe that a significant portion of our nonus operations are generally not subject to us tax other than withholding taxes the irs or a court however may not concur with our conclusions including our determination that we and a significant number of our foreign subsidiaries are not controlled foreign corporations cfc within the meaning of the us tax laws a contrary determination which could also arise through significant future acquisitions of our stock by us persons could also potentially cause us holders direct indirect or constructive owners of 10 or more of our stock or the voting stock of our nonus subsidiaries to include in their gross income their pro rata share of certain of our and our nonus subsidiary income for the period during which we and our nonus subsidiaries were a cfc in addition gain or a portion of such gain realized on cfc shares sold by such shareholders may be treated as ordinary income depending on certain facts treatment of us or any of our nonus subsidiaries as a cfc could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

as described further in “legal proceedings” we have received several notices from the irs containing proposed adjustments to our tax filings in connection with audits of the 20012006 tax years the irs has not contested the validity of our reincorporation in bermuda in any of these notices we have and intend to continue to vigorously contest all of these proposed adjustments 

although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty based upon an analysis of the merits of our position we believe that we are adequately reserved for these matters and do not expect that the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition or cash flows as we move forward to resolve these matters with the irs the reserves established may be adjusted although we continue to contest the irss position there can be no assurance that we will be successful if the irss position with respect to 20022006 is ultimately sustained we would be required to record additional charges and the resulting liability would have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows furthermore a substantial amount of information has been provided to the irs in connection with its audit of our 20072011 tax years we expect the irs to propose similar adjustments with respect to the intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in bermuda although we do not know how the irs will apply its position to the different facts presented in these years or whether the irs will take a similar position with respect to intercompany debt instruments not outstanding in prior years

the inability to realize any anticipated tax benefits related to our reorganizations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities   

the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemptive rights with respect to any particular allotment of shares under irish law these authorizations must be renewed by the shareholders every five years and we cannot guarantee that these authorizations will always be approved beginning with the 2014 proxy season institutional shareholder services iss began taking the position that irish companies should limit these authorizations in terms of the number of authorized but unissued shares that can be issued without shareholder approval to 33 of such company’s issued ordinary share capital the number of shares that can be issued without preemptive rights to up to 5 of such company’s issued ordinary share capital and the duration of the authorizations to eighteen months if we are required to conform these authorizations to the iss standards in order to obtain shareholder approval we will be limited in our ability to issue shares in ways that us companies are not limited and will need to renew the authorizations even more frequently than the fiveyear period provided under irish law 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax   

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders resident in the united states will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could have an adverse impact on the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax   

dividends paid in respect of our shares will generally not be subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in irireland 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in irireland

tax related matters 

in 2007 we received a notice from the irs containing proposed adjustments to our tax filings in connection with an audit of the 2001 and 2002 tax years the irs did not contest the validity of our reincorporation in bermuda the irs proposed to ignore the entities that hold the intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in bermuda the “2001 debt” and to which the interest was paid and impose 30 withholding tax on a portion of the interest payments as if they were made directly to a company that was not eligible for reduced us withholding tax under a us income tax treaty the irs asserted that we owe additional taxes with respect to 2002 of approximately 84 million  plus interest in 2010 we received an amended notice from the irs assessing penalties of 30  on the asserted underpayment of tax described above 

we have so far been unsuccessful in resolving this dispute and in 2013 received a notice of deficiency from the irs for 2002 the company filed a petition in the united states tax court in november 2013 contesting this deficiency in its january 2014 

 15 

answer to our petition the irs asserted that we also owe 30  withholding tax on the portion of 2002 interest payments made on the 2001 debt upon which it did not previously assert withholding tax this increases the total tax liability proposed for 2002 to 1090 million   840 million  referred to in the paragraph above plus an additional 250 million  plus 30  penalties and interest 

in 2013 we received notices from the irs containing proposed adjustments to the companys tax filings in connection with an audit of the 20032006 tax years in these notices the irs asserts that we owe a total of approximately 665 million  of additional taxes as described more fully in the two paragraphs below in connection with our interest payments on the 2001 debt for the 20032006 period plus penalties and interest on these unpaid taxes 

the irs continues to take the position on the 2001 debt which was retired at the end of 2011 that it previously took for our 2002 tax year and which is described above as a result of this recharacterization the irs asserts that we owe approximately 455 million  of withholding tax for 20032006 plus 30  penalties 

the irs also proposes to extend its position further and to treat all of the interest income from the 2001 debt as creating earnings and profits at irlimited and as a result recharacterize the distributions made by irlimited during the 20022006 tax years as taxable dividends instead of as a return of capital consequently the irs asserts that we owe approximately 210 million  of income tax on these dividends plus penalties of 20  we strongly disagree with the view of the irs and filed a protest in january 2014 for the 20032006 tax years 

furthermore a substantial amount of information has been provided to the irs in connection with its audit of our 20072011 tax years we expect the irs to propose similar adjustments with respect to the 2001 debt although we do not know how the irs will apply its position to the different facts presented in these years or whether the irs will take a similar position with respect to intercompany debt instruments not outstanding in prior years 

we have vigorously contested all of these proposed adjustments and intend to continue to do so although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty based upon an analysis of the merits of our position we believe that we are adequately reserved under the applicable accounting standards for these matters and do not expect that the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition or cash flows as we move forward to resolve these matters with the irs the reserves established may be adjusted although we continue to contest the irss position there can be no assurance that we will be successful if the irss position with respect to the 20022006 tax years is ultimately sustained we would be required to record additional charges and the resulting liability would have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of any tax disputes but will adjust our reserves if events so dictate in accordance with gaap to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes

venezuela currency devaluation 

in february 2013 the government of venezuela announced a devaluation of the bolivar from the preexisting official exchange rate obtained through the national center of foreign trade cencoex formerly cadivi through april 2014 of 429 bolivars to the us dollar to 63 bolivars to the us dollar we have one subsidiary with operations in venezuela due to the designation of venezuela as highly inflationary the us dollar was determined to be the functional currency for this subsidiary as a result of the devaluation we realized a foreign currency translation loss of approximately 38 million in the year ended december 31 2013 

in january 2014 the venezuelan government significantly expanded the use of the supplementary foreign currency administration system sicad i exchange market and created a third exchange market called sicad ii these markets have exchange rates significantly less favorable than the cencoex rate the venezuelan government also indicated that the cencoex rate will be reserved for purchases of “essential goods and services” in february 2015 the venezuelan government announced a new exchange market called the marginal currency system simadi which will replace the sicad ii exchange and allow for trading based on supply and demand an exchange rate for the simadi market has not been published 

the financial position and results of our venezuelan subsidiary as of december 31 2014 are reflected in usd utilizing the cencoex rate and not the december 31 2014 sicad i 120 bolivars to 100 sicad ii 4998 bolivars to 100 or simadi rates due to our belief that our imports will continue to qualify for the cencoex rate and our intent to continue to pursue this rate for future exchanges however we will continue to monitor the evolving venezuela exchange market including the establishment of the new simadi exchange market 

as of december 31 2014 we had net monetary assets of approximately 273 million bolivars for 2014 annual net revenues of our venezuela subsidiary were approximately 300 million bolivars further devaluation of the bolivar or our inability to convert our net monetary assets denominated in bolivars into us dollars at certain of the exchange rates discussed above could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

irs exam results 

in 2007 we received a notice from the irs containing proposed adjustments to our tax filings in connection with an audit of the 2001 and 2002 tax years the irs did not contest the validity of our reincorporation in bermuda the irs proposed to ignore the entities that hold the intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in bermuda the “2001 debt” and to which the interest was paid and impose 30 withholding tax on a portion of the interest payments as if they were made directly to a company that was not eligible for reduced us withholding tax under a us income tax treaty the irs asserted that we owe additional taxes with respect to 2002 of approximately 84 million  plus interest in 2010 we received an amended notice from the irs assessing penalties of 30  on the asserted underpayment of tax described above

furthermore a substantial amount of information has been provided to the irs in connection with its audit of our 20072011 tax years we expect the irs to propose similar adjustments with respect to the 2001 debt although we do not know how the irs will apply its position to the different facts presented in these years or whether the irs will take a similar position with respect to intercompany debt instruments not outstanding in prior years 

we have vigorously contested all of these proposed adjustments and intend to continue to do so although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty based upon an analysis of the merits of our position we believe that we are adequately reserved under the applicable accounting standards for these matters and do not expect that the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition or cash flows as we move forward to resolve these matters with the irs the reserves established may be adjusted although we continue to contest the irss position there can be no assurance that we will be successful if the irss position with respect to the 20022006 tax years is ultimately sustained we would be required to record additional charges and the resulting liability would have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows

provision for income taxes 

the 2014 effective tax rate was 243 the 2014 effective tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to earnings in nonus jurisdictions which in aggregate have a lower effective rate partially offset by us state and local income taxes and us tax on nonus earnings revenues from nonus jurisdictions account for approximately 40 of our total revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the us at rates ranging from 0 to 38 when comparing the results of multiple reporting periods among other factors the mix of earnings between us and foreign jurisdictions can cause variability on our overall effective tax rate 

the 2013 effective tax rate was 228 the 2013 effective tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to earnings in nonus jurisdictions which in aggregate have a lower effective rate and a 36 million net reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits primarily due to the settlement of an audit in a major tax jurisdiction partially offset by a tax charge of 51 million as a result of a change in assertion in certain subsidiary earnings that the company has previously determined to be permanently reinvested and approximately 74 million of allegion spinoff tax charges primarily related to a net increase in our valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets 

 the 2012 effective tax rate was 66 which included a tax benefit of approximately 1400 million resulting from a reduction in valuation allowances on certain nonus deferred tax assets the 2012 effective tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate of 350 primarily due to earnings in nonus jurisdictions which in aggregate have a lower effective rate and a reduction in valuation allowances mentioned above partially offset by a net increase in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits

review of business segments 

the segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment included in continuing operations 

segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for performance reviews compensation and resource allocation for these reasons we believe that segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss we may exclude certain charges or gains from operating income to arrive at a segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of 

 27 

profit and loss upon which to base our operating decisions we define segment operating margin as segment operating income as a percentage of net revenues

liquidity and capital resources 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income in jurisdictions where it is deemed to be permanently reinvested our most prominent jurisdiction of operation is the us we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate funds to the us and no provision for us income taxes has been made with respect to such earnings we expect existing cash and cash equivalents available to the us the cash generated by our us operations our committed credit lines as well as our expected ability to access the capital and debt markets will be sufficient to fund our us operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future in addition we expect existing nonus cash and cash equivalents and the cash generated by our nonus operations will be sufficient to fund our nonus operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our us operations and we determine that repatriation of nonus cash is necessary such amounts would be subject to us federal income taxes 

in february 2015 we announced an increase in our quarterly share dividend from 025 to 029 per share beginning with our march 2015 payment in february 2014 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15 billion  of our ordinary shares under a new share repurchase program upon completion of the current share repurchase program the new share repurchase program began in april of 2014 during the year ended december 31 2014 we repurchased 230 million  shares for  14 billion  of which 98 million shares for 5834 million were under the 2014 program we expect our available cash flow committed credit lines and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to fund the increased dividend and share repurchases

pension plans 

our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due we seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities we use a dynamic approach to asset allocation whereby a plans allocation to fixed income assets increases as the plans funded status improves we monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance 

we monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis none of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to the volatility in the markets for further details on pension plan activity see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

cash flows 

the following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended december 31 respectively for additional details please see the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was  9917 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared with  7988 million  in 2013  operating cash flows for 2014 reflect improved earnings from continuing operations partially offset by rising working capital in 2014 

 32 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was  7988 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared with  8825 million  in 2012  operating cash flows for 2013 reflect consistent earnings from continuing operations after taking into account spinrelated tax charges with no cash impact in 2013 and favorable changes in working capital 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was  1970 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared with  2132 million  in 2013  the change in investing activities is primarily attributable to 303 million cash dividend received from equity investments during the year ended december 31 2014 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was  2132 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared with  1282 million  in 2012  the change in investing activities is primarily attributable to increased capital expenditures and decreased net proceeds from business dispositions and equity investments in 2013 compared to 2012 

financing activities

capital resources 

based on historical performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance the cash generated from our operations our committed credit lines and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures dividends share repurchase programs upcoming debt maturities and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the foreseeable future 

capital expenditures were  2335 million   2422 million  and  2431 million  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively our investments continue to improve manufacturing productivity reduce costs and provide environmental enhancements and advanced technologies for existing facilities the capital expenditure program for 2015  is estimated to be approximately 320 million including amounts approved in prior periods many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at our option without incurring substantial charges 

for financial market risk impacting the company see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

capitalization 

in addition to cash on hand and operating cash flow we maintain significant credit availability under our commercial paper program our ability to borrow at a costeffective rate under the commercial paper program is contingent upon maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating as of december 31 2014  our credit ratings were as follows 



the credit ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

our public debt does not contain financial covenants and our revolving credit lines have a debttototal capital covenant of 65 as of december 31 2014  our debttototal capital ratio was significantly beneath this limit 

 33 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment periods in millions 



 includes 3430 million of debt redeemable at the option of the holder the scheduled maturities of these bonds range between 2027 and 2028 see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above 

pensions 

at december 31 2014  we had net obligations of  7010 million  which consist of noncurrent pension assets of  115 million  and current and noncurrent pension benefit liabilities of  7125 million  it is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required we currently project that we will contribute approximately  599 million  to our plans worldwide in 2015  the timing and amounts of future contributions are dependent upon the funding status of the plan which is expected to vary as a result of changes in interest rates returns on underlying assets and other factors therefore pension contributions have been excluded from the preceding table see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

postretirement benefits other than pensions 

at december 31 2014  we had postretirement benefit obligations of  7007 million  we fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a payasyougo basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations benefit payments which are net of expected plan participant contributions and medicare part d subsidy are expected to be approximately  595 million  in 2015  because benefit payments are not required to be funded in advance and the timing and amounts of future payments for are dependent on the cost of benefits for retirees covered by the plan they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income taxes 

at december 31 2014  we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of  3438 million  and  697 million  of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax the liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits and internal revenue service irs tax disputes 

contingent liabilities 

we are involved in various litigations claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

see note 7 and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on matters affecting our liquidity 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

 34 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

 recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test included in us gaap for those reporting units where it is required the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a second step is performed wherein the reporting units carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value impairment exists and must be recognized 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is determined using three valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model an income approach a marketadjusted multiple of earnings and revenues a market approach and a similar transactions method also a market approach the discounted cash flow approach relies on the companys estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing growth and margins with due consideration given to forecasting risk the earnings and revenue multiple approach reflects the markets expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publicly traded companies and the subject reporting units the similar transactions method considers prices paid in transactions that have recently occurred in our industry or in related industries these methods are weighted 50 40 and 10 respectively 

in step 2 the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit 

recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is first assessed using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired this assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset for those indefinitelived assets where it is required a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology income approach which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess 

the determination of the estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows including profit margins longterm forecasts discount rates and terminal growth rates we developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit 

2014 impairment test 

for our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2014 we calculated the fair value for each of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangibles based on the results of these calculations we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values the estimates of fair 

 35 

value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

goodwill   under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 105 to 150 near term growth rates ranging from 30 to 196 and terminal growth rates ranging from 30 to 35 under the market approach we used an adjusted multiple ranging from 70 to 115 of projected earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda based on the market information of comparable companies additionally we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization 

for all reporting units the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 50 a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units 

other indefinitelived intangible assets   in testing our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates of 125 terminal growth rate of 30 and royalty rates ranging from 30 to 45 for all tradenames the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 36 

a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our tradenames 

2013 impairment test 

for our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2013 we concluded it was necessary to calculate the fair value for each of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangibles based on the results of these calculations we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

goodwill   under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 100  to 155  near term growth rates ranging from 02  to 87  and terminal growth rates ranging from 30  to 40  under the market approach we used an adjusted multiple ranging from 72  to 98  of projected earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and 09  to 24  of projected revenues based on the market information of comparable companies additionally we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization 

for all reporting units the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 15 a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units 

in our 2012 form 10k we disclosed a security technologies reporting unit whose excess estimated fair value over carrying value was less than 15 as a result of the spinoff beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013 this reporting unit is now presented within discontinued operations please see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment charges related to discontinued operations 

other indefinitelived intangible assets   in testing our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 105 to 120 terminal growth rate of 30 and royalty rates ranging from 30 to 45 for all tradenames the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 15 

a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our tradenames 

2012 impairment test 

for our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2012 we concluded it was necessary to calculate the fair value for each of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangibles based on the results of these calculations we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

 36 

goodwill   under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 110  to 155  near term growth rates ranging from 35  to 145  and terminal growth rates ranging from 25  to 40  under the market approach we used an adjusted multiple ranging from 66  to 92  of projected earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and 08  to 18  of projected revenues based on the market information of comparable companies additionally we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization 

for all reporting units except one the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 15  the reporting unit with a percentage of carrying value less than 15 reported within the climate segment exceeded its carrying value by 144  this reporting unit had goodwill of approximately  599 million  at december 31 2012 a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units 

other indefinitelived intangible assets   in testing our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 120 to 125 terminal growth rates ranging from 25 to 30 and royalty rates ranging from 30 to 40 the fair values of our trane and american standard tradenames exceeded their respective carrying amounts by less than 15 the two tradenames exceeded their carrying value by 105 and 130 respectively the carrying values of these tradenames are approximately 2497 million and 105 million respectively at december 31 2012 

a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our tradenames

is not deemed to be reasonably assured then revenue recognition is deferred until such time that collectability becomes probable or cash is received delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer has taken title and assumed the risks and rewards of ownership service and installation revenue are recognized when earned in some instances customer acceptance provisions are included in sales arrangements to give the buyer the ability to ensure the delivered product or service meets the criteria established in the order in these instances revenue recognition is deferred until the acceptance terms specified in the arrangement are fulfilled through customer acceptance or a demonstration that established criteria have been satisfied if uncertainty exists about customer acceptance revenue is not recognized until acceptance has occurred 

we offer various sales incentive programs to our customers dealers and distributors sales incentive programs do not preclude revenue recognition but do require an accrual for the companys best estimate of expected activity examples of the sales incentives that are accrued for as a contra receivable and sales deduction at the point of sale include but are not limited to discounts ie net 30 type coupons and rebates where the customer does not have to provide any additional requirements to receive the discount sales returns and customer disputes involving a question of quantity or price are also accounted for as a reduction in revenue and a contra receivable at december 31 2014 and 2013 the company had a customer claim accrual contra receivable of 47 million  and 17 million  respectively all other incentives or incentive programs where the customer is required to reach a certain sales level remain a customer for a certain period of time provide a rebate form or is subject to additional requirements are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and establishment of a liability at december 31 2014 and 2013 the company had a sales incentive accrual of 734 million  and 801 million  respectively each of these accruals represents the best estimate the company expects to pay related to previously sold units these estimates are reviewed regularly for accuracy if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

the company enters into maintenance and extended warranty contracts with customers revenue related to these services is recognized on a straightline basis over the life of the contract unless sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of providing these services is incurred on an other than straightline basis in these circumstances revenue is recognized over the contract period in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing the service 

the company primarily through its climate segment provides equipment eg hvac controls integrated solutions and installation designed to customer specifications through constructiontype contracts the term of these types of contracts is typically less than one year but can be as long as three years revenues related to these contracts are recognized using the percentageofcompletion method in accordance with gaap this measure of progress toward completion utilized to recognize sales and profits is based on the proportion of actual cost incurred to date as compared to the total estimate of contract costs at completion the timing of revenue recognition often differs from the invoicing schedule to the customer with revenue recognition in advance of customer invoicing recorded to unbilled accounts receivable and invoicing in advance of revenue recognition recorded to deferred revenue at december 31 2014  all recorded receivables billed and unbilled are due within one year the company reevaluates its contract estimates periodically and reflects changes in estimates in the current period using the cumulative catchup method these periodic reviews have not historically resulted in significant adjustments if estimated contract costs are in excess of contract revenues then the excess costs are accrued 

we enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple elements such as equipment installation and service revenue for multiple element arrangements each element is evaluated to determine the separate units of accounting the total arrangement consideration is then allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price at the inception of the arrangement the relative selling price is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if it exists otherwise thirdparty evidence tpe of selling price is used if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable a best estimate of the selling price is developed for that deliverable the company primarily utilizes vsoe to determine its relative selling price the company recognizes revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has standalone value to the customer the basic revenue recognition criteria have been met and only customary refund or return rights related to the delivered elements exist 

 the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income 

 38 

and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 

 changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the expected 2015 net periodic pension cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 95 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately 73 million a 025 rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would increase expected 2015 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by 06 million and a 10 increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the service and interest cost by approximately 11 million

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world 

our consolidated financial results reported in us dollars are exposed to changes in the exchange rates used to translate certain nonus operations into us dollars approximately 63 of net revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 were denominated in us dollars and 7 were denominated in chinese yuan which currently has a fixed rate of exchange with the us dollar the largest concentration of nonus denominated sales is in the euro functional currency which was approximately 10 of net revenues for year ended december 31 2014 if the average exchange rate used to translate revenue from eurodenominated operations into us dollars changed unfavorably by 001 compared to the actual exchange rates used net earnings would have been approximately 2 million lower for the year ended december 31 2014 equivalent to a reduction in earnings per share of 001 

we are also exposed to gains or losses on purchases sales and other transactions at the operating unit level that are denominated in foreign currencies we use derivative instruments to hedge those exposures that cannot be naturally offset to an insignificant amount the instruments utilized are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or 

 40 

speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2014  a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an unrealized loss of approximately  442 million  as compared with  1078 million  at december 31 2013  these amounts when realized would be offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions 

effective january 1 2010 venezuela was determined to be a highly inflationary economy and we changed the functional currency of our operations in venezuela to the us dollar on february 8 2013the government of venezuela announced a devaluation of the bolivar from the preexisting official exchange rate obtained through the national center of foreign trade cencoex formerly cadivi through april 2014 of 429 bolivars to the us dollar to 63 bolivars to the us dollar we have one subsidiary with operations in venezuela due to the designation of venezuela as highly inflationary the us dollar was determined to be the functional currency for this subsidiary as a result of the devaluation we realized a foreign currency translation loss of approximately 38 million in the year ended december 31 2013 

in january 2014 the venezuelan government significantly expanded the use of the supplementary foreign currency administration system sicad i exchange market and created a third exchange market called sicad ii these markets have exchange rates significantly less favorable than the cencoex rate the venezuelan government also indicated that the cencoex rate will be reserved for purchases of “essential goods and services” in february 2015 the venezuelan government announced a new exchange market called the marginal currency system simadi which will replace the sicad ii exchange and allow for trading based on supply and demand an exchange rate for the simadi market has not been published 

the financial position and results of our venezuelan subsidiary as of december 31 2014 are reflected in usd utilizing the cencoex rate and not the december 31 2014 sicad i 120 bolivars to 100 sicad ii 4998 bolivars to 100 or simadi rates due to our belief that our imports will continue to qualify for the cencoex rate and our intent to continue to pursue this rate for future exchanges however we will continue to monitor the evolving venezuela exchange market including the establishment of the new simadi exchange market 

as of december 31 2014 we had net monetary assets of approximately 273 million bolivars for 2014 annual net revenues of our venezuela subsidiary were approximately 300 million bolivars further devaluation of the bolivar or our inability to convert our net monetary assets denominated in bolivars into us dollars at certain of the exchange rates discussed above could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2014  

interest rate exposure 

our debt portfolio mainly consists of fixedrate instruments and therefore any fluctuation in market interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations

business segments

in the fourth quarter of 2013 the company realigned its organizational structure to provide a greater focus on growth continue implementation of business operating systems build on our successful operational excellence philosophy and reduce complexity and costs the company’s new reporting structure includes the climate and industrial segments 

our business segments are as follows 

climate 

our climate segment delivers energyefficient solutions globally and includes trane ®  and american standard ®  heating  air conditioning which provide heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac systems and commercial and residential building services parts support and controls and thermo king ®  transport temperature control solutions this segment had 2013  net revenues of  94 billion

segment revenue and profit information and additional financial data and commentary on recent financial results for operating segments are provided in the review of business segments section in part ii item7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

products and services 

our principal products and services by business segment include the following 





these products are sold primarily under our name and under other names including american standard aro club car thermo king and trane 

competitive conditions 

our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world due to the diversity of these products and services and the variety of markets served we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line and services they include wellestablished regional or specialized competitors as well as larger us and nonus corporations or divisions of larger companies 

the principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price quality delivery service and support technology and innovation we believe that we are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of hvac systems and services air compression systems transport temperature control products air tools and golf and utility vehicles 

 4 

distribution 

our products are distributed by a number of methods which we believe are appropriate to the type of product us sales are made through branch sales offices distributors and dealers across the country nonus sales are made through numerous subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world 

customers 

we have no customer that accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues in 2013  2012  or 2011  no material part of our business is dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers therefore the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

raw materials 

we manufacture many of the components included in our products which requires us to employ a wide variety of commodities principal commodities such as steel copper and aluminum are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world in the past higher prices for some commodities particularly steel and nonferrous metals have caused pricing pressures in some of our businesses we have historically been able to pass certain of these cost increases on to customers in the form of price increases however we may not always be able to offset these cost increases with price increases 

we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future there have been no commodity shortages which have had a material adverse effect on our businesses however significant changes in certain material costs may have an adverse impact on our costs and operating margins to mitigate this potential impact we enter into longterm supply contracts in order to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions 

working capital 

we manufacture products that usually must be readily available to meet our customers’ rapid delivery requirements therefore we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs and our customers’ requirements such working capital requirements are not however in the opinion of management materially different from those experienced by our major competitors we believe our sales and payment terms are competitive in and appropriate for the markets in which we compete 

seasonality 

demand for certain of our products and services is influenced by weather conditions for instance tranes sales have historically tended to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because this represents summer in the us and other northern hemisphere markets which is the peak season for sales of air conditioning systems and services therefore results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unexpected cool trends or unseasonably warm trends during the summer season could negatively or positively affect certain segments of our business and impact overall results of operations 

research and development 

we engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products enhance existing product effectiveness improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate in addition we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment or acquisition we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development activities as we look to maintain and improve our competitive position research and development expenditures were approximately  2182 million  in 2013   2354 million  in 2012  and  2184 million  in 2011  

patents and licenses 

we own numerous patents and patent applications and are licensed under others although in aggregate we consider our patents and licenses to be valuable to our operations we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single patent or license or any group of them in our opinion engineering production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our patents andor licenses 

operations by geographic area 

more than 40  of our 2013  net revenues were derived outside the us and we sold products in more than 100 countries therefore the attendant risks of manufacturing or selling in a particular country such as nationalization and establishment of common markets may have an adverse impact on our nonus operations for a discussion of risks associated with our nonus operations see 

 5 

“risk factors – our global operations subject us to economic risks” and “risk factors – currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results” in item 1a and “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in item 7a 

backlog 

our approximate backlog of orders believed to be firm at december 31  was as follows 

  

these backlog figures are based on orders received while the major portion of our products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock orders for specialized machinery or specific customer application are submitted with extensive lead times and are often subject to revision deferral cancellation or termination we expect to ship substantially all the december 31 2013  backlog during 2014  

environmental matters 

we continue to be dedicated to an environmental program to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process and to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the environmental protection agency and similar state authorities we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future 

we incurred  05 million   31 million  and 12 million  of expenses during the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us as of december 31 2013  and 2012  we have recorded reserves for environmental matters of  479 million  and  556 million  respectively of these amounts  421 million  and  412 million  respectively relate to remediation of sites previously disposed by us our total current environmental reserve at december 31 2013  and 2012  was  135 million  and  180 million  respectively given the evolving nature of environmental laws regulations and technology the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain 

for a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities see also part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental and asbestos matters as well as note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

asbestos related matters 

certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries are named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in state and federal courts in virtually all of the suits a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants the vast majority of those claims have been filed against either ingersollrand company irnew jersey or trane us inc trane and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by irnew jersey or trane primarily pumps boilers and railroad brake shoes neither irnew jersey nor trane was a producer or manufacturer of asbestos however some formerly manufactured products utilized asbestoscontaining components such as gaskets and packings purchased from thirdparty suppliers 

we incurred net costs after insurance recoveries of 562 million  78 million  and 164 million  during the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively related to the settlement and defense of asbestosrelated claims of these amounts 558 million  179 million  and 145 million  for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively relate to discontinued operations our total liability for asbestosrelated matters and our total asset for probable asbestosrelated insurance recoveries were 8462 million  and 3218 million  respectively as of december 31 2013  and 8795 million  and 3203 million  respectively as of december 31 2012  our total current liability for asbestosrelated matters and our total current asset for probable asbestos 

 6 

related insurance recoveries was 691 million  and 223 million  respectively as of december 31 2013  and 691 million  and 225 million  respectively as of december 31 2012

 item 1a  risk factors 

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to a number of risks that could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k the risks set forth below are those we consider most significant we face other risks however that we do not currently perceive to be material but could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from our expectations you should evaluate all risks before you invest in our securities if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted in that case the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including europe china brazil venezuela africa india argentina and mexico these activities are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

  7 

 these risks could increase our cost of doing business internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations limit our ability to sell products in certain markets and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

we must develop and commercialize new products and services in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business the development and commercialization of new products and services require a significant investment of resources we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by the market failure to develop new products and services that are accepted by the market could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and long term credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategies 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

more than 40  of our 2013  net revenues were derived outside the us and we expect sales to nonus customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues although we enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to currency exchange fluctuations changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time may in some instances have a material impact on our results of operations because we do not hedge against all of our currency exposure our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations 

we also translate assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in nonus dollar currencies into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements based on the applicable exchange rates consequently fluctuations in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies could have a material impact on the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business or the business operations of previouslyowned entities our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation product liability and asbestosrelated matters that cannot be predicted with certainty moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against the total aggregate amount of losses sustained as a result of such proceedings and contingencies as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other events could affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 8 

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any violations of law or improper conduct could damage our reputation and depending on the circumstances subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects financial condition results of operations cash flows and the market value of our stock 

we may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are supported by third party vendors to manage and operate our business we are also investing in new information technology systems that are designed to continue improving our operations if these systems cease to function properly or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

security breaches or disruptions of our technology infrastructure or products could negatively impact our business and financial results 

our information technology infrastructure and technology embedded in certain of our control products may be subject to cyber attacks and unauthorized security intrusions despite instituting security policies and business continuity plans our systems networks and certain of our control products may be vulnerable to system damage malicious attacks from hackers employee errors or misconduct viruses power and utility outages and other catastrophic events that could cause significant harm to our business by negatively impacting our business operations compromising the security of our proprietary information and exposing us to litigation that could adversely affect our reputation such events could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

commodity shortages and price increases and higher energy prices could adversely affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities particularly steel and nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows we do not currently use financial derivatives to hedge against this volatility while we use fixed price contracts to mitigate this exposure we expect any future hedging activity to seek to minimize nearterm volatility of the commodity prices which would not protect us from longterm commodity price increases 

additionally we are exposed to large fluctuations in the price of petroleumbased fuel due to the instability of current market prices higher energy costs increase our operating costs and the cost of shipping our products and supplying services to customers around the world consequently sharp price increases the imposition of taxes or an interruption of supply could cause us to lose the ability to effectively manage the risk of rising fuel prices and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

our operational excellence efforts may not achieve the improvements we expect 

we utilize a number of tools such as lean six sigma to improve operational efficiency and productivity implementation of new processes to our operations could cause disruptions and there is no assurance that all of our planned operational excellence projects will be fully implemented or if implemented will realize the expected improvements 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

at december 31 2013  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled  55 billion  and  26 billion  respectively in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairments to goodwill or other indefinitelived assets any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the periods recognized

changes in weather patterns and seasonal fluctuations may adversely affect certain segments of the companys business and impact overall results of operations 

demand for certain segments of the companys products and services is influenced by weather conditions for instance tranes sales have historically tended to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because in the us and other northern hemisphere markets summer is the peak season for sales of air conditioning systems and services therefore results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unexpected cool trends or unseasonably warm trends during the summer season could negatively or positively affect certain segments of the companys business and impact overall results of operations 

weakness in the commercial and residential construction markets may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

our commercial and residential hvac businesses which collectively represent 61 of our net revenues provide products and services to a wide range of markets including significant sales to the commercial and residential construction markets weakness in either or both of these construction markets may negatively impact the demand for our products and services decrease in the demand for our products and services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including among others laws related to the environment and health and safety we have made and will be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations changes in current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services in addition our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties fines or other sanctions if we are unable to effectively respond to changes to a pplicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 

risks relating to our spinoff of allegion 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that w e expect to achieve subsequent to the spinoff 

in connection with our spinoff in december 2013 of allegion which now owns our former commercial and residential security businesses we anticipated certain financial operational managerial and other benefits to us and our shareholders in particular we commenced certain operational excellence and other productivity and strategic initiatives following the spinoff intended to provide a greater focus on growth and to reduce complexity and overhead cost we may not be able to achieve the anticipated results of these actions on the scale that we expected and the anticipated benefits subsequent to the spinoff and those operational excellence and other productivity and strategic initiatives may not be fully realized 

if the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders as of the time of the distribution that are subject to us federal income tax andor allegion could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we have received a ruling from the us internal revenue service the “irs” substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution of allegion plc’s ordinary shares together with certain related transactions will qualify for taxfree treatment under sections 355 and 368a of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” with the result that we and our shareholders will not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares the “irs ruling” the irs ruling also provides that specified internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution will qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition we have received opinions from the law firm of simpson thacher  bartlett llp substantially to the effect that specified requirements including certain requirements that the irs will not rule on necessary to obtain taxfree treatment have been satisfied such that the distribution for us federal income tax purposes and certain other matters relating to the distribution including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution will receive taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code the irs ruling and the opinions rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and allegion regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters 

notwithstanding the irs ruling and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in shares or asset ownership after the distribution a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment and is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in 

 10 

addition the opinion is based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution andor internal transactions ultimately is determined to be taxable we or allegion could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities which could cause a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

furthermore if notwithstanding receipt of the irs ruling and opinions the spinoff were determined to be a taxable transaction each shareholder subject to us federal income tax who received shares of allegion in the spinoff would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the allegion shares received that distribution would be taxable as a dividend to the extent of our thencurrent and accumulated earnings and profits any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the applicable shareholders tax basis in our ordinary shares with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain 

under the terms of the tax matters agreement between us and allegion executed in connection with the spinoff in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us or allegion the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us or allegion as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us or allegion then allegion would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or allegion as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant if allegion were to default in its obligation to us to pay such taxes we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of tax liabilities to the extent we are responsible for any liability under the tax matters agreement there could be a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

we might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances as a result of the distribution because of restrictions relating to us federal income tax requirements for taxfree distributions 

we may be deterred from engaging in significant equity transactions in order to preserve for us federal income tax purposes the taxfree nature of the distribution even if the distribution otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code it may result in corporatelevel taxable gain to us and certain of our affiliates under section 355e of the code if 50 or more by vote or value of our shares or allegion’s shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution any acquisitions or issuances of our shares or allegion’s shares within two years after the distribution will generally be presumed to be part of such a plan although we or allegion may be able to rebut that presumption as a result we may not pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that would otherwise maximize the value of our business 

if the distribution is determined to be taxable for irish tax purposes significant irish tax liabilities may arise 

we have received an opinion of the irish revenue regarding the irish tax consequences of the distribution to the effect that certain reliefs and exemptions for corporate reorganizations apply in addition to obtaining the opinion from irish revenue we have also received opinions from the law firm of arthur cox confirming the applicability of the relevant exemptions and reliefs to the distribution as well as received opinions from other external advisers that certain internal transactions will not trigger irish tax costs as well these opinions rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and allegion regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the opinions irish revenue could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions do not qualify for the relevant exemptions or reliefs if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment and is not binding on irish revenue or the courts and irish revenue or the courts may not agree with the legal opinion in addition the legal opinion is based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution ultimately is determined not to fall within certain exemptions or reliefs the distribution could result in certain of our shareholders having an irish tax liability as a result of the distribution or we or allegion could incur irish tax liabilities to the extent we are responsible for any such liability under the tax matters agreement there could be a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

risks relating to our past reorganizations   

we effected a corporate reorganization in december 2001 to become a bermuda company the bermuda reorganization and a subsequent corporate reorganization in july 2009 to become an irish public limited company these reorganizations exposed us and our shareholders to the risks described below in addition we cannot be assured that all of the anticipated benefits of the reorganizations will be realized 

changes in tax laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under us or nonus tax laws or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

 11 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our reorganizations could be impacted by changes in tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the us tax authorities or nonus tax authorities from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for instance recent us legislative proposals would broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident for us tax purposes which would significantly diminish the realization of any tax benefit related to our reorganizations there are other recent us legislative proposals that could modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position moreover other us legislative proposals could have a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments by our us subsidiaries to our nonus affiliates which could increase our tax liability we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation in any jurisdiction 

while we monitor proposals that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax law is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding the ireland reorganization limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

while our us operations are subject to us tax we believe that a significant portion of our nonus operations are generally not subject to us tax other than withholding taxes the irs or a court however may not concur with our conclusions including our determination that we and a significant number of our foreign subsidiaries are not controlled foreign corporations cfc within the meaning of the us tax laws a contrary determination which could also arise through significant future acquisitions of our stock by us persons could also potentially cause us holders direct indirect or constructive owners of 10 or more of our stock or the voting stock of our nonus subsidiaries to include in their gross income their pro rata share of certain of our and our nonus subsidiary income for the period during which we and our nonus subsidiaries were a cfc in addition gain or a portion of such gain realized on cfc shares sold by such shareholders may be treated as ordinary income depending on certain facts treatment of us or any of our nonus subsidiaries as a cfc could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

as described further in “legal proceedings” we have received several notices from the irs containing proposed adjustments to our tax filings in connection with audits of the 20012006 tax years the irs has not contested the validity of our reincorporation in bermuda in any of these notices we have and intend to continue to vigorously contest all of these proposed adjustments 

although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty based upon an analysis of the merits of our position we believe that we are adequately reserved for these matters and do not expect that the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition or cash flows as we move forward to resolve these matters with the irs the reserves established may be adjusted although we continue to contest the irss position there can be no assurance that we will be successful if the irss position with respect to 20022006 is ultimately sustained we would be required to record additional charges and the resulting liability will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

although we expect them to do so at this time the irs has not yet proposed any similar adjustments for years subsequent to 2006 as the federal income tax audits for those years are still in process or have not yet begun it is unclear how the irs will apply its position to subsequent years or whether the irs will take a similar position in future audits with respect to intercompany debt instruments not outstanding in prior years 

the inability to realize any anticipated tax benefits related to our reorganizations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

legislative and regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us 

the us federal government and various states and municipalities have enacted or may enact legislation intended to deny government contracts to us companies that reincorporate outside of the us or have reincorporated outside of the us 

for instance the homeland security act of 2002 as amended includes a provision that prohibits “inverted domestic corporations” and their subsidiaries from entering into contracts with the department of homeland security in addition the state of california adopted legislation intended to limit the eligibility of certain nonus chartered companies to participate in certain state contracts more recently the 20082014 consolidated appropriations acts prohibit any federal government agency from using funds appropriated by congress for fiscal years 20082014 to pay an inverted domestic corporation or any of its subsidiaries for work performed or products provided under certain federal contracts “affected contracts” although the amount of monies already 

 12 

paid to us or to be paid to us under the affected contracts is not material to the company we cannot provide any assurance that the impact of future actions taken by the government in this area will not be materially adverse to our operations 

in addition there continues to be negative publicity regarding and criticism of companies that conduct business in the united states and in other countries but have changed their place of incorporation to another country 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities   

the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemptive rights with respect to any particular allotment of shares under irish law these authorizations must be renewed by the shareholders every five years and we cannot guarantee that these authorizations will always be approved recently certain proxy advisory firms are taking the position that irish companies should limit these authorizations in terms of the number of authorized but unissued shares that can be issued without shareholder approval the number of shares that can be issued without preemptive rights and the duration of the authorizations if we are required to limit these authorizations in order to obtain shareholder approval we will be limited in our ability to issue shares in ways that us companies are not limited and will need to renew the authorizations even more frequently than the fiveyear period provided under irish law 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax   

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders resident in the united states will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could have an adverse impact on the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax   

dividends paid in respect of our shares will generally not be subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in irireland 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in irireland

the majority of our plant facilities are owned by us with the remainder under longterm lease arrangements we believe that our plants have been well maintained are generally in good condition and are suitable for the conduct of our business 

 13 

the locations by segment of our principal plant facilities at december 31 2013  were as follows 








 item 3      legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we are involved in a variety of lawsuits claims and legal proceedings including commercial and contract disputes employment matters product liability claims asbestosrelated claims environmental liabilities intellectual property disputes and taxrelated matters in our opinion pending legal matters are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition liquidity or cash flows 

tax related matters 

in 2007 we received a notice from the irs containing proposed adjustments to our tax filings in connection with an audit of the 2001 and 2002 tax years the irs did not contest the validity of our reincorporation in bermuda the irs proposed to ignore the entities that hold the intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in bermuda the “2001 debt” and to which the interest was paid and impose 30 withholding tax on a portion of the interest payments as if they were made directly to a company that was not eligible for reduced us withholding tax under a us income tax treaty the irs asserted that we owe additional taxes with respect to 2002 of approximately 840 million  plus interest we strongly disagreed with the view of the irs and filed a protest in 2010 we received an amended notice from the irs assessing penalties of 30  on the asserted underpayment of tax described above 

 14 

we have so far been unsuccessful in resolving this dispute and recently received a notice of deficiency from the irs for 2002 the company filed a petition in the united states tax court in november 2013 contesting this deficiency in its january 2014 answer to our petition the irs asserted that we also owe 30  withholding tax on the portion of 2002 interest payments made on the 2001 debt upon which it did not previously assert withholding tax a 30  withholding tax on this 850 million  interest payment would increase the total tax liability proposed for 2002 to 1090 million   840 million  referred to in the paragraph above plus this additional 250 million  plus 30  penalties and interest 

recently we received notices from the irs containing proposed adjustments to the companys tax filings in connection with an audit of the 20032006 tax years in these notices the irs asserts that we owe a total of approximately 6650 million  of additional taxes as described more fully below in connection with our interest payments on the 2001 debt for the 20032006 period plus penalties and interest on these unpaid taxes 

 the irs continues to take the position on the 2001 debt which was retired at the end of 2011 that it previously took for our 2002 tax year and which is described above as a result of this recharacterization the irs asserts that we owe approximately 4550 million  of withholding tax for 20032006 plus 30  penalties 

the irs also proposes to extend its position further and to treat all of the interest income from the 2001 debt as creating earnings and profits at irlimited and as a result recharacterize the distributions made by irlimited during the 20022006 tax years as taxable dividends instead of as a return of capital consequently the irs asserts that we owe approximately 2100 million  of income tax on these dividends plus penalties of 20  

although we expect it to do so the irs has not yet proposed any similar adjustments for years subsequent to 2006 as the federal income tax audits for those years are still in process or have not yet begun in addition we do not know how the irs will apply its position to the different facts presented in those years or whether the irs will take a similar position in future audits with respect to intercompany debt instruments not outstanding in prior years 

we have vigorously contested all of these proposed adjustments and intend to continue to do so although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty based upon an analysis of the merits of our position we believe that we are adequately reserved under the applicable accounting standards for these matters and do not expect that the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition or cash flows as we move forward to resolve these matters with the irs the reserves established may be adjusted although we continue to contest the irss position there can be no assurance that we will be successful if the irss position with respect to the 20022006 tax years is ultimately sustained we would be required to record additional charges and the resulting liability will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows

asbestosrelated matters 

certain whollyowned subsidiaries of the company are named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in state and federal courts in virtually all of the suits a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants the vast majority of those claims have been filed against either irnew jersey or trane and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by irnew jersey or trane primarily pumps boilers and railroad brake shoes neither irnew jersey nor trane was a producer or manufacturer of asbestos however some formerly manufactured products utilized asbestoscontaining components such as gaskets and packings purchased from thirdparty suppliers

overview 

organization 

we are a diversified global company that provides products services and solutions to enhance the quality and comfort of air in homes and buildings transport and protect food and perishables and increase industrial productivity and efficiency our business segments consist of climate and industrial both with strong brands and leading positions within their respective markets we generate revenue and cash primarily through the design manufacture sale and service of a diverse portfolio of industrial and commercial products that include wellrecognized premium brand names such as trane ®  ingersollrand ®  thermo king ®  american standard ® and club car ®  

to achieve our mission of being a world leader in creating comfortable and efficient environments we continue to focus on increasing our recurring revenue stream from parts service used equipment and rentals and to continuously improve the efficiencies and capabilities of the products and services of our highpotential businesses we also continue to focus on operational excellence strategies as a central theme to improving our earnings and cash flows 

trends and economic events 

we are a global corporation with worldwide operations as a global business our operations are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic factors as well as political factors wherever we operate or do business our geographic and industry diversity as well as the diversity of our product sales and services has helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results 

given the broad range of products manufactured and geographic markets served management uses a variety of factors to predict the outlook for the company we monitor key competitors and customers in order to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future in addition our order rates are indicative of future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance in those industry segments where we are a capital equipment provider revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy 

current market conditions including challenges in international markets continue to impact our financial results uneven global commercial new construction activity is negatively impacting the results of our commercial heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac business however we believe the commercial hvac equipment replacement and aftermarket is slowly recovering we have seen slower worldwide industrial equipment and aftermarket activity while us residential and consumer markets continue to be a challenge we continue to see improvements in the us new builder and replacement markets the residential hvac business also continues to be impacted by a mix shift to units with a lower seasonal energy efficiency rating seer as economic conditions stabilize we expect slight revenue growth along with benefits from restructuring and productivity programs 

despite the current market environment we believe we have a solid foundation of global brands and leading market shares in all of our major product lines our growing geographic and industry diversity coupled with our large installed product base provides growth opportunities within our service parts and replacement revenue streams in addition we are investing substantial resources to innovate and develop new products and services which we expect will drive our future growth

see “discontinued operations and divestitures” within managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and also note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our discontinued operations 

senior notes due 2019 2023 and 2043 

in june 2013 we issued 155 billion principal amount of senior notes in three tranches through our whollyowned subsidiary ingersollrand global holding company limited irglobal pursuant to rule 144a of the us securities act of 1933 securities act the tranches consist of 350 million of 2875 senior notes due in 2019 700 million of 4250 senior notes due in 2023 and 500 million of 5750 senior notes due in 2043 the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of irireland ingersollrand company limited irlimited and ingersollrand international holding limited irinternational interest on the notes will be paid twice a year in arrears the company has the option to redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time and from time to time prior to their stated maturity date at redemption prices set forth in the indenture agreement the notes are subject to certain customary covenants however none of these covenants are considered restrictive to the company’s operations in connection with the issuance of each series of notes irglobal the guarantors and the initial purchasers of the notes entered into a registration rights agreement each registration rights agreement requires irglobal and the guarantors to use their commercially reasonable efforts to execute an effective exchange offer registration statement with the sec no later than 365 days after the closing date of the notes offering and to complete an exchange offer within 30 business days of such effective date if a registration default occurs additional interest shall accrue on the notes the proceeds from these notes were used to fund the july 2013 redemption of 600 million of 6000 senior notes due 2013 and 655 million of 9500 senior notes due 2014 and to fund expenses related to the spinoff of the commercial and residential security businesses with any remaining proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes related to this redemption the company recorded 456 million of premium expense in the third quarter of 2013 in interest expense 

irs exam results 

in 2007 we received a notice from the irs containing proposed adjustments to our tax filings in connection with an audit of the 2001 and 2002 tax years the irs did not contest the validity of our reincorporation in bermuda the irs proposed to ignore the entities that hold the intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in bermuda the “2001 debt” and to which the interest was paid and impose 30 withholding tax on a portion of the interest payments as if they were made directly to a company that was not eligible for reduced us withholding tax under a us income tax treaty the irs asserted that we owe additional taxes with respect to 2002 of approximately 84 million  plus interest we strongly disagreed with the view of the irs and filed a protest in 2010 we received an amended notice from the irs assessing penalties of 30  on the asserted underpayment of tax described above 

we have so far been unsuccessful in resolving this dispute and recently received a notice of deficiency from the irs for 2002 the company filed a petition in the united states tax court in november 2013 contesting this deficiency in its january 2014 answer to our petition the irs asserted that we also owe 30  withholding tax on the portion of 2002 interest payments made on the 2001 debt upon which it did not previously assert withholding tax a 30  withholding tax on this 850 million  interest payment would increase the total tax liability proposed for 2002 to 1090 million   84 million  referred to in the paragraph above plus this additional 250 million  plus 30  penalties and interest 

recently we received notices from the irs containing proposed adjustments to the companys tax filings in connection with an audit of the 20032006 tax years in these notices the irs asserts that we owe a total of approximately 6650 million  of additional taxes as described more fully below in connection with our interest payments on the 2001 debt for the 20032006 period plus penalties and interest on these unpaid taxes 

 the irs continues to take the position on the 2001 debt which was retired at the end of 2011 that it previously took for our 2002 tax year and which is described above as a result of this recharacterization the irs asserts that we owe approximately 4550 million  of withholding tax for 20032006 plus 30  penalties 

 22 

the irs also proposes to extend its position further and to treat all of the interest income from the 2001 debt as creating earnings and profits at irlimited and as a result recharacterize the distributions made by irlimited during the 20022006 tax years as taxable dividends instead of as a return of capital consequently the irs asserts that we owe approximately 2100 million  of income tax on these dividends plus penalties of 20  

although we expect it to do so the irs has not yet proposed any similar adjustments for years subsequent to 2006 as the federal income tax audits for those years are still in process or have not yet begun in addition we do not know how the irs will apply its position to the different facts presented in those years or whether the irs will take a similar position in future audits with respect to intercompany debt instruments not outstanding in prior years 

we have vigorously contested all of these proposed adjustments and intend to continue to do so although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty based upon an analysis of the merits of our position we believe that we are adequately reserved under the applicable accounting standards for these matters and do not expect that the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition or cash flows as we move forward to resolve these matters with the irs the reserves established may be adjusted although we continue to contest the irss position there can be no assurance that we will be successful if the irss position with respect to the 20022006 tax years is ultimately sustained we would be required to record additional charges and the resulting liability will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows

net revenues 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2013  increased by 30  or  3622 million  compared with the same period of 2012  which primarily resulted from the following 



the increase in revenues was primarily driven by volume improvements within the climate segment and improved pricing for both climate and industrial 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2012  decreased by 61  or  7725 million  compared with the same period of 2011  which primarily resulted from the following 



the decrease in revenues was primarily driven by the absence of hussmann for the year ended december 31 2012 which contributed  8185 million  of revenue in the same period in 2011 this decrease was partially offset by improved pricing within both of our segments and higher volumes within the industrial business segment 

operating incomemargin 

operating margin remained flat at 89  for the year ended december 31 2013  and 2012  during 2013 we experienced improved pricing in excess of material inflation 05 and productivity benefits in excess of other inflation 04 offset by increased 

 25 

investment and restructuring spending 09 during 2013  and 2012  the company incurred costs of 823 million  and 233 million  respectively associated with ongoing restructuring actions these actions included workforce reductions as well as the closure and consolidation of manufacturing facilities in an effort to improve the companys cost structure 

operating margin improved to 89  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to 34  for the same period of 2011  the improvement was primarily due to operating income in 2011 including a 6469 million loss on saleasset impairment charge related to the divestiture of hussmann 51 improved pricing in excess of material inflation across 13 and the realization of productivity benefits in excess of other inflation 09 these improvements were partially offset by increased investment and restructuring spending 13 and unfavorable product mix and volume 09 

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013  increased by  268 million  compared with the same period of 2012  primarily as a result of the redemption premium expense incurred during the july 2013 debt redemption discussed in liquidity and capital resources 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2012  decreased  265 million  compared with the same period of 2011  as a result of lower average debt balances in 2012  

other net 

the components of other net for the year ended december 31  are as follows 



exchange gain loss for the year ended december 31 2013  includes a loss of approximately 38 million  related to the devaluation of the venezuela bolivar included within earnings loss from equity investments for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  is  26 million   59 million  and  35 million  of equity loss respectively on the hussmann equity investment incurred subsequent to the hussmann divestiture transaction dates the activity included within other for the year ended december 31 2012  is primarily related to adjustments to actual and expected insurance recoveries as a result of a settlement 

provision for income taxes 

the 2013 effective tax rate was 228 the 2013 effective tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to earnings in nonus jurisdictions which in aggregate have a lower effective rate and a 36 million net reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits primarily due to the settlement of an audit in a major tax jurisdiction partially offset by a tax charge of 51 million as a result of a change in assertion in certain subsidiary earnings that the company has previously determined to be permanently reinvested and approximately 74 million of allegion spinoff tax charges primarily related to a net increase in our valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets revenues from nonus jurisdictions account for approximately 41 of our total revenues such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the us at rates ranging from 0 to 38 when comparing the results of multiple reporting periods among other factors the mix of earnings between us and foreign jurisdictions can cause variability on our overall effective tax rate 

the 2012 effective tax rate was 66 which included a tax benefit of approximately 1400 million resulting from a reduction in valuation allowances on certain nonus deferred tax assets the 2012 effective tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate of 350 primarily due to earnings in nonus jurisdictions which in aggregate have a lower effective rate and a reduction in valuation allowances mentioned above partially offset by a net increase in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits

review of business segments 

the segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment included in continuing operations 

in the fourth quarter of 2013 the company realigned its organizational structure to provide a greater focus on growth continue implementation of business operating systems build on our successful operational excellence philosophy and reduce complexity and costs the company’s new reporting structure includes the climate and industrial segments 

 26 

segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for performance reviews compensation and resource allocation for these reasons we believe that segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss we may exclude certain charges or gains from operating income to arrive at a segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base our operating decisions we define segment operating margin as segment operating income as a percentage of net revenues

liquidity and capital resources 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income in jurisdictions where it is deemed to be permanently reinvested our most promin ent jurisdiction of operation is the us other than as discussed below we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate funds to the us and no provision for us income taxes has been made with respect to such earnings we expect existing cash and cash equivalents available to the us the cash generated by our us operations our committed credit lines as well as our expected ability to access the capital and debt markets will be sufficient to fund our us operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future in addition we expect existing nonus cash and cash equivalents and the cash generated by our nonus operations will be sufficient to fund our nonus operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our us operations and we determine that repatriation of nonus cash is necessary such amounts would be subject to us federal income taxes 

as a result of the allegion spinoff and certain internal restructurings the company believes it is advantageous to fully repay an intercompany debt obligation between two of its subsidiaries in order to facilitate the repayment of this intercompany debt in the fourth quarter of 2013 the company decided to change its permanent reinvestment assertion as it relates to approximately 740 million of earnings primarily related to subsidiaries in hong kong australia and canada the company has recorded the tax effects of this change in the fourth quarter of 2013 which resulted in a charge of approximately 51 million except where otherwise noted the company continues with its permanent reinvestment assertion on its remaining unremitted earnings for a further discussion see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

during 2013 we repurchased 208 million  shares for  12 billion  excluding commissions under our current share repurchase program these repurchases were accounted for as a reduction of ordinary shares and capital in excess of par value as they were canceled upon repurchase 

in february 2014 we announced an increase in our quarterly share dividend from 021  to 025  per share beginning with our march 2014 payment the dividend is payable march 31 2014 to shareholders of record on march 14 2014 in february 2014 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15 billion  of our ordinary shares under a new share repurchase program upon completion of the current share repurchase program the new share repurchase program is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2014 we expect our available cash flow committed credit lines and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to fund the increased dividend and share repurchases

liquidity 

the following table contains several key measures to gauge our financial condition and liquidity at the periods ended december 31 



shortterm borrowings and current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 consisted of the following 



commercial paper program 

the maximum aggregate amount of unsecured commercial paper notes available to be issued on a private placement basis under the commercial paper program is  2 billion  as of december 31 2013  under the commercial paper program ingersollrand global holding company limited irglobal may issue notes from time to time and the proceeds of the financing will be used for general corporate purposes each of irireland ingersollrand company limited irlimited and ingersollrand international holding limited irinternational has provided an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee for the notes issued under the commercial paper program we had no  commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  

debentures with put feature 

at december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  we had outstanding 3430 million  and  3430 million  respectively of fixed rate debentures which only require early repayment at the option of the holder these debentures contain a put feature that the holders may exercise on each anniversary of the issuance date subject to a notice requirement if exercised we are obligated to repay in whole or in part at the holder’s option the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of the debentures held by the holder if these options are not exercised the final maturity dates would range between 2027  and 2028  

holders of these debentures had the option to exercise the put feature on  372 million  of the outstanding debentures in february 2013 subject to the notice requirement no exercises were made holders of the remaining  3058 million  of the outstanding debentures had the option to exercise the put feature subject to the notice requirement on the remaining  3058 million  in outstanding debentures in november 2013 no material exercises were made holders of these debentures had the option to exercise the put feature on 372 million  of the outstanding debentures in february 2014 subject to the notice requirement no notifications were received based on our cash flow forecast and access to the capital markets we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to repay any amounts exercised as a result of the put features 

senior notes due 2019 2023 and 2043 

in june 2013 we issued 155 billion principal amount of senior notes in three tranches through our whollyowned subsidiary irglobal pursuant to rule 144a of the securities act the tranches consist of 350 million of 2875 senior notes due in 2019 700 million of 4250 senior notes due in 2023 and 500 million of 5750 senior notes due in 2043 in connection with the issuance of each series of notes irglobal the guarantors and the initial purchasers of the notes entered into a registration rights agreement each registration rights agreement requires irglobal and the guarantors to use their commercially reasonable efforts to execute an effective exchange offer registration statement with the sec no later than 365 days after the closing date of the notes offering and to complete an exchange offer within 30 business days of such effective date if a registration default occurs additional interest shall accrue on the notes the proceeds from these notes were used to fund the july 2013 redemption of 600 million of 6000 senior notes due 2013 and 655 million of 9500 senior notes due 2014 and to fund expenses related to the spinoff of the commercial and residential security businesses with any remaining proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes 

 32 

in july 2013 we fully redeemed the outstanding principal amount of 600 million of our 6000 senior notes due 2013 and 655 million of our 9500 senior notes due 2014 resulting in 456 million of redemption premium expense which was recorded in the third quarter of 2013 in interest expense 

exchangeable senior notes due 2012 

in april 2009 we issued  345 million  of 45  exchangeable senior notes the notes through our whollyowned subsidiary irglobal we settled all remaining outstanding notes during 2012 as a result we paid  3570 million  in cash and issued 108 million  ordinary shares to settle the principal interest and equity portion of the notes 

other 

as of december 31 2013 we have a a 4year 10 billion  revolving credit facility maturing on may 20 2015  and a 5year  10 billion  revolving credit facility maturing on march 15 2017  through our whollyowned subsidiary irglobal

in addition other available nonus lines of credit were  9073 million  of which  6600 million  was unused at december 31 2013  these lines provide support for bank guarantees letters of credit and other general corporate purposes 

pension plans 

our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due we seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities we use a dynamic approach to asset allocation whereby a plans allocation to fixed income assets increases progressively over time towards an ultimate target of 90 as a plan moves toward full funding we monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance 

we monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis none of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to the volatility in the markets for further details on pension plan activity see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

cash flows 

the following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended december 31 respectively for additional details please see the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was  8777 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared with  8681 million  in 2012  operating cash flows for 2013 reflect consistent earnings from continuing operations after taking into account spinrelated tax charges with no cash impact in 2013 and favorable changes in working capital management 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was  8681 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared with  7863 million  in 2011  operating cash flows for 2012 and 2011 reflect consistent working capital levels and consistent earnings from continuing operations after taking into account the noncash loss on saleasset impairment charges related to the hussmann divestiture 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was  2132 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared with  1282 million  in 2012  the change in investing activities is primarily attributable to increased capital expenditures and decreased net proceeds from business dispositions and equity investments in 2013 compared to 2012 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was  1282 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared with net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations of  2298 million  in 2011  the change in investing activities is primarily attributable to decreased net proceeds from business dispositions and sale of property plant and equipment in 2012 compared to 2011 partially offset by a 443 million  dividend from the companys equity investment in hussmann parent in 2012 during 2011 the company received net proceeds from business dispositions of 4003 million related to the sale of the 

 33 

hussmann business and branches and the collection of proceeds for purchase price adjustments on the sale of doosan infracore during 2011 we also received proceeds from the sale of assets from a restructured business in china 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended december 31 2013  was  3541 million  compared with net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations of  12957 million  in 2012  the change in financing activities is primarily related to net proceeds from refinancing of our long term debt in 2013 and a transfer of 12742 million from allegion in connection with the spinoff  partially offset by increased repurchase of ordinary shares in 2013 

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended december 31 2012  was  12957 million  compared with  12398 million  during 2011  the change in financing activities is primarily related to the settlement of the exchangeable senior notes and increased dividend payments during 2012 partially offset by decreased share repurchases and increased proceeds from shares issued under incentive plans in 2012 

capital resources 

based on historical performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance the cash generated from our operations our committed credit lines and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures share repurchase programs upcoming debt maturities and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the foreseeable future 

capital expenditures were  2422 million   2431 million  and  2171 million  for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively our investments continue to improve manufacturing productivity reduce costs and provide environmental enhancements and advanced technologies for existing facilities the capital expenditure program for 2014  is estimated to be approximately 250 million including amounts approved in prior periods many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at our option without incurring substantial charges 

for financial market risk impacting the company see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

capitalization 

in addition to cash on hand and operating cash flow we maintain significant credit availability under our commercial paper program our ability to borrow at a costeffective rate under the commercial paper program is contingent upon maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating as of december 31 2013  our credit ratings were as follows 



the credit ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

our public debt does not contain financial covenants and our revolving credit lines have a debttototal capital covenant of 65 as of december 31 2013  our debttototal capital ratio was significantly beneath this limit 

guarantees 

subsequent to our reorganization as an irish plc irireland and irlimited guaranteed fully and unconditionally the outstanding public debt of irinternational irglobal and irnew jersey during 2013 irglobal and irinternational public outstanding indentures were modified to include irnew jersey as a coobligor 

 34 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment periods in millions 



 includes 343 million of debt redeemable at the option of the holder the scheduled maturities of these bonds range between 2027 and 2028 see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above 

pensions 

at december 31 2013  we had net obligations of  5540 million  which consist of noncurrent pension assets of  43 million  and current and noncurrent pension benefit liabilities of  5583 million  it is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required we currently project that we will contribute approximately  1541 million  to our plans worldwide in 2014  because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for pension obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

postretirement benefits other than pensions 

at december 31 2013  we had postretirement benefit obligations of  7133 million  we fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a payasyougo basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations benefit payments which are net of expected plan participant contributions and medicare part d subsidy are expected to be approximately  666 million  in 2014  because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for postretirement obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income taxes 

at december 31 2013  we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of  3633 million  and  719 million  of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax the liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits and internal revenue service irs tax disputes 

contingent liabilities 

we are involved in various litigations claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

see note 8 and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on matters affecting our liquidity 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

 35 

 recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test included in us gaap for those reporting units where it is required the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a second step is performed wherein the reporting units carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value impairment exists and must be recognized 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is based on two valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model income approach and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues market approach with each method being equally weighted in the calculation we believe an equal weighting of both approaches is appropriate the income approach relies on the companys estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing growth and margins with due consideration given to forecasting risk the market approach reflects the markets expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publicly traded companies and the subject reporting units 

in step 2 the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit 

recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is first assessed using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired this assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset for those indefinitelived assets where it is required a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology income approach which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess 

the determination of the estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows including profit margins longterm forecasts discount rates and terminal growth rates we developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit 

2013 impairment test 

for our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2013 we concluded it was necessary to calculate the fair value for each of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangibles based on the results of these calculations we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

 36 

goodwill   under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 100  to 155  near term growth rates ranging from 02  to 87  and terminal growth rates ranging from 30  to 40  under the market approach we used an adjusted multiple ranging from 72  to 98  of projected earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and 09  to 24  of projected revenues based on the market information of comparable companies additionally we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization 

for all reporting units the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 15 a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units 

in our 2012 form 10k we disclosed a security technologies reporting unit whose excess estimated fair value over carrying value was less than 15 as a result of the spinoff beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013 this reporting unit is now presented within discontinued operations please see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment charges related to discontinued operations 

other indefinitelived intangible assets   in testing our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 105 to 120 terminal growth rate of 30 and royalty rates ranging from 30 to 45 for all tradenames the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 15 

a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our tradenames 

2012 impairment test 

for our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2012 we concluded it was necessary to calculate the fair value for each of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangibles based on the results of these calculations we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

goodwill   under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 110  to 155  near term growth rates ranging from 35  to 145  and terminal growth rates ranging from 25  to 40  under the market approach we used an adjusted multiple ranging from 66  to 92  of projected earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and 08  to 18  of projected revenues based on the market information of comparable companies additionally we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization 

for all reporting units except one the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 15  the reporting unit with a percentage of carrying value less than 15 reported within the climate segment exceeded its carrying value by 144  this reporting unit had goodwill of approximately  599 million  at december 31 2012 a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units 

other indefinitelived intangible assets   in testing our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 120 to 125 terminal growth rates ranging from 25 to 30 and royalty rates ranging from 30 to 40 the fair values of our trane and american standard tradenames exceeded their respective carrying amounts by less than 15 the two tradenames exceeded their carrying value by 105 and 130 respectively the carrying values of these tradenames are approximately 2497 million and 105 million respectively at december 31 2012 

a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our tradenames 

  37 

value exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined by an estimate of discounted cash flows we believe that our use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to these valuations 

 we offer various sales incentive programs to our customers dealers and distributors sales incentive programs do not preclude revenue recognition but do require an accrual for the companys best estimate of expected activity examples of the sales incentives that are accrued for as a contra receivable and sales deduction at the point of sale include but are not limited to discounts ie net 30 type coupons and rebates where the customer does not have to provide any additional requirements to receive the discount sales returns and customer disputes involving a question of quantity or price are also accounted for as a reduction in revenue and a contra receivable at december 31 2013 and 2012 the company had a customer claim accrual contra receivable of 17 million  and 21 million  respectively all other incentives or incentive programs where the customer is required to reach a certain sales level remain a customer for a certain period of time provide a rebate form or is subject to additional requirements are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and establishment of a liability at december 31 2013 and 2012 the company had a sales incentive accrual of 801 million  and 622 million  respectively each of these accruals represents the best estimate the company expects to pay related to previously sold units these estimates are reviewed regularly for accuracy if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

the company enters into maintenance and extended warranty contracts with customers revenue related to these services is recognized on a straightline basis over the life of the contract unless sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of providing these services is incurred on an other than straightline basis in these circumstances revenue is recognized over the contract period in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing the service 

 38 

the company primarily through its climate segment provides equipment eg hvac controls integrated solutions and installation designed to customer specifications through constructiontype contracts the term of these types of contracts is typically less than one year but can be as long as three years revenues related to these contracts are recognized using the percentageofcompletion method in accordance with gaap this measure of progress toward completion utilized to recognize sales and profits is based on the proportion of actual cost incurred to date as compared to the total estimate of contract costs at completion the timing of revenue recognition often differs from the invoicing schedule to the customer with revenue recognition in advance of customer invoicing recorded to unbilled accounts receivable and invoicing in advance of revenue recognition recorded to deferred revenue at december 31 2013  all recorded receivables billed and unbilled are due within one year the company reevaluates its contract estimates periodically and reflects changes in estimates in the current period using the cumulative catchup method these periodic reviews have not historically resulted in significant adjustments if estimated contract costs are in excess of contract revenues then the excess costs are accrued 

we enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple elements such as equipment installation and service revenue for multiple element arrangements each element is evaluated to determine the separate units of accounting the total arrangement consideration is then allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price at the inception of the arrangement the relative selling price is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if it exists otherwise thirdparty evidence tpe of selling price is used if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable a best estimate of the selling price is developed for that deliverable the company primarily utilizes vsoe to determine its relative selling price the company recognizes revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has standalone value to the customer the basic revenue recognition criteria have been met and only customary refund or return rights related to the delivered elements exist 

 the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 

  39 

changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the expected 2014 net periodic pension cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 50 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately 68 million a 025 rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would decrease expected 2014 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by 05 million and a 10 increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the service and interest cost by approximately 12 million

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world we actively manage material currency exposures that are associated with purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities at the operating unit level those exposures that cannot be naturally offset to an insignificant amount are hedged with foreign currency derivatives derivative instruments utilized by us in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2013  a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an unrealized loss of approximately  1078 million  as compared with  974 million  at december 31 2012  these amounts when realized would be offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2013  

interest rate exposure 

our debt portfolio mainly consists of fixedrate instruments and therefore any fluctuation in market interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations

products and services 

our principal products and services by business segment include the following 









these products are sold primarily under our name and under other names including american standard aro cisa club car lcn schlage thermo king von duprin and trane 

competitive conditions 

our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world due to the diversity of these products and services and the variety of markets served we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line and services they include wellestablished regional or specialized competitors as well as larger us and nonus corporations or divisions of larger companies 

the principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price quality delivery service and support technology and innovation we believe that we are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of hvac systems and services air compression systems transport temperature control products air tools and golf and utility vehicles in addition we believe we are a leading supplier in us markets for architectural hardware products mechanical locks and electronic and biometric accesscontrol technologies 

distribution 

our products are distributed by a number of methods which we believe are appropriate to the type of product us sales are made through branch sales offices and through distributors dealers and large retailers across the country nonus sales are made through numerous subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world 

customers 

we have no customer that accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues in 2012  2011  or 2010  no material part of our business is dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers therefore the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

raw materials 

we manufacture many of the components included in our products which requires us to employ a wide variety of commodities principal commodities such as steel copper and aluminum are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world in the past higher prices for some commodities particularly steel and nonferrous metals have caused pricing pressures in some of our businesses we have historically been able to pass certain of these cost increases on to customers in the form of price increases 

we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future there have been no commodity shortages which have had a material adverse effect on our businesses however significant changes in certain material costs may have an adverse impact on our costs and operating margins to mitigate this potential impact we enter into longterm supply contracts in order to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions 

working capital 

we manufacture products that usually must be readily available to meet our customers’ rapid delivery requirements therefore we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs and our customers’ requirements such working capital requirements are not however in the opinion of management materially different from those experienced by our major competitors we believe our sales and payment terms are competitive in and appropriate for the markets in which we compete 

seasonality 

demand for certain segments of our products and services is influenced by weather conditions for instance tranes sales have historically tended to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because in the us and other northern hemisphere markets summer is the peak season for sales of air conditioning systems and services therefore results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unexpected cool trends or unseasonably warm trends during the summer season could negatively or positively affect certain segments of our business and impact overall results of operations 

research and development 

we engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products enhance existing product effectiveness increase safety improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate in addition we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment or acquisition we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development activities as we look to maintain and improve our competitive position research and development expenditures were approximately  2736 million  in 2012   2573 million  in 2011  and  2440 million  in 2010  

patents and licenses 

we own numerous patents and patent applications and are licensed under others although in aggregate we consider our patents and licenses to be valuable to our operations we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single patent or license or any group of them in our opinion engineering production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our patents andor licenses 

operations by geographic area 

more than 40  of our 2012  net revenues were derived outside the us and we sold products in more than 100 countries therefore the attendant risks of manufacturing or selling in a particular country such as nationalization and establishment of common markets may have an adverse impact on our nonus operations for a discussion of risks associated with our nonus operations see “risk factors – our global operations subject us to economic risks” and “risk factors – currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results” in item 1a and “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in item 7a 

backlog 

our approximate backlog of orders believed to be firm at december 31  was as follows 

  

these backlog figures are based on orders received while the major portion of our products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock orders for specialized machinery or specific customer application are submitted with extensive lead times and are often subject to revision deferral cancellation or termination we expect to ship substantially all the december 31 2012  backlog during 2013  

environmental matters 

we continue to be dedicated to an environmental program intended to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process as well as to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the environmental protection agency and similar state authorities we have been also identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future 

we incurred  45 million   31 million  and 10 million  of expenses during the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us as of december 31 2012  and 2011  we have recorded reserves for environmental matters of  659 million  and  709 million  respectively of these amounts  473 million  and  513 million  respectively relate to remediation of sites previously disposed by us our total current environmental reserve at december 31 2012  and 2011  was  222 million  and  261 million  respectively given the evolving nature of environmental laws regulations and technology the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain 

for a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities see also part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental and asbestos matters as well as note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

asbestos matters 

certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries are named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in us state and federal courts in virtually all of the suits a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants the vast majority of those claims have been filed against either ingersollrand company irnew jersey or trane us inc trane and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by irnew jersey or trane primarily pumps boilers and railroad brake shoes neither irnew jersey nor trane was a producer or manufacturer of asbestos however some formerly manufactured products utilized asbestoscontaining components such as gaskets and packings purchased from thirdparty suppliers 

we incurred net costs after insurance recoveries of 44 million  101 million  and 188 million  during the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively related to the settlement and defense of asbestosrelated claims our total liability for asbestosrelated matters and our total asset for probable asbestosrelated insurance recoveries were 8795 million  and 3203 million  respectively as of december 31 2012  and 9383 million  and 3224 million  respectively as of december 31 2011  our total current liability for asbestosrelated matters and our total current asset for probable asbestosrelated insurance recoveries was 691 million  and 225 million  respectively as of december 31 2012  and 697 million  and 235 million  respectively as of december 31 2011

 item 1a  risk factors 

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to a number of risks that could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k the risks set forth below are those we consider most significant we face other risks however that we do not currently perceive to be material but could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from our expectations you should evaluate all risks before you invest in our securities if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted in that case the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including europe china brazil venezuela africa india and turkey these activities are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

 these risks could increase our cost of doing business internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations limit our ability to sell products in certain markets and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

we must develop and commercialize new products and services in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business the development and commercialization of new products and services require a significant investment of resources we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by the market failure to develop new products and services that are accepted by the market could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and long term credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategy including our new 2 billion share repurchase program and our commitment to refinance our shortterm debt maturities and raise additional borrowings 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

more than 40  of our 2012  net revenues were derived outside the us and we expect sales to nonus customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues although we enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to currency exchange fluctuations changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time may in some instances have a material impact on our results of operations because we do not hedge against all of our currency exposure our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations 

we also translate assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in nonus dollar currencies into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements based on the applicable exchange rates consequently fluctuations in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies could have a material impact on the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation asbestosrelated matters that cannot be predicted with certainty as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other contingencies may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any improper conduct could damage our reputation and subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects financial condition results of operations cash flows and the market value of our stock 

we may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate our business we are also investing in new information technology systems that are designed to continue improving our operations if these systems cease to function properly or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we currently rely on a single vendor for substantially all of our global information technology infrastructure and its failure to provide effective support for such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results 

we have outsourced substantially all of our global information technology infrastructure to a thirdparty service provider in order to achieve cost savings and efficiencies the service provider has initiated arbitration proceedings against us regarding the terms nature and performance of the information technology services agreement if the service provider does not perform or does not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected efficiencies and may have to incur additional costs to address failures in providing service by the service provider depending on the function involved such nonperformance failure to perform effectively or failures of service may lead to business disruptions processing inefficiencies or security breaches such disruptions inefficiencies or breaches could negatively impact our business operations results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our information technology infrastructure is important to our business and data security breaches or disruptions of such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results 

our information technology infrastructure is subject to cyber attacks and unauthorized security intrusions despite instituting security policies and business continuity plans our systems and networks may be vulnerable to system damage malicious attacks from hackers employee errors or misconduct viruses power and utility outages and other catastrophic events that could cause significant harm to our business by negatively impacting our business operations compromising the security of our proprietary information and exposing us to litigation that could adversely affect our reputation such events could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

commodity shortages and price increases and higher energy prices could adversely affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities particularly steel and nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows we do not currently use financial derivatives to hedge against this volatility while we use fixed price contracts to mitigate this exposure we expect any future hedging activity to seek to minimize nearterm volatility of the commodity prices which would not protect us from longterm commodity price increases 

additionally we are exposed to large fluctuations in the price of petroleumbased fuel due to the instability of current market prices higher energy costs increase our operating costs and the cost of shipping our products and supplying services to customers around the world consequently sharp price increases the imposition of taxes or an interruption of supply could cause us to lose the ability to effectively manage the risk of rising fuel prices and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

our operational excellence efforts may not achieve the improvements we expect 

we utilize a number of tools such as lean six sigma to improve operational efficiency and productivity implementation of new processes to our operations could cause disruptions and there is no assurance that all of our planned operational excellence projects will be fully implemented or if implemented will realize the expected improvements 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

at december 31 2012  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled  61 billion  and  26 billion  respectively in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairments to goodwill or other indefinitelived assets any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the periods recognized 

changes in weather patterns and seasonal fluctuations may adversely affect certain segments of the companys business and impact overall results of operations 

demand for certain segments of the companys products and services is influenced by weather conditions for instance tranes sales have historically tended to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because in the us and other northern hemisphere markets summer is the peak season for sales of air conditioning systems and services therefore results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unexpected cool trends or unseasonably warm trends during the summer season could negatively or positively affect certain segments of the companys business and impact overall results of operations 

continued weakness in the commercial and residential construction markets may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

our commercial and residential hvac and security businesses which collectively represent 66 of our net revenues provide products and services to a wide range of markets including significant sales to the commercial and residential construction markets weakness in either or both of these construction markets may negatively impact the demand for our products and services decrease in the demand for our products and services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including environmental and health and safety we have made and will be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations changes in current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services in addition our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties fines or other sanctions if we are unable to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 

if the distribution of wabcos shares by trane on july 31 2007 were to fail to qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under section 355 of the internal revenue code the “code” then trane may be required to pay us federal income taxes 

trane received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of wabco shares to its shareholders qualified as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under section 355 of the code trane also received an opinion of skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp at the time of the distribution as to the taxfree nature of the transaction moreover in connection with our subsequent acquisition of trane we received an opinion of simpson thacher  bartlett llp substantially to the effect that the distribution should continue to qualify as taxfree to trane wabco and trane shareholders under section 355 and related provisions of the code the ruling and opinions were based on among other things certain assumptions as well as on the accuracy of certain factual representations and statements made by the company wabco and trane in rendering its ruling the irs also relied on certain covenants that trane and wabco entered into including the adherence to certain restrictions on wabcos and tranes future actions 

notwithstanding the private letter ruling or the opinions of counsel there can be no assurance that the irs will not later assert that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction if the wabco distribution is determined to be taxable we would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of i the fair market value of wabcos common stock distributed to the trane shareholders over ii tranes tax basis in such common stock we have a tax sharing agreement with wabco under which wabco would be responsible for all taxes imposed on trane as a result of the distribution except where taxes are imposed as a result of actions taken after the distribution by trane or any of its subsidiaries or shareholders if wabco was unable to satisfy its obligations under the tax sharing agreement or if trane was unable to rely on the tax sharing agreement for any reason any potential liability arising from the distribution of wabcos shares by trane could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to our proposed spinoff 

the proposed spinoff of our commercial and residential security businesses is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions may require significant time and attention of our management and may have an adverse effect on us even if not completed 

on december 10 2012 we announced our plan to spin off our commercial and residential security businesses the proposed spinoff is subject to various conditions is complex in nature and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions completion of the spinoff will be contingent upon customary conditions including receipt of regulatory approvals receipt of a ruling from the irs as to the taxfree nature of the spinoff as well as certain other matters relating to the spinoff receipt of legal opinions execution of intercompany agreements effectiveness of appropriate filings with the sec and final approval of the transactions contemplated by the spinoff as may be required under irish law for these and other reasons the spinoff transaction may not be completed as expected by the fourth calendar quarter of 2013 if at all 

even if the spinoff is not completed our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and we will be subject to certain risks and consequences including the following 

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and trading price 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoff 

although we believe that separating our commercial and residential security businesses by means of the spinoff will provide financial operational managerial and other benefits to us and our shareholders the spinoff may not provide the results on the scope or on the scale we anticipate and the assumed benefits of the spinoff may not be fully realized accordingly the spinoff might not provide us and our shareholders benefits or value in excess of the benefits and value that might have been created or realized had we retained the commercial and residential security businesses or undertaken another strategic alternative involving such businesses 

if the proposed spinoff of our commercial and residential security businesses is completed the trading price of our ordinary shares will decline and may experience greater volatility 

we expect the trading price of our ordinary shares immediately following the spinoff to be significantly lower than immediately prior to the spinoff because the trading price for our shares will no longer reflect the value of our commercial and residential security businesses in addition until the market has fully analyzed the companys value without our commercial and residential security businesses the price of our shares may experience greater volatility 

if the proposed spinoff is completed our shares may not match some holders investment strategies or meet minimum criteria for inclusion in stock market indices or portfolios which could cause investors to sell their shares excessive selling pressure could cause the market price of our shares to decrease further following the completion of the proposed spinoff 

following the spinoff the value of your ordinary shares in the company and the commercial and residential security businesses may collectively trade at an aggregate price less than that at which the companys ordinary shares might trade had the spinoff not occurred 

for a number of reasons the ordinary shares of the company and the commercial and residential security businesses that you may hold following the spinoff may collectively trade at a value significantly less than the price at which the companys ordinary shares might have traded had the spinoff not occurred and we continued to own the commercial and residential security businesses these reasons include the future performance of the company and the commercial and residential security businesses as separate independent companies and the future shareholder base and market for the companys ordinary shares and the shares of our commercial and residential security businesses and the prices at which these shares individually trade 

the proposed spinoff transaction could result in substantial tax liability 

we will request a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the spinoff and certain related transactions will qualify under sections 355 andor 368 of the code our receipt of the private letter ruling will be a condition to the completion of the spinoff if the factual assumptions or representations made in the private letter ruling request are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect then we will not be able to rely on the ruling furthermore the irs will not rule on whether a distribution such as the spinoff satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code rather the private letter ruling will be based on representations by us that those requirements have been satisfied and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling the spinoff will also be conditioned on our receipt of one or more opinions of outside advisors in form and substance satisfactory to us substantially to the effect that certain requirements including requirements that the irs will not rule on necessary to obtain tax free treatment have been satisfied such that the spinoff and certain related transactions should qualify under sections 355 368 and other provisions of the code the opinions will rely on among other things the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by each of the commercial and residential security businesses and us which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such advisors in their opinions the opinions will not be binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinions or that any such challenge would not prevail 

if notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinions the spinoff were determined to be a taxable transaction each us holder of our ordinary shares who receives shares of the commercial and residential security businesses in the spinoff would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of the new security company received that distribution would be taxable as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the applicable shareholders tax basis in our ordinary shares with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain in addition notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinions if the spinoff were determined to be a taxable transaction andor certain related internal transactions were to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment we could incur a substantial tax liability which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to our past reorganizations   

we effected a corporate reorganization in december 2001 to become a bermuda company the bermuda reorganization and a subsequent corporate reorganization in july 2009 to become an irish public limited company these reorganizations exposed us and our shareholders to the risks described below in addition we cannot be assured that all of the anticipated benefits of the reorganizations will be realized 

changes in tax laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under us or nonus tax laws or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our reorganizations could be impacted by changes in tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the us tax authorities or nonus tax authorities from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for instance recent us legislative proposals would broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident for us tax purposes which would significantly diminish the realization of any tax benefit related to our reorganizations there are other recent us legislative proposals that could modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position moreover other us legislative proposals could have a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments by our us subsidiaries to our nonus affiliates which could increase our tax liability we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation in any jurisdiction 

while we monitor proposals that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax law is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding the ireland reorganization limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

while our us operations are subject to us tax we believe that a significant portion of our nonus operations are generally not subject to us tax other than withholding taxes the irs or a court however may not concur with our conclusions including our determination that we and a significant number of our foreign subsidiaries are not currently controlled foreign corporations cfc within the meaning of the us tax laws a contrary determination which could also arise through significant future acquisitions of our stock by us persons could also potentially cause us holders direct indirect or constructive owners of 10 or more of our stock or the voting stock of our nonus subsidiaries to include in their gross income their pro rata share of certain of our and our nonus subsidiary income for the period during which we and our nonus subsidiaries were a cfc in addition gain or a portion of such gain realized on cfc shares sold by such shareholders may be treated as ordinary income depending on certain facts treatment of us or any of our nonus subsidiaries as a cfc could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

as described further in “legal proceedings” we have received several notices from the irs containing proposed adjustments to our tax filings in connection with an audit of the 20012002 tax years the irs has not contested the validity of our reincorporation in bermuda in any of these notices we have and intend to continue to vigorously contest these proposed adjustments 

although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty based upon an analysis of the merits of our position we believe that we are adequately reserved for this matter and do not expect that the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition or cash flows as we move forward to resolve this matter with the irs the reserves established may be adjusted although we continue to contest the irss position there can be no assurance that we will be successful if the irss position with respect to 2002 is ultimately sustained it will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

although we expect them to do so at this time the irs has not yet proposed any similar adjustments for years subsequent to 2002 as the federal income tax audits for those years are still in process or have not yet begun it is unclear how the irs will apply their position to subsequent years or whether the irs will take a similar position with respect to other intercompany debt instruments 

the inability to realize any anticipated tax benefits related to our reorganizations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

legislative and regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us 

the us federal government and various states and municipalities have enacted or may enact legislation intended to deny government contracts to us companies that reincorporate outside of the us or have reincorporated outside of the us 

for instance the homeland security act of 2002 as amended includes a provision that prohibits “inverted domestic corporations” and their subsidiaries from entering into contracts with the department of homeland security in addition the state of california adopted legislation intended to limit the eligibility of certain nonus chartered companies to participate in certain state contracts more recently the 2008 2009 and 2010 consolidated appropriations acts prohibit any federal government agency from using funds appropriated by congress for fiscal years 2008 2009 and 2010 to pay an inverted domestic corporation or any of its subsidiaries for work performed or products provided under certain federal contracts “affected contracts” although the amount of monies already paid to us or to be paid to us under the affected contracts is not material to the company we cannot provide any assurance that the impact of future actions taken by the government in this area will not be materially adverse to our operations 

in addition there continues to be negative publicity regarding and criticism of companies that conduct business in the united states and in other countries but have changed their place of incorporation to another country 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities   

the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the 

company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemptive rights with respect to any particular allotment of shares these authorizations must be renewed by the shareholders every five years and we cannot guarantee that these authorizations will always be approved 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax   

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders resident in the united states will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could have an adverse impact on the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax   

dividends paid in respect of our shares will generally not be subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in irireland 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in irireland

 item 2   properties 

as of december 31 2012  we owned or leased a total of approximately 17 million  square feet of space worldwide manufacturing and assembly operations are conducted in 63  plants across the world we also maintain various warehouses offices and repair centers throughout the world 

the majority of our plant facilities are owned by us with the remainder under longterm lease arrangements we believe that our plants have been well maintained are generally in good condition and are suitable for the conduct of our business 

the locations by segment of our principal plant facilities at december 31 2012  were as follows 












 item 3      legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we are involved in a variety of lawsuits claims and legal proceedings including commercial and contract disputes employment matters product liability claims asbestosrelated claims environmental liabilities intellectual property disputes and taxrelated matters in our opinion pending legal matters are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition liquidity or cash flows 

tax related matters 

in 2007 we received a notice from the irs containing proposed adjustments to our tax filings in connection with an audit of the 2001 and 2002 tax years the irs did not contest the validity of our reincorporation in bermuda the most significant adjustments proposed by the irs involve treating the entire intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in bermuda as equity as a result of this recharacterization the irs disallowed the deduction of interest paid on the debt and imposed dividend withholding taxes on the payments denominated as interest the irs also asserted an alternative argument to be applied if the intercompany debt is respected as debt in that circumstance the irs proposed to ignore the entities that hold the debt and to which the interest was paid and impose 30  withholding tax on a portion of the interest payments as if they were made directly to a company that was not eligible for reduced us withholding tax under a us income tax treaty the irs asserted under this alternative theory that we owe additional taxes with respect to 2002 of approximately  84 million  plus interest we strongly disagreed with the view of the irs and filed a protest with the irs 

in 2010 we received an amended notice from the irs eliminating its assertion that the intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in bermuda should be treated as equity however the irs continues to assert the alternative position described above and proposes adjustments to our 2002 tax filings if this alternative position is upheld the company would be required to record additional charges in addition the irs also provided notice that it is assessing penalties of 30  on the asserted underpayment of tax described above 

we have and intend to continue to vigorously contest these proposed adjustments we in consultation with our outside advisors carefully considered the form and substance of our intercompany financing arrangements including the actions necessary to qualify for the benefits of the applicable us income tax treaties we believe that these financing arrangements are in accordance with the laws of the relevant jurisdictions including the us that the entities involved should be respected and that the interest payments qualify for the us income tax treaty benefits claimed 

although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty based upon an analysis of the merits of our position we believe that we have adequately reserved for this matter and do not expect that the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition or cash flows as we move forward to resolve this matter with the irs the reserves established may be adjusted although we continue to contest the irss position there can be no assurance that we will be successful if the irss position with respect to 2002 is ultimately sustained it will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

although we expect them to do so at this time the irs has not yet proposed any similar adjustments for years subsequent to 2002 as the federal income tax audits for those years are still in process or have not yet begun it is unclear how the irs will apply their position to subsequent years or whether the irs will take a similar position with respect to other intercompany debt instruments

asbestosrelated matters 

certain whollyowned subsidiaries of the company are named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in state and federal courts in virtually all of the suits a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants the vast majority of those claims have been filed against either irnew jersey or trane us inc trane and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by irnew jersey or trane primarily pumps boilers and railroad brake

to achieve our mission of being a world leader in creating safe comfortable and efficient environments we continue to focus on increasing our recurring revenue stream from parts service used equipment and rentals and to continuously improve the efficiencies and capabilities of the products and services of our businesses we also continue to focus on operational excellence strategies as a central theme to improving our earnings and cash flows 

trends and economic events 

we are a global corporation with worldwide operations as a global business our operations are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic factors as well as political factors wherever we operate or do business our geographic and industry diversity as well as the diversity of our product sales and services has helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results 

given the broad range of products manufactured and geographic markets served management uses a variety of factors to predict the outlook for the company we monitor key competitors and customers in order to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future in addition our order rates are indicative of future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance in those industry segments where we are a capital equipment provider revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy 

current market conditions including challenges in international markets continue to impact our financial results the uneven commercial new construction activity in the united states and europe is negatively impacting the results of our security technologies segment and commercial heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac business however we believe the commercial hvac equipment replacement and aftermarket is slowly recovering we have seen moderate growth in the american and asian industrial markets and the north american refrigerated transport market while us residential and consumer markets continue to be a challenge as new singlefamily housing construction and consumer confidence remain at low levels we are beginning to see moderate improvements in the us new builder and replacement markets the residential hvac business also continues to be impacted by a mix shift to units with a lower seasonal energy efficiency rating seer as economic conditions stabilize we expect slight revenue growth along with benefits from restructuring and productivity programs 

despite the current market environment we believe we have a solid foundation of global brands and leading market shares in all of our major product lines our growing geographic and industry diversity coupled with our large installed product base provides growth opportunities within our service parts and replacement revenue streams in addition we are investing substantial resources to innovate and develop new products and services which we expect will drive our future growth

we expect the spinoff which is intended to be tax free to shareholders to be completed prior to yearend 2013 however the completion of the spinoff is subject to certain customary conditions including receipt of regulatory approvals receipt of a ruling from the us internal revenue service as to the taxfree nature of the spinoff as well as certain other matters relating to the spinoff receipt of legal opinions execution of intercompany agreements effectiveness of appropriate filings with the us securities and exchange commission and final approval of the transactions contemplated by the spinoff as may be required under irish law there can be no assurance that any separation transaction will ultimately occur or if one does occur its terms or timing

healthcare reform 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the healthcare and education reconciliation bill of 2010 collectively the healthcare reform legislation were signed into law as a result effective 2013 the tax benefits available to us are reduced to the extent our prescription drug expenses are reimbursed under the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy program although the provisions of the healthcare reform legislation relating to the retiree drug subsidy program did not take effect until 2013 we were required to recognize the full accounting impact in our financial statements in the reporting period in which the healthcare reform legislation was enacted as retiree healthcare liabilities and related tax impacts were already reflected in our financial statements the healthcare reform legislation resulted in a noncash charge to income tax expense in the first quarter of 2010 of  405 million  

currently our retiree medical plans receive the retiree drug subsidy under medicare part d no later than 2014 a significant portion of the drug coverage will be moved to a medicareapproved employer group waiver plan while retaining the same benefit provisions this change resulted in an actuarial gain which decreased our december 31 2010 retiree medical plan liability as well as the net actuarial losses in other comprehensive income by  411 million

the capital markets will be sufficient to fund our us operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future in addition we expect existing nonus cash and cash equivalents and the cash generated by our nonus operations will be sufficient to fund our nonus operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our us operations and we determine that repatriation of nonus cash is necessary such amounts would be subject to us federal income taxes

pension plans 

our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due we seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities prior to 2011 we utilized assetliability modeling studies as the basis for global asset allocation decisions in 2011 we adopted a dynamic approach to asset allocation whereby a plans allocation to fixed income assets increases progressively over time towards an ultimate target of 90 as a plan moves toward full funding we monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance 

we monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis during 2012  none of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to the volatility in the markets for further details on pension plan activity see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was  1464 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared with net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations of  2075 million  in 2011  the change in investing activities is primarily attributable to decreased net proceeds from business dispositions and sale of property plant and equipment in 2012 compared to 2011 partially offset by a 443 million  dividend from the companys equity investment in hussmann parent in 2012 during 2011 the company received net proceeds from business dispositions of 4003 million related to the sale of the hussmann business and branches and the collection of proceeds for purchase price adjustments on the sale of doosan infracore during 2011 we also received proceeds from the sale of assets from a restructured business in china 

net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was  2075 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared with net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations of  1790 million  in 2010  the change in investing activities is primarily attributable to net proceeds from business dispositions of 4003 million related to the sale of the hussmann business and branches and the collection of proceeds for purchase price adjustments on the sale of doosan infracore we also received proceeds from the sale of assets from a restructured business in china these proceeds were partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures during 2011 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended december 31 2012  was  13039 million  compared with  12464 million  during 2011  the change in financing activities is primarily related to the settlement of the exchangeable senior notes and increased dividend payments during 2012 partially offset by decreased share repurchases and increased proceeds from shares issued under incentive plans in 2012 

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended december 31 2011  was  12464 million  compared with  4037 million  during 2010  the change in financing activities is primarily related to approximately  12 billion  of share repurchases as well as increased dividend payments partially offset by lower repayments of long term debt in 2011 

capital resources 

based on historical performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance the cash generated from our operations our committed credit lines and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures share repurchase programs upcoming debt maturities and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the foreseeable future 

capital expenditures were  2626 million   2429 million  and  1795 million  for 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively our investments continue to improve manufacturing productivity reduce costs and provide environmental enhancements and advanced technologies for existing facilities the capital expenditure program for 2013  is estimated to be approximately 250 million including amounts approved in prior periods many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at our option without incurring substantial charges 

for financial market risk impacting the company see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

capitalization 

in addition to cash on hand and operating cash flow we maintain significant credit availability under our commercial paper program our ability to borrow at a costeffective rate under the commercial paper program is contingent upon maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating as of december 31 2012  our credit ratings were as follows 

  



the credit ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

our public debt does not contain financial covenants and our revolving credit lines have a debttototal capital covenant of 65 as of december 31 2012  our debttototal capital ratio was significantly beneath this limit 

guarantees 

subsequent to the ireland reorganization irireland and irlimited guarantee fully and unconditionally the outstanding public debt of irinternational irglobal and irnew jersey see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment periods in millions 

  



 includes 343 million of debt redeemable at the option of the holder the scheduled maturities of these bonds range between 2027 and 2028 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above 

pensions 

at december 31 2012  we had net obligations of  9184 million  which consist of noncurrent pension assets of  51 million  and current and noncurrent pension benefit liabilities of  9235 million  it is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required we currently project that we will contribute approximately  1025 million  to our plans worldwide in 2013  because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for pension obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

postretirement benefits other than pensions 

at december 31 2012  we had postretirement benefit obligations of  8514 million  we fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a payasyougo basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations benefit payments which are net of expected plan participant contributions and medicare part d subsidy are expected to be approximately  693 million  in 2013  because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for postretirement obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income taxes 

at december 31 2012  we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of  5337 million  and  841 million  of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax the liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits and internal revenue service irs tax disputes 

contingent liabilities 

we are involved in various litigations claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

see note 9 and note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on matters affecting our liquidity 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and 

assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

 recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test included in us gaap for those reporting units where it is required the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a second step is performed wherein the reporting units carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value impairment exists and must be recognized 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is based on two valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model income approach and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues market approach with each method being equally weighted in the calculation we believe an equal weighting of both approaches is appropriate the income approach relies on the companys estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing growth and margins with due consideration given to forecasting risk the market approach reflects the markets expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publicly traded companies and the subject reporting units 

in step 2 the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit 

recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is first assessed using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired this assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset for those indefinitelived assets where it is required a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology income approach which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess 

the determination of the estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows including profit margins longterm forecasts discount rates and terminal growth rates we developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit 

2012 impairment test 

for our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2012 we concluded it was necessary to calculate the fair value for each of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangibles based on the results of these calculations we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

goodwill   under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 100  to 155  near term growth rates ranging from 35  to 148  and terminal growth rates ranging from 25  to 40  under the market approach we used an adjusted multiple ranging from 66  to 92  of projected earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and 08  to 18  of projected revenues based on the market information of comparable companies additionally we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization 

for all reporting units except two the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 15  the two reporting units with a percentage of carrying value less than 15 reported within the residential solutions and security technologies segments exceeded their carrying value by 144  and 25  respectively these reporting units have goodwill of approximately  599 million  and  190 million  respectively 

for the specific security technologies reporting unit that exceeded its carrying value by less than 5 we have provided below additional assumptions and a sensitivity analysis under the income approach we assumed a discount rate of 10 near term growth rates ranging from 11 to 5 and a terminal growth rate of 25 under the market approach we assumed a weighted average multiple of 78 and 71 times projected 2012 and 2013 ebitda respectively and a multiple of 08 times projected 2012 and 2013 revenue based on industry market data holding other assumptions constant a 10 increase in the discount rate would result in a 20 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit a 10 decrease in the longterm growth rate would result in a 15 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and a 50 decrease in the selected market multiples would result in a 15 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit each of these scenarios individually would result in the reporting unit failing step 1 

assessing the fair value of goodwill includes among other things making key assumptions for estimating future cash flows and appropriate market multiples these assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity we make every effort to estimate future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed however changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and could result in impairment charges in future periods factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit include but are not limited to the following 

• decreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greaterthanexpected declines in volumes pricing pressures or disruptive technology 

• declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition or an inability to develop or launch new products 

• the impacts of the european sovereign debt crisis including greaterthanexpected declines in pricing reductions in volumes or fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

• the level of success of ongoing and future research and development efforts including those related to recent acquisitions and increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products 

• increase in the price or decrease in the availability of key commodities and the impact of higher energy prices 

• increases in our marketparticipant riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital and 

• changes in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses 

other indefinitelived intangible assets   in testing our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 120 to 125 terminal growth rates ranging from 25 to 30 and royalty rates ranging from 30 to 50 the fair values of our trane and american standard tradenames exceeded their respective carrying amounts by less than 15 the two tradenames exceeded their carrying value by 105 and 130 respectively the carrying values of these tradenames are approximately 2497 million and 105 million respectively at december 31 2012 

a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on their estimated fair values of any of our tradenames 

2011 impairment test 

as a result of the planned divestiture of hussmann we were required to test goodwill remaining within the climate solutions segment for impairment in the first quarter of 2011 no impairment charge was required for the remaining climate solutions 

segment based on year to date operational results and management turnover within the residential hvac reporting unit we updated our fair value assessment of the reporting unit in the third quarter of 2011 and noted that the fair value of the reporting unit continued to exceed its carrying amount 

for our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2011 we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

goodwill   under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 120 to 170 and terminal growth rates ranging from 25 to 40 under the market approach we used an adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues based on the market information of comparable companies additionally we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization 

for all reporting units except two the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 15 the two reporting units with a percentage of carrying value less than 15 reported within the residential solutions and security technologies segments exceeded their carrying value by 58 and 109 respectively these reporting units have goodwill of approximately 599 million and 198 million respectively a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units 

other indefinitelived intangible assets   in testing our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 125 to 145 terminal growth rates ranging from 25 to 30 and royalty rates ranging from 30 to 50 the fair values of two of our tradenames exceeded their respective carrying amounts by less than 15 the two tradenames reported within the climate solutions and residential solutions segments exceeded their carrying value by 73 and 116 the carrying values of these tradenames are approximately 2497 million and 105 million a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on their estimated fair values

incurred we enter into agreements that contain multiple elements such as equipment installation and service revenue for multipleelement arrangements the revenue relating to undelivered elements is deferred until delivery of the deferred elements we recognize revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has standalone value to the customer customer acceptance has occurred and there are only customary refund or return rights related to the delivered elements revenues from certain of our equipment and the related installation sold under constructiontype contracts are recorded using the percentageofcompletion method in accordance with gaap 

 the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 

 changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the expected 2013 net periodic pension cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 86 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately 79 million a 025 rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would increase expected 2013 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by 07 million and a 10 increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the cost by approximately 14 million

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu 201108 testing goodwill for impairment this revised standard provides entities with the option to first use an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if a conclusion is reached that reporting unit fair value is not more likely than not below carrying value no further impairment testing is necessary this revised guidance applies to fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 and the related interim and annual goodwill impairment tests the requirements of asu 201108 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in july 2012 the fasb issued asu 201202 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment this revised standard provides entities with the option to first use an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if a conclusion is reached that the indefinitelived intangible asset fair value is not more likely than not below carrying value no further impairment testing is necessary we elected to early adopt the requirements of asu 201202 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world we actively manage material currency exposures that are associated with purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities at the operating unit level those exposures that cannot be naturally offset to an insignificant amount are hedged with foreign currency derivatives derivative instruments utilized by us in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2012  a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an unrealized loss of approximately  1189 million  as compared with  1109 million  at december 31 2011  these amounts when realized would be offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2012  

interest rate exposure 

our debt portfolio mainly consists of fixedrate instruments and therefore any fluctuation in market interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations

 item 9a   controls and procedures 



the companys management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the companys disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded as of december 31 2012 that the companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the exchange act has been recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commissions rules and forms and that such information has been accumulated and communicated to the companys management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 



the companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined under exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by the companys board of directors to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

management has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 in making its assessment management has utilized the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway commission in internal control  integrated framework management concluded that based on its assessment the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2012 

the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears herein 



there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting as defined by rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2012 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the companys internal control over financial reporting 



in the companys quarterly report on form 10q for the period ended june 30 2012 management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to internal controls over the accounting for deferred tax balances and related valuation allowances specifically the companys interim controls related to timely identification of and accounting for the impact of enacted tax law changes did not operate as designed this resulted in a misstatement of a deferred tax asset related valuation allowance in the march 31 2012 balance sheet and the provision for income taxes for the period ended march 31 2012 an outofperiod adjustment was recorded in the three month period ended june 30 2012 as described in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

to remediate the material weakness described above management implemented additional processes and controls during the quarter ended september 30 2012 including expanded procedures to identify and assess tax law changes along with notifications and certifications as part of the interim and annual close process and through the respective sec filing date to verify managements conclusions regarding the timing of enacted tax law changes 

management has determined that the remediation actions discussed above were effectively designed and demonstrated effective operation for a sufficient period of time to enable the company to conclude that the material weakness regarding its internal controls associated with the accounting for deferred tax balances and related valuation allowances has been remediated as of december 31 2012

products 

our principal products by business segment include the following 

  









these products are sold primarily under our name and under other names including american standard aro cisa club car lcn schlage thermo king von duprin and trane 

competitive conditions 

our products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world due to the diversity of these products and the variety of markets served we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line they include wellestablished regional or specialized competitors as well as larger us and nonus corporations or divisions of larger companies 

the principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price quality delivery service and support technology and innovation we believe that we are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of hvac systems and services air compression systems transport temperature control products air tools and golf and utility vehicles in addition we believe we are a leading supplier in us markets for architectural hardware products mechanical locks and electronic and biometric accesscontrol technologies 

distribution 

our products are distributed by a number of methods which we believe are appropriate to the type of product us sales are made through branch sales offices and through distributors dealers and large retailers across the country nonus sales are made through numerous subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world 

customers 

we have no customer that accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues in 2011  2010  or 2009  no material part of our business is dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers therefore the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

raw materials 

we manufacture many of the components included in our products which requires us to employ a wide variety of commodities principal commodities such as steel copper and aluminum are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world in the past higher prices for some commodities particularly steel and nonferrous metals have caused pricing pressures in some of our businesses we have historically been able to pass certain of these cost increases on to customers in the form of price increases 

we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future there have been no commodity shortages which have had a material adverse effect on our businesses however significant changes in certain material costs may have an adverse impact on our costs and operating margins to mitigate this potential impact we enter into longterm supply contracts in order to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions 

working capital 

we manufacture products that usually must be readily available to meet our customers’ rapid delivery requirements therefore we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs and our customers’ requirements such working capital requirements are not however in the opinion of management materially different from those experienced by our major competitors we believe our sales and payment terms are competitive in and appropriate for the markets in which we compete 

seasonality 

demand for certain segments of our products and services is influenced by weather conditions for instance tranes sales have historically tended to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because in the us and other northern hemisphere markets summer is the peak season for sales of air conditioning systems and services therefore results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unexpected cool trends or unseasonably warm trends during the summer season could negatively or positively affect certain segments of our business and impact overall results of operations 

research and development 

we engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products enhance existing product effectiveness increase safety improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate in addition we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment or acquisition we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development activities as we look to maintain and improve our competitive position research and development expenditures including qualifying engineering costs were approximately  2573 million  in 2011   2440 million  in 2010  and  2550 million  in 2009  

patents and licenses 

we own numerous patents and patent applications and are licensed under others although in aggregate we consider our patents and licenses to be valuable to our operations we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single patent or license or any group of them in our opinion engineering production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our patents andor licenses 

operations by geographic area 

more than 40  of our 2011  net revenues were derived outside the us and we sold products in more than 100 countries therefore the attendant risks of manufacturing or selling in a particular country such as nationalization and establishment of common markets may have an adverse impact on our nonus operations for a discussion of risks attendant to our nonus operations see “risk factors – our global operations subject us to economic risks” and “risk factors – currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results” in item 1a and “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in item 7a 

backlog 

our approximate backlog of orders believed to be firm at december 31  was as follows 

  

these backlog figures are based on orders received while the major portion of our products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock orders for specialized machinery or specific customer application are submitted with extensive lead times and are often subject to revision deferral cancellation or termination we expect to ship substantially all the december 31 2011  backlog during 2012  

environmental matters 

we continue to be dedicated to an environmental program intended to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process as well as to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the environmental protection agency and similar state authorities we have been also identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future 

we incurred  31 million   10 million  and 25 million  of expenses during the years ended december 31 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us as of december 31 2011  and 2010  we have recorded reserves for environmental matters of  717 million  and  810 million  respectively of these amounts  513 million  and  563 million  relate to remediation of sites previously disposed by us environmental reserves are classified as accrued expenses and other current liabilities or other noncurrent liabilities based on their expected term our total current environmental reserve at december 31 2011  and 2010  was  269 million  and  281 million  respectively given the evolving nature of environmental laws regulations and technology the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain 

for a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities see also part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental and asbestos matters as well as note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

asbestos matters 

certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries are named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in us state and federal courts in virtually all of the suits a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants the vast majority of those claims have been filed against either ingersollrand company irnew jersey or trane and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by irnew jersey or trane primarily pumps boilers and railroad brake shoes neither irnew jersey nor trane was a producer or manufacturer of asbestos however some formerly manufactured products utilized asbestoscontaining components such as gaskets and packings purchased from thirdparty suppliers 

see also the discussion under part i item 3 legal proceedings and part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental and asbestos matters as well as note 19 to the consolidated financial statements

 item 1a  risk factors 

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to a number of risks that could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k the risks set forth below are those we consider most significant we face other risks however that we do not currently perceive to be material but could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from our expectations you should evaluate all risks before you invest in our securities if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted in that case the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including europe china brazil venezuela africa india and turkey these activities are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

 8 

 these risks could increase our cost of doing business internationally disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers to fulfill their obligations limit our ability to sell products in certain markets and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

we must develop and commercialize new products and services in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business the development and commercialization of new products and services require a significant investment of resources we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by the market failure to develop new products and services that are accepted by the market could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

more than 40  of our 2011  net revenues were derived outside the us and we expect sales to nonus customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues although we enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to currency exchange fluctuations changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time may in some instances have a material impact on our results of operations because we do not hedge against all of our currency exposure our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations 

we also translate assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in nonus dollar currencies into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements based on the applicable exchange rates consequently fluctuations in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will have a material impact on the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation asbestosrelated matters that cannot be predicted with certainty as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other contingencies may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any improper conduct could damage our reputation and subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects financial condition results of operations cash flows and the market value of our stock 

we may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate our business we are also investing in new information technology systems that are designed to continue improving our operations if these systems cease to function properly or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

commodity shortages and price increases and higher energy prices could adversely affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities particularly steel and nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows we do not currently hedge against this volatility while we use fixed price contracts to mitigate this exposure we expect any future hedging activity to seek to minimize nearterm volatility of the commodity prices which would not protect us from longterm commodity price increases 

additionally we are exposed to large fluctuations in the price of petroleumbased fuel due to the instability of current market prices higher energy costs increase our operating costs and the cost of shipping our products and supplying services to customers around the world consequently sharp price increases the imposition of taxes or an interruption of supply could cause us to lose the ability to effectively manage the risk of rising fuel prices and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

our operational excellence efforts may not achieve the improvements we expect 

we utilize a number of tools such as lean six sigma to improve operational efficiency and productivity implementation of new processes to our operations could cause disruptions and there is no assurance that all of our planned operational excellence projects will be fully implemented or if implemented will realize the expected improvements 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

at december 31 2011 the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled  61 billion  and  26 billion  respectively in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairments to goodwill or other indefinitelived assets any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the periods recognized 

changes in weather patterns and seasonal fluctuations may adversely affect certain segments of the companys business and impact overall results of operations 

demand for certain segments of the companys products and services is influenced by weather conditions for instance tranes sales have historically tended to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because in the us and other northern hemisphere markets summer is the peak season for sales of air conditioning systems and services therefore results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unexpected cool trends or unseasonably warm trends during the summer season could negatively or positively affect certain segments of the companys business and impact overall results of operations 

continued weakness in the residential and commercial construction markets may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

certain of the companys segments provide products and services to the residential and commercial construction markets weakness in these markets may negatively impact the demand for our products and services decrease in the demand for our products and services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including environmental and health and safety we have made and will be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations changes in current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require 

significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services in addition our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties fines or other sanctions if we are unable to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 

if the distribution of wabcos shares by trane on july 31 2007 were to fail to qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under section 355 of the internal revenue code the “code” then trane may be required to pay us federal income taxes 

trane received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of wabco shares to its shareholders qualified as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under section 355 of the code trane also received an opinion of skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp at the time of the distribution as to the taxfree nature of the transaction moreover in connection with our subsequent acquisition of trane we received an opinion of simpson thacher  bartlett llp substantially to the effect that the distribution should continue to qualify as taxfree to trane wabco and trane shareholders under section 355 and related provisions of the code the ruling and opinions were based on among other things certain assumptions as well as on the accuracy of certain factual representations and statements made by the company wabco and trane in rendering its ruling the irs also relied on certain covenants that trane and wabco entered into including the adherence to certain restrictions on wabcos and tranes future actions 

notwithstanding the private letter ruling or the opinions of counsel there can be no assurance that the irs will not later assert that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction if the wabco distribution is determined to be taxable we would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of i the fair market value of wabcos common stock distributed to the trane shareholders over ii tranes tax basis in such common stock we have a tax sharing agreement with wabco under which wabco would be responsible for all taxes imposed on trane as a result of the distribution except where taxes are imposed as a result of actions taken after the distribution by trane or any of its subsidiaries or shareholders if wabco was unable to satisfy its obligations under the tax sharing agreement or if trane was unable to rely on the tax sharing agreement for any reason any potential liability arising from the distribution of wabcos shares by trane could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to our past reorganizations   

we effected a corporate reorganization in december 2001 to become a bermuda company the bermuda reorganization and a subsequent corporate reorganization in july 2009 to become an irish public limited company these reorganizations exposed us and our shareholders to the risks described below in addition we cannot be assured that all of the anticipated benefits of the reorganizations will be realized 

changes in tax laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under us or nonus tax laws or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our reorganizations could be impacted by changes in tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the us tax authorities or nonus tax authorities from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for instance recent us legislative proposals would broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident for us tax purposes which would significantly diminish the realization of any tax benefit related to our reorganizations there are other recent us legislative proposals that could modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position moreover other us legislative proposals could have a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments by our us subsidiaries to our nonus affiliates which could increase our tax liability we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation in any jurisdiction 

while we monitor proposals that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax law is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding the ireland reorganization limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

while our us operations are subject to us tax we believe that a significant portion of our nonus operations are generally not subject to us tax other than withholding taxes the irs or a court however may not concur with our conclusions including 

our determination that we and a significant number of our foreign subsidiaries are not currently controlled foreign corporations cfc within the meaning of the us tax laws a contrary determination which could also arise through significant future acquisitions of our stock by us persons could also potentially cause us holders direct indirect or constructive owners of 10 or more of our stock or the voting stock of our nonus subsidiaries to include in their gross income their pro rata share of certain of our and our nonus subsidiary income for the period during which we and our nonus subsidiaries were a cfc in addition gain or a portion of such gain realized on cfc shares sold by such shareholders may be treated as ordinary income depending on certain facts treatment of us or any of our nonus subsidiaries as a cfc could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

as described further in “legal proceedings” we have received several notices from the irs containing proposed adjustments to our tax filings in connection with an audit of the 20012002 tax years the irs has not contested the validity of our reincorporation in bermuda in any of these notices we have and intend to continue to vigorously contest these proposed adjustments 

although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty based upon an analysis of the merits of our position we believe that we are adequately reserved for this matter and do not expect that the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition or cash flows as we move forward to resolve this matter with the irs the reserves established may be adjusted although we continue to contest the irss position there can be no assurance that we will be successful if the irss position with respect to 2002 is ultimately sustained it will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

although we expect them to do so at this time the irs has not yet proposed any similar adjustments for years subsequent to 2002 as the federal income tax audits for those years are still in process or have not yet begun it is unclear how the irs will apply their position to subsequent years or whether the irs will take a similar position with respect to other intercompany debt instruments 

the inability to realize any anticipated tax benefits related to our reorganizations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

legislative and regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us 

the us federal government and various states and municipalities have enacted or may enact legislation intended to deny government contracts to us companies that reincorporate outside of the us or have reincorporated outside of the us 

for instance the homeland security act of 2002 as amended includes a provision that prohibits “inverted domestic corporations” and their subsidiaries from entering into contracts with the department of homeland security in addition the state of california adopted legislation intended to limit the eligibility of certain nonus chartered companies to participate in certain state contracts more recently the 2008 2009 and 2010 consolidated appropriations acts prohibit any federal government agency from using funds appropriated by congress for fiscal years 2008 2009 and 2010 to pay an inverted domestic corporation or any of its subsidiaries for work performed or products provided under certain federal contracts “affected contracts” although the amount of monies already paid to us or to be paid to us under the affected contracts is not material to the company we cannot provide any assurance that the impact of future actions taken by the government in this area will not be materially adverse to our operations 

in addition there continues to be negative publicity regarding and criticism of companies that conduct business in the united states and in other countries but have changed their place of incorporation to another country 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities   

the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemptive rights with respect to any particular allotment of shares these authorizations must be renewed by the shareholders every five years and we cannot guarantee that these authorizations will always be approved 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax   

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders resident in the united states will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could have an adverse impact on the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax   

dividends paid in respect of our shares will generally not be subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in irireland 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in irireland

on july 20 2007 we received a notice from the internal revenue service irs containing proposed adjustments to our tax filings in connection with an audit of the 2001 and 2002 tax years the irs did not contest the validity of our reincorporation in bermuda the most significant adjustments proposed by the irs involve treating the entire intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in bermuda as equity as a result of this recharacterization the irs disallowed the deduction of interest paid on the debt and imposed dividend withholding taxes on the payments denominated as interest the irs also asserted an alternative argument to be applied if the intercompany debt is respected as debt in that circumstance the irs proposed to ignore the entities that hold the debt and to which the interest was paid and impose 30  withholding tax on a portion of the interest payments as if they were made directly to a company that was not eligible for reduced us withholding tax under a us income tax treaty the irs asserted under this alternative theory that we owe additional taxes with respect to 2002 of approximately  84 million  plus interest we strongly disagreed with the view of the irs and filed a protest with the irs in the third quarter of 2007 

on january 12 2010 we received an amended notice from the irs eliminating its assertion that the intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in bermuda should be treated as equity however the irs continues to assert the alternative position described above and proposes adjustments to our 2002 tax filings if this alternative position is upheld the company would be required to record additional charges in addition the irs provided notice on january 19 2010 that it is assessing penalties of 30  on the asserted underpayment of tax described above 

we have and intend to continue to vigorously contest these proposed adjustments we in consultation with our outside advisors carefully considered the form and substance of our intercompany financing arrangements including the actions necessary to qualify for the benefits of the applicable us income tax treaties we believe that these financing arrangements are in accordance with the laws of the relevant jurisdictions including the us that the entities involved should be respected and that the interest payments qualify for the us income tax treaty benefits claimed 

although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty based upon an analysis of the merits of our position we believe that we are adequately reserved for this matter and do not expect that the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition or cash flows as we move forward to resolve this matter with the irs the reserves established may be adjusted although we continue to contest the irss position there can be no assurance that we will be successful if the irss position with respect to 2002 is ultimately sustained it will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

although we expect them to do so at this time the irs has not yet proposed any similar adjustments for years subsequent to 2002 as the federal income tax audits for those years are still in process or have not yet begun it is unclear how the irs will apply their position to subsequent years or whether the irs will take a similar position with respect to other intercompany debt instruments

trends and economic events 

we are a global corporation with worldwide operations as a global business our operations are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic factors as well as political factors wherever we operate or do business our geographic and industry diversity as well as the diversity of our product sales and services has helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results 

given the broad range of products manufactured and geographic markets served management uses a variety of factors to predict the outlook for the company we monitor key competitors and customers in order to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future in addition our order rates are indicative of future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance in those industry segments where we are a capital equipment provider revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy 

since the onset of the economic downturn in 2008 we have seen weaker demand for many of our products and services across each of our businesses current market conditions continue to impact our financial results for example depressed residential and consumer markets are impacting the operating results in our residential hvac and golf equipment businesses the residential hvac business is also being impacted by a mix shift to units with a lower seasonal energy efficiency rating seer stagnant building activity is negatively impacting the results of our security business however we have seen sustained recoveries in the worldwide industrial and refrigerated transport markets global parts and service activity and across most of our businesses in 

asia we believe the north american commercial hvac market is also slowly recovering as economic conditions continue to stabilize we expect modest revenue growth along with the continued benefits of restructuring savings and productivity programs 

despite the current market environment we believe we have a solid foundation of global brands and leading market shares in all of our major product lines our growing geographic and industry diversity coupled with our large installed product base provides growth opportunities within our service parts and replacement revenue streams in addition we are investing substantial resources to innovate and develop new products and services which we expect will drive our future growth

venezuela devaluation 

during the fourth quarter of 2009 the blended consumer price indexnational consumer price index of venezuela reached a cumulative threeyear inflation rate in excess of 100 as a result venezuela was designated as highly inflationary effective january 1 2010 accordingly the us dollar was determined to be the functional currency of our venezuelan subsidiaries and all foreign currency fluctuations during 2011 and 2010 have been recorded in other net 

at december 31 2009 we remeasured our foreign currency receivables and payables associated with the venezuelan bolivar at the parallel rate of 60  bolivars for each us dollar this was based on our inability to settle certain transactions through the official government channels in an expeditious manner previously we remeasured all foreign currency transactions at the official rate of 215  bolivars to the us dollar as a result we recorded a  24 million  charge in the fourth quarter of 2009 associated with the devaluation 

on may 17 2010 the government of venezuela effectively closed down the parallel market claiming it was a significant cause of inflation in venezuela on june 9 2010 a new parallel market sitme opened under control of the central bank at which time the company began utilizing it for currency exchange subject to any limitations under local regulations effective august 2011 we began utilizing the official rate now 429  bolivars to the us dollar for remeasurement purposes due to our increased ability to settle transactions at that rate

healthcare reform 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the healthcare and education reconciliation bill of 2010 collectively the healthcare reform legislation were signed into law as a result effective 2013 the tax benefits available to us will be reduced to the extent our prescription drug expenses are reimbursed under the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy program although the provisions of the healthcare reform legislation relating to the retiree drug subsidy program do not take effect until 2013 we are required to recognize the full accounting impact in our financial statements in the reporting period in which the healthcare reform legislation is enacted as retiree healthcare liabilities and related tax impacts are already reflected in our financial statements the healthcare reform legislation resulted in a noncash charge to income tax expense in the first quarter of 2010 of  405 million  

currently our retiree medical plans receive the retiree drug subsidy under medicare part d no later than 2014 a significant portion of the drug coverage will be moved to an employer group waiver plan while retaining the same benefit provisions this change resulted in an actuarial gain which decreased our december 31 2010 retiree medical plan liability as well as the net actuarial losses in other comprehensive income by  411 million  

we will continue to monitor the healthcare reform legislation to review provisions which could impact our accounting for retiree medical benefits in future periods we may consider future plan amendments which may have accounting implications as further regulations are promulgated and interpretations of the legislation become available additionally we continue to monitor the individual market place for post65 retiree medical coverage and will consider amendments to our health plans which may have accounting implications on our plans 

the healthcare reform legislation could also impact our accounting for income taxes in future periods we will continue to assess the accounting implications of the healthcare reform legislation

review of business segments

segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for performance reviews compensation and resource allocation for these reasons we believe that segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss management may exclude certain charges or gains from operating income to arrive at a segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base its operating decisions we define segment operating margin as segment operating income as a percentage of net revenues

we earn a significant amount of our operating income in jurisdictions where it is deemed to be permanently reinvested our most prominent jurisdiction of operation is the us we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate funds to the us and no provision for us income taxes has been made with respect to such earnings we expect existing cash and cash equivalents available to the us the cash generated by our us operations our committed credit lines as well as our expected ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to fund our us operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future in addition we expect existing nonus cash and cash equivalents and the cash generated by our nonus operations to be sufficient to fund our nonus operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our us operations and we determined that repatriation of nonus cash is necessary such amounts would be subject to us federal income taxes

liquidity 

the following table contains several key measures to gauge our financial condition and liquidity at the periods ended december 31 



shortterm borrowings and current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 consisted of the following 

  



commercial paper program 

the maximum aggregate amount of unsecured commercial paper notes available to be issued on a private placement basis under the commercial paper program is  2 billion  as of december 31 2011  under the commercial paper program ingersollrand global holding company limited irglobal may issue notes from time to time and the proceeds of the financing will be used for general corporate purposes each of irireland irlimited and ingersollrand international holding limited irinternational has provided an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee for the notes issued under the commercial paper program as of december 31 2011  and 2010  we had no amounts outstanding 

debentures with put feature 

at december 31 2011  and 2010  we had outstanding  3436 million  of fixed rate debentures which only require early repayment at the option of the holder these debentures contain a put feature that the holders may exercise on each anniversary of the issuance date if exercised we are obligated to repay in whole or in part at the holder’s option the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of the debentures held by the holder if these options are not exercised the final maturity dates would range between 2027  and 2028  in 2011 holders of these debentures chose not to exercise the put feature on outstanding debentures 

based on our cash flow forecast we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to repay any amounts redeemable as a result of these put features 

exchangeable senior notes due 2012 

in april 2009 we issued  345 million  of 45  exchangeable senior notes the notes through our whollyowned subsidiary irglobal the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of irireland irlimited and irinternational interest on the notes is paid twice a year in arrears in addition holders have the option to exchange their notes through their scheduled maturity in april 2012 

upon any exchange the notes will be paid in cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be exchanged the remainder due on the option feature if any may be paid in cash irireland ordinary shares or a combination thereof at the option of the company on november 14 2011 we elected for all future exercises to settle the remainder due on the option feature in whole shares of irireland with cash in lieu of any fractional shares the notes are subject to certain customary covenants however none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations 

we account for the notes in accordance with gaap which required us to allocate the proceeds between debt and equity at the issuance date in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate we allocated approximately  305 million  of the gross proceeds to debt with the remaining discount of approximately  40 million  approximately  39 million  after allocated fees recorded within equity as of december 31 2011 the notes may be exchangeable at the holders’ option through their scheduled 

maturity in april 2012 therefore the equity portion of the notes is classified as temporary equity to reflect the amount that could result in cash settlement at the balance sheet date additionally we are amortizing the discount into interest expense over a threeyear period 

senior notes due 2014 

in april 2009 we issued  655 million  of 95  senior notes through our whollyowned subsidiary irglobal the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of irireland irlimited and irinternational interest on the fixed rate notes will be paid twice a year in arrears we have the option to redeem them in whole or in part at any time and from time to time prior to their stated maturity date at redemption prices set forth in the indenture agreement the notes are subject to certain customary covenants however none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations 

accounts receivable purchase program 

on march 31 2009 we expanded our existing trane accounts receivable purchase program to encompass originators from all four of our business segments for the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded a cash outflow of approximately  63 million  within cash flow from operations which represented the decrease in the net interests of the receivables sold to the conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions on february 17 2010 we terminated the expanded facility prior to its expiration in march 2010 

other 

in may 2010 we entered into a 3year  10 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility on may 20 2011 we entered into a 4year  10 billion  revolving credit facility through our whollyowned subsidiary irglobal this new facility replaced our preexisting  10 billion  3year revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature in june 2011  at december 31 2011  our total committed revolving credit facilities was  20 billion  of which  10 billion  expires in may 2013  and  10 billion  expires in may 2015  each of irireland irlimited and irinternational has provided an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee for these credit facilities these lines are unused and provide support for our commercial paper program as well as for other general corporate purposes 

pension plans 

our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due we seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities prior to 2011 we utilized assetliability modeling studies as the basis for global asset allocation decisions in 2011 we adopted a dynamic approach to asset allocation whereby a plans allocation to fixed income assets increases progressively over time towards an ultimate target of 90 as a plan moves toward full funding we monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance 

we monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis during 2011 none of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to the volatility in the markets for further details on pension plan activity see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

cash flows

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was  12302 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared with  7564 million  in 2010  operating cash flows for 2011 reflect improved earnings from continuing operations after consideration of the noncash loss on saleasset impairment charge related to the hussmann divestiture operating cash flows for 2010 reflect discretionary cash contributions to our pension funds of 444 million 359 million after tax benefit received 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was  7564 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with  17569 million  in 2009  as a result of the severe economic downturn positive operating cash flows for 2009 reflected decreased volume levels and our increased focus on working capital management including improvements in accounts 

receivable collections and inventory management while we continued to actively manage working capital in 2010 our operating cash flows reflected increased accounts receivable and inventory levels from 2009 as several of our end markets stabilized and we anticipated improvement in several of our key end markets during 2011 additionally during 2010 we made discretionary cash contributions to our pension funds of 444 million 359 million after tax benefit received

net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was  1631 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared with net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations of  1790 million  in 2010  the change in investing activities is primarily attributable to net proceeds from the sale of the discontinued operations 356 million as well as proceeds from the sale of assets from a restructured business in china these proceeds were partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures during 2011 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was  1790 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared with  1831 million  in 2009  the change in investing activities is primarily attributable to a reduction in capital expenditures during 2010 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended december 31 2011  was  12464 million  compared with  4037 million  during 2010  the change in financing activities is primarily related to approximately  12 billion  of share repurchases as well as increased dividend payments partially offset by lower repayments of long term debt in 2011 

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended december 31 2010  was  4037 million  compared with  12081 million  during 2009  the change in financing activities is primarily related to less debt repayments in 2010 additional stock options exercised and a reduction of the quarterly stock dividend 

capital resources 

based on historical performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance the cash generated from our operations our committed credit lines and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the foreseeable future 

capital expenditures were  2429 million   1795 million  and  2041 million  for 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively our investments continue to improve manufacturing productivity reduce costs and provide environmental enhancements and advanced technologies for existing facilities the capital expenditure program for 2012  is estimated to be approximately 250 million including amounts approved in prior periods many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at our option without incurring substantial charges

future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes environmental and asbestosrelated matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above 

pensions 

at december 31 2011  we had net obligations of  7407 million  which consist of noncurrent pension assets of  47 million  and current and noncurrent pension benefit liabilities of  7454 million  it is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required we currently project that we will contribute approximately  983 million  to our plans worldwide in 2012  because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for pension obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

postretirement benefits other than pensions 

at december 31 2011  we had postretirement benefit obligations of  9199 million  we fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a payasyougo basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations benefit payments which are net of expected plan participant contributions and medicare part d subsidy are expected to be approximately  732 million  in 2012  because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for postretirement obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income taxes 

at december 31 2011  we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of  5369 million  and  1083 million  of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax the liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits and internal revenue service irs tax disputes 

environmental and asbestos matters 

we are involved in various litigations claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

see note 8 and note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on matters affecting our liquidity 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

 recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and determined using a two step process the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a second step is performed wherein the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value impairment exists and must be recognized 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is based on two valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model income approach and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues market approach with each method being equally weighted in the calculation in step 2 the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit 

recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible assets to the estimated fair value of the respective intangible assets any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess the calculation of estimated fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology income approach which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset 

the determination of the estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows including profit margins longterm forecasts discount rates and terminal growth rates we developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit 

2011 impairment test 

as a result of the planned divestiture of hussmann we were required to test goodwill within the climate solutions segment for impairment in the first quarter of 2011 and no impairment charge was required based on year to date operational results and management turnover within the residential hvac reporting unit we updated our fair value assessment of the reporting unit in the third quarter of 2011 and noted that the fair value of the reporting unit continued to exceed its carrying amount 

for our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2011 we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

goodwill   under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 120  to 170  and terminal growth rates ranging from 25  to 40  under the market approach we used an adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues based on the market information of comparable companies additionally we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization 

for all reporting units except two the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 15  the two reporting units with a percentage of carrying value less than 15 reported within the residential solutions and security technologies segments exceeded their carrying value by 58  and 109  respectively these reporting units have goodwill of approximately  599 million  and  198 million  respectively a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units 

other indefinitelived intangible assets   in testing our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 125 to 145 terminal growth rates ranging from 25 to 30 and royalty rates ranging from 30 to 50 the fair values of two of our tradenames exceeded their respective carrying amounts by less than 15 the two tradenames reported within the climate solutions and residential solutions segments exceeded their carrying value by 73 and 116 the carrying values of these tradenames are approximately 2497 million and 105 million a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on their estimated fair values 

2010 impairment test 

for our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2010 we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

goodwill   under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates generally ranging from 115  to 18  and terminal growth rates generally ranging from 25  to 4  under the market approach we used an adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues based on the market information of comparable companies additionally we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization 

for all reporting units except three the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 15  the three reporting units with a percentage of carrying value less than 15 reported within the climate solutions segment exceeded their carrying value by 44  94  and 108  these reporting units have goodwill of approximately  243 million   1075 million  and  561 million  respectively a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units 

other indefinitelived intangible assets   in testing our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 120 to 140 terminal growth rates ranging from 25 to 30 and royalty rates ranging from 20 to 50 the fair values of two of our tradenames exceeded their respective carrying amounts by less than 15 the two tradenames reported within the climate solutions residential solutions and security technologies segments exceeded their carrying value by 69 and 56 respectively the carrying values of these tradenames are approximately 2497 million and 9 million a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on their estimated fair values

on the nature of the reserve and in certain instances with consultation of legal counsel internal and external consultants and engineers subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for these types of liabilities we believe our estimated reserves are reasonable and do not believe the final determination of the liabilities with respect to these matters would have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity or cash flows for any year   

 the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved

held and the target asset allocation the expected longterm rate of return is determined as of each measurement date we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors 

changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the expected 2012 net periodic pension cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 105 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately 76 million a 025 rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would increase expected 2012 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by 09 million and a 10 increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the cost by approximately 18 million 

the preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts included in our consolidated financial statements if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which the actual amounts become known historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 200913 revenue recognition topic 605 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force which revised guidance within fasb accounting standards codification asc 605 revenue recognition these revisions include additional disclosures regarding multipledeliverable revenue arrangements such as any significant assumptions made and the effects of the relative selling price method on revenue recognition the new disclosure requirements were effective for the company as of january 1 2011 the provisions of asu 200913 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and notes 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu 201109 “compensation  retirement benefits  multiemployer plans subtopic 71580” the revised guidance expands the required disclosures of employers on multiemployer pension plan participation obligations and funded status the revised disclosure requirements are reflected in note 10 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in may 2011 the fasb issued asu 201104 “fair value measurement topic 820 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs asu 201104 represents converged guidance between gaap and ifrs resulting in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements this new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 and subsequent interim periods we are currently assessing the impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu 201105 “presentation of comprehensive income asu 201105 requires us to present components of other comprehensive income and of net income in one continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the option to report other comprehensive income within the statement of equity has been removed this new presentation of comprehensive income will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 and subsequent interim periods 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu 201108 “testing goodwill for impairment” this revised standard provides entities with the option to first use an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if a conclusion is reached that reporting unit fair value is not more likely than not below carrying value no further impairment testing is necessary this revised guidance applies to fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 and the related interim and annual goodwill impairment tests we do not believe it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition to manage certain of those exposures we use derivative instruments primarily forward contracts derivative instruments utilized by us in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world we actively manage the currency exposures that are associated with purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities at the operating unit level exposures that cannot be naturally offset to an insignificant amount are hedged with foreign currency derivatives we also have nonus currency net asset exposures which we currently do not hedge with a derivative instrument 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2011  a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an unrealized loss of approximately  1109 million  as compared with  535 million  at december 31 2010  these amounts when realized would be offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying currency transactions 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2011  

interest rate exposure 

our debt portfolio mainly consists of fixedrate instruments and therefore any fluctuation in market interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations

products 

our principal products by business segment include the following 

 

   

 

  

  

 these products are sold primarily under our name and under other names including american standard ®  cisa ®  club car ®  hussmann ®  lcn ®  schlage ®  thermo king ®  von duprin ® and trane ®  

competitive conditions 

our products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world due to the diversity of these products and the variety of markets served we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line they include wellestablished regional or specialized competitors as well as larger us and nonus corporations or divisions of larger companies 

the principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price quality delivery service and support technology and innovation we believe that we are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of hvac systems and services air compression systems transport temperature control products refrigerated display merchandisers refrigeration systems and controls air tools and golf and utility vehicles in addition we believe we are a leading supplier in us markets for architectural hardware products mechanical locks and electronic and biometric accesscontrol technologies 

distribution 

our products are distributed by a number of methods which we believe are appropriate to the type of product us sales are made through branch sales offices and through distributors dealers and large retailers across the country nonus sales are made through numerous subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world 

  

customers 

we have no major customers that accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues in 2010 2009 or 2008 no material part of our business is dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers therefore the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our operations 

raw materials 

we manufacture many of the components included in our products which requires us to employ a wide variety of raw materials principal raw materials such as steel copper and aluminum are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world in the past higher prices for some raw materials particularly steel and nonferrous metals have caused pricing pressures in some of our businesses we have historically been able to pass certain of these cost increases on to customers in the form of price increases 

we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future there have been no raw material shortages which have had a material adverse effect on our businesses however significant changes in certain material costs may have an adverse impact on our costs and operating margins to mitigate this potential impact we enter into longterm supply contracts in order to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions 

working capital 

we manufacture products that usually must be readily available to meet our customers’ rapid delivery requirements therefore we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs and our customers’ requirements such working capital requirements are not however in the opinion of management materially different from those experienced by our major competitors our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors 

research and development 

we engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products enhance existing product effectiveness increase safety improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate in addition we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment or acquisition we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development activities as we look to maintain and improve our competitive position research and development expenditures including qualifying engineering costs were approximately 2440 million in 2010 2550 million in 2009 and 2011 million in 2008 

patents and licenses 

we own numerous patents and patent applications and are licensed under others although in aggregate we consider our patents and licenses to be valuable to our operations we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single patent or license or any group of them in our opinion engineering production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our patents andor licenses 

operations by geographic area 

more than 35 of our 2010 net revenues were derived outside the us and we sold products in more than 100 countries therefore the attendant risks of manufacturing or selling in a particular country such as nationalization and establishment of common markets would not be expected to have a significant effect on our nonus operations for a discussion of risks attendant to our nonus operations see “risk factors – currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations may adversely affect our results” and “risk factors – our global operations subject us to economic risks” in item 1a and “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in item 7a 

  

backlog 

our approximate backlog of orders believed to be firm at december 31 2010 and 2009 were as follows 

 

 these backlog figures are based on orders received while the major portion of our products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock orders for specialized machinery or specific customer application are submitted with extensive lead times and are often subject to revision deferral cancellation or termination we expect to ship substantially the entire backlog at december 31 2010 during 2011 

environmental matters 

we continue to be dedicated to an environmental program intended to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process as well as to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the environmental protection agency and similar state authorities we have been also identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based generally on the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future 

during 2010 we spent 116 million for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we have recorded reserves for environmental matters of 810 million and 914 million respectively given the evolving nature of environmental laws regulations and technology the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain 

for a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities see also part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental and asbestos matters and also note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

asbestos matters 

certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries are named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in state and federal courts in virtually all of the suits a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants the vast majority of those claims has been filed against either irnew jersey or trane and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by irnew jersey or trane primarily pumps boilers and railroad brake shoes neither irnew jersey nor trane was a producer or manufacturer of asbestos however some formerly manufactured products utilized asbestoscontaining components such as gaskets and packings purchased from thirdparty suppliers

more than 35 of our 2010 net revenues were derived outside the us and we expect sales to nonus customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues although we enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to currency exchange fluctuations changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations because we do not hedge against all of our currency exposure our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations 

furthermore the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar we have assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

we are also a large buyer of steel and nonferrous metals as well as other commodities required for the manufacture of our products volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows although we do not currently we may purchase commodity derivatives in the future which could reduce the nearterm volatility of the commodity prices for supplier contracts where fixed pricing is not available however the company’s hedging activities would not be designed to mitigate longterm commodity price fluctuations and therefore would not protect the company from longterm commodity price increases 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation asbestosrelated matters that cannot be predicted with certainty as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other contingencies may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments which could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

such an outcome could have important consequences for example it could 

 

  

   

  

 significant shortages in the raw materials we use in our businesses and higher energy prices could increase our operating costs 

we rely on suppliers to secure raw materials particularly steel and nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

additionally we are exposed to large fluctuations for the price of petroleumbased fuel due to the instability of current market prices higher energy costs increase our operating costs and the cost of shipping our products to and supplying services to customers around the world consequently sharp price increases the imposition of taxes or an interruption of supply could cause us to lose the ability to effectively manage the risk of rising fuel prices and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

changes in weather patterns and seasonal fluctuations may adversely affect certain segments of the company’s business and impact overall results of operations 

demand for certain segments of the company’s products and services is influenced by weather conditions for instance trane’s sales have historically tended to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because in the us and other northern hemisphere markets summer is the peak season for sales of air conditioning systems and services additionally while there is demand for trane’s products and services throughout the year a significant percentage of total sales are related to us residential and commercial construction activity which is generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year therefore results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unexpected cool trends or unseasonably warm trends during the summer season could negatively or positively affect certain segments of the company’s business and impact overall results of operations 

if the distribution of wabco’s shares by trane on july 31 2007 were to fail to qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under section 355 of the internal revenue code the code then trane and trane’s shareholders who received wabco common stock in the distribution may be required to pay us federal income taxes 

on july 31 2007 trane then known as american standard companies inc completed the spinoff of its vehicle control systems business into a new publicly traded company named wabco at the time trane received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs substantially to the effect that the distribution qualified as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under section 355 of the code in addition trane received an opinion of skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp tax counsel to trane substantially to the effect that the distribution will qualify as taxfree to trane wabco and trane shareholders under section 355 and related provisions of the code the ruling and opinion were based on among other things certain assumptions as well as on the accuracy of certain factual representations and statements made by wabco and trane in rendering its ruling the irs also relied on certain covenants that trane and wabco entered into including the adherence to certain restrictions on wabco’s and trane’s future actions 

  

in connection with our acquisition of trane in june 2008 we received an opinion of simpson thacher  bartlett llp tax counsel to us substantially to the effect that the distribution should continue to qualify as taxfree to trane wabco and trane shareholders under section 355 and related provisions of the code notwithstanding receipt by trane and us of the private letter ruling as well as the opinions of counsel there can be no assurance that the irs will not later assert that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction 

if the distribution fails to qualify for taxfree treatment then trane would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of i the fair market value of wabco’s common stock distributed to the trane shareholders over ii trane’s tax basis in such common stock under the terms of the tax sharing agreement in the event the distribution were to fail to qualify as a taxfree reorganization and such failure was not the result of actions taken after the distribution by trane or any of its subsidiaries or shareholders wabco would be responsible for all taxes imposed on trane as a result thereof in addition each trane shareholder who received wabco common stock in the distribution generally would be treated as having received a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of wabco’s common stock received including any fractional share sold on behalf of the shareholder which would be taxable as a dividend to the extent of the shareholder’s ratable share of trane’s current and accumulated earnings and profits at the time as increased to reflect any current income including any gain recognized by trane on the taxable distribution the balance if any of the distribution would be treated as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the trane shareholder’s tax basis in its trane stock with any remaining amount being taxed as capital gain if wabco was unable to satisfy its obligations under the tax sharing agreement or if trane was unable to rely on the tax sharing agreement for any reason any potential liability arising from the distribution of wabco’s shares by trane could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to our past reorganizations 

we effected a corporate reorganization in december 2001 to become a bermuda company the “bermuda reorganization” and a subsequent corporate reorganization in july 2009 to become an irish public limited company the “ireland reorganization” these reorganizations exposed us and our shareholders to the risks described below in addition we cannot be assured that all of the anticipated benefits of the reorganizations will be realized 

changes in tax laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under us or other tax laws or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our reorganizations could be impacted by changes in tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the us tax authorities or any other tax authority from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions that if enacted could increase our tax burden and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for instance recent u s tax legislative proposals would broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident which would significantly diminish the realization of any tax benefit related to our reorganizations there are other recent us tax legislative proposals that could modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position moreover other us tax legislative proposals could potentially affect us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments by our us subsidiaries to our nonus affiliates which would adversely affect our effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation in any jurisdiction while we are currently monitoring these proposals and others and are investigating all options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals are enacted andor certain tax treaties are amended 

  

while our us operations are subject to us tax we believe that a significant portion of our nonus operations are generally not subject to us tax other than withholding taxes our conclusions are based on among other things our determination that we and a significant portion of our foreign subsidiaries are not currently controlled foreign corporations cfc within the meaning of the us tax laws although the irs or a court may not concur with our conclusions a nonus corporation such as us will constitute a cfc for us federal income tax purposes if certain ownership criteria are met if the irs or a court determined that we or any of our nonus subsidiaries were a cfc then each of our us shareholders who own directly indirectly or constructively 10 or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock or the stock of any of our nonus subsidiaries on the last day of the applicable taxable year a “10 us voting shareholder” would be required to include in gross income for us federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of our subpart f and other similar types of income and the subpart f and other similar types of income of any of our subsidiaries determined to be a cfc for the period during which we and our nonus subsidiaries were a cfc in addition gain on the sale of our shares realized by such a shareholder may be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the shareholder’s proportionate share of our and our cfc subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings and profits accumulated during the shareholder’s holding period of the shares while we or any of our nonus subsidiaries are a cfc treatment of us or any of our nonus subsidiaries as a cfc could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

on july 20 2007 we received a notice from the irs containing proposed adjustments to our tax filings in connection with an audit of the 2001 and 2002 tax years the irs did not contest the validity of our reincorporation in bermuda the most significant adjustments proposed by the irs involve treating the entire intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in bermuda as equity as a result of this recharacterization the irs disallowed the deduction of interest paid on the debt and imposed dividend withholding taxes on the payments denominated as interest the irs also asserted an alternative argument to be applied if the intercompany debt is respected as debt in that circumstance the irs proposed to ignore the entities that hold the debt and to which the interest was paid and impose 30 withholding tax on a portion of the interest payments as if they were made directly to a company that was not eligible for reduced us withholding tax under a us income tax treaty the irs asserted under this alternative theory that we owe additional taxes with respect to 2002 of approximately 84 million plus interest if either of these positions were upheld in their entirety we would be required to record additional charges we strongly disagreed with the view of the irs and filed a protest with the irs in the third quarter of 2007 

on january 12 2010 we received an amended notice from the irs eliminating its assertion that the intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in bermuda should be treated as equity however the irs continues to assert the alternative position described above and proposes adjustments to our 2001 and 2002 tax filings in addition the irs provided notice on january 19 2010 that it is assessing penalties of 30 on the asserted underpayment of tax described above 

we have and intend to continue to vigorously contest these proposed adjustments we in consultation with our outside advisors carefully considered the form and substance of our intercompany financing arrangements including the actions necessary to qualify for the benefits of the applicable us income tax treaties we believe that these financing arrangements are in accordance with the laws of the relevant jurisdictions including the us that the entities involved should be respected and that the interest payments qualify for the us income tax treaty benefits claimed 

although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty based upon an analysis of the strength of our position we believe that we are adequately reserved for this matter as we move forward to resolve this matter with the irs it is reasonably possible that the reserves established may be adjusted however we do not expect that the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial position at this time the irs has not proposed any similar adjustments for years subsequent to 2002 however if all or a portion of these adjustments proposed by the irs are ultimately sustained it is likely to also affect subsequent tax years 

  

as noted above the irs did not contest the validity of the bermuda reorganization in the abovementioned notices we believe that neither we nor our consolidated subsidiary irnew jersey will incur significant us federal income or withholding taxes as a result of the transfer of the shares of our subsidiaries that occurred as part of the bermuda reorganization however we cannot give any assurances that the irs will agree with our determination 

the inability to realize any anticipated tax benefits related to our reorganizations could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

legislative and regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us 

our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the us tax authorities or any other tax authority from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions that if enacted could increase our tax burden and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for example the obama administration has recently announced various us tax legislative proposals that if adopted could adversely impact the company legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could potentially override us tax treaties upon which we rely broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident or modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments each of which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals whether in the us or another jurisdiction however if these or similar proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding the ireland reorganization limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between ireland and other jurisdictions including the united states modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country we could be subjected to increased taxation in addition any future amendments to current income tax treaties including between ireland and other jurisdictions including the united states could subject us to increased taxation 

also the us federal government and various states and municipalities have enacted or may enact legislation intended to deny government contracts to us companies that reincorporate outside of the us or have reincorporated outside of the us 

for instance the homeland security act of 2002 as amended includes a provision that prohibits “inverted domestic corporations” and their subsidiaries from entering into contracts with the department of homeland security in addition the state of california adopted legislation intended to limit the eligibility of certain nonus chartered companies to participate in certain state contracts more recently the 2008 2009 and 2010 consolidated appropriations acts prohibit any federal government agency from using funds appropriated by congress for fiscal years 2008 2009 and 2010 to pay an inverted domestic corporation or any of its subsidiaries for work performed or products provided under certain federal contracts “affected contracts” although the amount of monies already paid to us or to be paid to us under the affected contracts is not material to the company we cannot provide any assurance that the impact of future actions taken by the government in this area will not be materially adverse to our operations 

in addition there continues to be negative publicity regarding and criticism of companies that conduct business in the united states and in other countries but have changed their place of incorporation to another country 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear 

  

actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemptive rights with respect to any particular allotment of shares these authorizations must be renewed by the shareholders every five years and we cannot guarantee that these authorizations will always be approved 

a future transfer of our shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

in certain circumstances the transfer of shares in an irish incorporated company will be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired payable by the buyer although in the majority of transactions there will be no stamp duty because both the seller and buyer hold the shares beneficially this additional risk for the buyer could adversely affect the price of our shares although we currently intend to cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially our articles of association provide that in the event of any such payment we i may seek reimbursement from the transferor or transferee at our discretion ii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends payable to the transferor or transferee at our discretion and iii will have a lien against our shares on which we have paid stamp duty and any dividends paid on such shares 

our effective tax rate may increase notwithstanding the ireland reorganization 

while the ireland reorganization is not anticipated to have any material impact on our effective tax rate there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate which include the potential legislative actions described above and our effective tax rate may increase and any such increase may be material additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances as an irish tax resident company we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders resident in the united states will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could adversely affect the price of our shares 

  

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of our shares will generally not be subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in ingersoll rand 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in ingersoll rand

oil for food program and foreign corrupt practices act fcpa matters 

on november 10 2004 the securities and exchange commission sec issued an order directing that a number of public companies including the company provide information relating to their participation in transactions under the united nations’ oil for food program upon receipt of the order we undertook a thorough review of our participation in the oil for food program provided the sec with information responsive to the order and provided additional information requested by the sec on october 31 2007 we announced we had reached settlements with the sec and the department of justice doj relating to this matter under the terms of the settlements we paid a total of 67 million in penalties interest and disgorgement of profits we consented to the entry of a civil injunction in the sec action and entered into a threeyear deferred prosecution agreement dpa with the doj the dpa expired on october 31 2010 under both settlements we have implemented and will continue to implement improvements to our compliance program that are consistent with our longstanding policy against improper payments on february 16 2011 the doj filed a motion to dismiss the oil for food charges against us in its motion the doj noted that we fully cooperated with the investigation and that we had met our obligations regarding improving our compliance policies and procedures relating to the fcpa

tax related matters

certain whollyowned subsidiaries of the company are named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in state and federal courts in virtually all of the suits a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants the vast majority of those claims has been filed against either ingersoll rand company irnew jersey or trane and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by irnew jersey or trane primarily pumps boilers and railroad brake shoes neither irnew jersey nor trane was a producer or manufacturer of asbestos however some formerly manufactured products utilized asbestoscontaining components such as gaskets and packings purchased from thirdparty suppliers

ireland reorganization 

on march 5 2009 our board of directors approved a reorganization of the company that would change the jurisdiction of incorporation of our parent company from bermuda to ireland the first step in the ireland reorganization was the establishment of irlimited’s tax residency in ireland which occurred in march 2009 subsequently irireland replaced irlimited as the ultimate parent company pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under bermuda law the ireland reorganization was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control and accordingly did not result in any changes to the consolidated amounts of assets liabilities and equity as a result of the ireland reorganization irlimited became a whollyowned subsidiary of irireland and the class a common shareholders of irlimited became ordinary shareholders of irireland 

on july 1 2009 irlimited completed the transfer of all the outstanding shares of ingersollrand global holding company limited irglobal to ingersollrand international holding limited irinternational another whollyowned indirect subsidiary of irlimited incorporated in bermuda whereupon irinternational assumed the obligations of irlimited as an issuer or guarantor as the case may be under the indentures

trends and economic events 

we are a global corporation with worldwide operations as a global business our operations are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic factors as well as political factors wherever we operate or do business our geographic and industry diversity as well as the diversity of our product sales and services has helped limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results 

since the onset of the economic downturn in 2008 we have seen weaker demand for many of our products and services across each of our businesses consumers and businesses have reduced spending and investment as a result of the reduced endmarket activity we initiated restructuring actions at the end of 2008 targeted at streamlining the footprint of manufacturing facilities and reducing the general and administrative cost base across all of our businesses 

given the broad range of products manufactured and geographic markets served management uses a variety of factors to predict the outlook for the company we monitor key competitors and customers in order to gauge 

  

relative performance and the outlook for the future in addition our order rates are indicative of future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance in those industry segments where we are a capital equipment provider revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy 

during 2010 current market conditions continued to impact our financial results the us and european nonresidential construction markets remain weak however we experienced modest volume growth in some of our other major end markets as economic conditions continue to stabilize we expect this modest revenue growth to continue along with the continued benefits of restructuring savings and productivity programs 

despite the current market environment we have a solid foundation of global brands and leading market shares in all of our major product lines our growing geographic and industry diversity coupled with our large installed product base provides growth opportunities within our service parts and replacement revenue streams in addition we are investing substantial resources to innovate and develop new products and services which will fuel our future growth

healthcare reform 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act the act and the healthcare and education reconciliation bill of 2010 together with the act the healthcare reform legislation was signed into law as a result effective 2013 the tax benefits available to us will be reduced to the extent our prescription drug expenses are reimbursed under the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy program although the provisions of the healthcare reform legislation relating to the retiree drug subsidy program do not take effect until 2013 we are required to recognize the full accounting impact in our financial statements in the reporting period in which the healthcare reform legislation is enacted as retiree healthcare liabilities and related tax impacts are already reflected in our financial statements the healthcare reform legislation resulted in a noncash charge to income tax expense in the first quarter of 2010 of 405 million 

currently our retiree medical plans receive the retiree drug subsidy under medicare part d no later than 2014 a significant portion of the drug coverage will be moved to an employer group waiver plan while retaining the same benefit provisions this change resulted in an actuarial gain which decreased our december 31 2010 retiree medical plan liability as well as the net actuarial losses in other comprehensive income by 411 million at this time there were no other changes to our liabilities as a result of the healthcare reform legislation we will continue to monitor healthcare reform legislation to review provisions which could impact our accounting for retiree medical benefits in future periods we may consider future plan amendments which may have accounting implications as further regulations are promulgated and interpretations of the legislation become available 

the healthcare reform legislation could also impact our accounting for income taxes in future periods we will continue to assess the accounting implications of the healthcare reform legislation 

venezuela devaluation

 net revenues 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 increased by 75 or 9773 million compared with the same period of 2009 which primarily resulted from the following

liquidity 

the following table contains several key measures to gauge our financial condition and liquidity at the period ended december 31 

 

   

shortterm borrowings and current maturities of longterm debt consisted of the following 

 

 commercial paper program 

we use borrowings under our commercial paper program for general corporate purposes as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we had no amounts outstanding after repaying 9987 million during 2009 these payments were funded primarily using cash generated from our operations 

debentures with put feature 

at december 31 2010 and 2009 we had outstanding 3436 million of fixed rate debentures which only requires early repayment at the option of the holder these debentures contain a put feature that the holders may exercise on each anniversary of the issuance date if exercised we are obligated to repay in whole or in part at the holder’s option the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of the debentures held by the holder if these options are not exercised the final maturity dates would range between 2027 and 2028 

in 2010 holders of these debentures chose to exercise the put feature on less than 01 million of the outstanding debentures on february 15 2011 holders of these debentures had the option to exercise the put feature on 372 million of the outstanding debentures the holders chose not to exercise the put feature at that date based on our cash flow forecast we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to repay any amounts redeemable as a result of these put features 

exchangeable senior notes due 2012 

in april 2009 we issued 345 million of 45 exchangeable senior notes the notes through our whollyowned subsidiary irglobal the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of irireland irlimited and irinternational interest on the notes is paid twice a year in arrears in addition holders may exchange their notes at their option prior to november 15 2011 in accordance with specified circumstances set forth in the indenture agreement or anytime on or after november 15 2011 through their scheduled maturity in april 2012 

upon any exchange the notes will be paid in cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be exchanged the remainder due on the option feature if any will be paid in cash ordinary shares or a combination thereof at the option of the company the notes are subject to certain customary covenants however none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations 

we account for the notes in accordance with gaap which requires us to allocate the proceeds between debt and equity in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate we allocated approximately 305 million of the gross proceeds to debt with the remaining discount of approximately 40 million approximately 39 million after allocated fees recorded within equity additionally we are amortizing the discount into earnings over a threeyear period 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 the sales price condition set forth in the indenture agreement for the notes continues to be satisfied as a result the notes may be exchangeable at the holders’ option during the first quarter of 2011 therefore we classified the debt portion of the notes as shortterm in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2010 in addition we classified the equity portion of the notes as temporary equity to reflect the amount that could result in cash settlement at the balance sheet date 

  

longterm debt 

in august 2008 we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec for an indeterminate amount of securities for future issuance and issued 16 billion of longterm debt pursuant to the shelf registration statement through our whollyowned subsidiary irglobal approximately 14 billion remains outstanding as of december 31 2010 as the company repaid 250 million as it became due during 2010 the remaining balance consists of 600 million 6000 senior notes due in 2013 and 750 million 6875 senior notes due in 2018 these notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by irlimited the net proceeds from the offering were used to reduce the amount outstanding under the senior unsecured bridge loan facility 

interest on the fixed rate notes will be paid twice a year we have the option to redeem them in whole or in part at any time and from time to time prior to their stated maturity date at redemption prices set forth in the debt offering documents the notes are subject to certain customary covenants however none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations

pension plans 

our investment objectives in managing defined benefit plan assets are to ensure that present and future benefit obligations to all participants and beneficiaries are met as they become due to provide a total return that over the longterm minimizes our required contributions at the appropriate levels of risk and to meet any statutory or regulatory requirements

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 1790 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared with 1831 million in 2009 the change in investing activities is primarily attributable to a reduction in capital expenditures during 2010

as a part of the reorganization of irlimited in 2009 the guarantee structure was updated to reflect the newly created legal structure under which i irinternational assumed the obligations of irlimited as issuer or guarantor as the case may be and ii irireland and irlimited fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations under the various indentures covering the currently outstanding public debt of irinternational irglobal and irnew jersey neither irireland nor irlimited has issued or intends to issue guarantees in respect of any public indebtedness incurred by trane 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment periods in millions 

 

  includes 3436 million of debt redeemable at the option of the holder the scheduled maturities of these bonds range between 2027 and 2028 also includes 345 million related to the exchangeable senior notes due in 2012 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes environmental and asbestosrelated matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above 

pensions 

at december 31 2010 we had net obligations of 5509 million which consist of noncurrent pension assets of 51 million and current and noncurrent pension benefit liabilities of 556 million it is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required we currently project that we will contribute approximately 512 million to our plans worldwide in 2011 because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for pension obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

postretirement benefits other than pensions 

at december 31 2010 we had postretirement benefit obligations of 883 million we fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a payasyougo basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations benefit payments which are net of expected plan participant contributions and medicare part d subsidy are expected to be approximately 768 million in 2011 because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for postretirement obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income taxes 

at december 31 2010 we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of 5341 million and 1004 million of related accrued interest and penalties the liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits and internal revenue service irs tax disputes 

environmental and asbestos matters 

we are involved in various litigations claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

see note 11 and note 22 for additional information on matters affecting our liquidity 

  

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

 

  

 recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and determined using a two step process the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a second step is performed wherein the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value impairment exists and must be recognized 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is based on two valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model income approach and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues market approach with each method being equally weighted in the calculation in step 2 the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit 

recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible assets to the estimated fair value of the respective intangible assets any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess the calculation of estimated fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology income approach which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset 

the determination of estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill requires management to make assumptions about estimated cash flows including profit margins longterm forecasts discount rates and terminal growth rates management developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit 

  

2010 impairment test 

for our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2010 we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values 

the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates generally ranging from 115 to 18 and terminal growth rates generally ranging from 25 to 4 under the market approach management used an adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues based on the market information of comparable companies additionally management compared the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units to the company’s overall market capitalization 

for all reporting units except three the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 15 the three reporting units with a percentage of carrying value less than 15 reported within the climate solutions segment exceeded their carrying value by 44 94 and 108 these reporting units have goodwill of approximately 243 million 1075 million and 561 million respectively a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units 

2009 impairment test 

for our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2009 we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values 

the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates generally ranging from 11 to 15 and terminal growth rates generally ranging from 2 to 5 under the market approach management used an adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues based on the market information of comparable companies additionally management compared the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units to the company’s overall market capitalization 

for all reporting units except one the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 15 the one reporting unit with a percentage of carrying value less than 15 reported within the climate solutions segment exceeded its carrying value by 8 this reporting unit had goodwill of approximately 840 million a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which the company operates future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by the company and can raise issues regarding its filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which the company operates a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return the company believes that it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters the company will adjust its estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from the original or adjusted estimates of the company the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 

  

 changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the expected 2011 net periodic pension cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 102 million and the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 78 million a 025 rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would increase expected 2011 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by 08 million and a 10 increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the cost by approximately 19 million

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition to manage certain of those exposures we use derivative instruments primarily forward contracts derivative instruments utilized by us in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell their products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world we actively manage the currency exposures that are associated with purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities at the operating unit level exposures that cannot be naturally offset to an insignificant amount are hedged with foreign currency derivatives we also have nonus currency net asset exposures which we currently do not hedge with any derivative instrument 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2010 a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 decrease in exchange rates would result in an unrealized loss of approximately 535 million as compared with 684 million at december 31 2009 these amounts would be offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying currency transactions 

  

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have any committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2010 

interest rate exposure 

our debt portfolio mainly consists of fixedrate instruments and therefore any fluctuation in market interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations

ireland reorganization 

on march 5 2009 our board of directors approved a reorganization of the company that would change the jurisdiction of incorporation of our parent company from bermuda to ireland the ireland reorganization the first step in the ireland reorganization was the establishment of irlimited’s tax residency in ireland which occurred in march 2009 subsequently irireland replaced irlimited as the ultimate parent company pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under bermuda law the scheme of arrangement major milestones to complete the scheme of arrangement were as follows 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 on june 30 2009 irlimited filed the sanction order with the bermuda registrar of companies and at 1201 am on july 1 2009 the transaction time the following steps occurred simultaneously 

 

  

  

  

  

 as a result of the ireland reorganization irlimited became a whollyowned subsidiary of irireland and the class a common shareholders of irlimited became ordinary shareholders of irireland

business segments 

our business segments provide products services and solutions used to increase the efficiency and productivity of both industrial and commercial operations and homes as well as improve the security safety health and comfort of people around the world 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we realigned our external reporting structure to more closely reflect our corporate and business strategies and to promote additional productivity and growth our segments are now as follows climate solutions residential solutions industrial technologies and security technologies as part of the change we eliminated the air conditioning systems and services segment which represented the acquired trane business and created two new reportable segments the climate solutions segment and the residential solutions segment our business segments are as follows 

climate solutions 

our climate solutions segment delivers energyefficient refrigeration and heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac solutions throughout the world encompassing the transport and stationary refrigeration markets as well as the commercial hvac markets this segment offers customers a broad range of products services and solutions to manage controlled temperature environments this segment which had 2009 net revenues of 73 billion includes the market leading brands of hussmann thermo king and trane 

residential solutions 

our residential solutions segment provides safety comfort and efficiency to homeowners throughout north america and parts of south america it offers customers a broad range of products services and solutions including mechanical and electronic locks energyefficient hvac systems indoor air quality solutions advanced controls portable security systems and remote home management this segment which had 2009 net revenues of 20 billion is comprised of wellknown brands like american standard schlage and trane 

industrial technologies 

our industrial technologies segment provides products services and solutions that enhance energy efficiency productivity and operations it offers our global customers a diverse and innovative range of products including compressed air systems tools pumps fluid handling systems golf and utility vehicles in addition to environmentally friendly micro turbines this segment which had 2009 net revenues of 22 billion includes the club car and ingersoll rand marketleading brands 

  

  

security technologies 

our security technologies segment is a leading global provider of products and services that make environments safe secure and productive the segment’s marketleading products include electronic and biometric access control systems and software locks and locksets door closers exit devices steel doors and frames portable security devices as well as time attendance and personnel scheduling systems these products serve a wide range of markets including the commercial construction market healthcare retail maritime and transport industries as well as educational and governmental facilities this segment which had 2009 net revenues of 17 billion includes the cisa lcn schlage and von duprin brands 

products 

our principal products by business segment include the following 

 

  

  

   

  

 these products are sold primarily under our name and under other names including american standard ®  cisa ®  club car ®  hussmann ®  lcn ®  schlage ®  thermo king ®  von duprin ® and trane ®  

competitive conditions 

our products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world due to the diversity of these products and the variety of markets served we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line they include wellestablished regional or specialized competitors as well as larger us and nonus corporations or divisions of larger companies 

the principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price quality delivery service and support technology and innovation we believe that we are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of hvac systems and services air compression systems transport temperature control products refrigerated display merchandisers refrigeration systems and controls air tools and golf and utility vehicles in addition we believe we are a leading supplier in us markets for architectural hardware products mechanical locks and electronic and biometric accesscontrol technologies 

distribution 

our products are distributed by a number of methods which we believe are appropriate to the type of product us sales are made through branch sales offices and through distributors dealers and large retailers across the country nonus sales are made through numerous subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world 

customers 

we have no major customers that accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues in 2009 2008 or 2007 no material part of our business is dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers therefore the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our operations 

raw materials 

we manufacture many of the components included in our products which requires us to employ a wide variety of raw materials principal raw materials such as steel copper and aluminum are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world in the past higher prices for some raw materials particularly steel and nonferrous metals have caused pricing pressures in some of our businesses we have historically been able to pass certain of these cost increases on to customers in the form of price increases 

we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future there have been no raw material shortages which have had a material adverse effect on our businesses however significant changes in certain material costs may have an adverse impact on our costs and operating margins to mitigate this potential impact we enter into longterm supply contracts in order to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions 

working capital 

we manufacture products that usually must be readily available to meet our customer’s rapid delivery requirements therefore we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs and our customers’ requirements such working capital requirements are not however in the opinion of management materially different from those experienced by our major competitors our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors 

  

  

research and development 

we engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products enhance existing products effectiveness increase safety improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate in addition we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment or acquisition we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development activities as we look to maintain and improve our competitive position research and development expenditures including qualifying engineering costs were 2574 million in 2009 2046 million in 2008 and 1286 million in 2007 

patents and licenses 

we own numerous patents and patent applications and are licensed under others although in aggregate we consider our patents and licenses to be valuable to our operations we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single patent or license or any group of them in our opinion engineering production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our patents andor licenses 

operations by geographic area 

more than 35 of our 2009 net revenues were derived outside the us and we sold products in more than 100 countries therefore the attendant risks of manufacturing or selling in a particular country such as nationalization and establishment of common markets would not be expected to have a significant effect on our nonus operations for a discussion of risks attendant to our nonus operations see “risk factors – currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations may adversely affect our results” “risk factors – our global operations subject us to economic risks” in item 1a and “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in item 7a 

backlog 

our approximate backlog of orders believed to be firm at december 31 2009 and 2008 were as follows 

 

 these backlog figures are based on orders received while the major portion of our products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock orders for specialized machinery or specific customer application are submitted with extensive lead times and are often subject to revision deferral cancellation or termination we expect to ship substantially the entire backlog at december 31 2009 during 2010 

environmental matters 

we continue to be dedicated to an environmental program intended to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process as well as to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the environmental protection agency and similar state authorities we have been also identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based generally on the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future 

  

  

during 2009 we spent 108 million for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us as of december 31 2009 and 2008 we have recorded reserves for environmental matters of 933 million and 1009 million respectively we believe that these expenditures and accrual levels will continue and may increase over time given the evolving nature of environmental laws regulations and technology the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain 

for a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities see also part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental and asbestos matters and also note 23 to the consolidated financial statements 

asbestos matters 

certain whollyowned subsidiaries of the company are named as defendants in asbestosrelated lawsuits in state and federal courts in virtually all of the suits a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants the vast majority of those claims has been filed against either irnew jersey or trane and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by irnew jersey or trane primarily pumps boilers and railroad brake shoes neither irnew jersey nor trane was a producer or manufacturer of asbestos however some formerly manufactured products utilized asbestoscontaining components such as gaskets and packings purchased from third party suppliers 

see also the discussion under part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental and asbestos matters and also note 23 to the consolidated financial statements

furthermore we have reported to the doj and sec certain matters involving trane including one relating to the oil for food program and which raise potential issues under the fcpa and other applicable anticorruption laws with respect to these matters we have conducted a thorough investigation which began in earnest promptly after our acquisition of trane in june 2008 previously we had reported to the sec and doj potential fcpa issues relating to one of our businesses in china and we have reported back to them and shared with them our audit report which indicated no fcpa violations with respect to that same business in china we have discussed with the doj and sec another matter which raises potential fcpa issues we have had preliminary discussions concerning the foregoing with the sec and doj to be followed by further discussions about them and possibly other matters which raise potential fcpa concerns these matters and others which may arise or of which we become aware in the future may be deemed to violate the fcpa and other applicable anticorruption laws such determinations could subject us to among other things further enforcement actions by the sec or the doj if for example the doj deems us to have violated the dpa securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects and the market value of our stock 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including europe china brazil venezuela africa india and turkey these activities are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

more than 35 of our 2009 net revenues were derived outside the us and we expect sales to nonus customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues although we enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to currency exchange fluctuations changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations because we do not hedge against all of our currency exposure our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations 

  

  

furthermore the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar we have assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

we are also a large buyer of steel and nonferrous metals as well as other commodities required for the manufacture of our products volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows we may purchase commodity derivatives which reduce the volatility of the commodity prices for supplier contracts where fixed pricing is not available 

significant shortages in the raw materials we use in our businesses and higher energy prices could increase our operating costs 

we rely on suppliers to secure raw materials particularly steel and nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

additionally we are exposed to large fluctuations for the price of petroleumbased fuel due to the instability of current market prices higher energy costs increase our operating costs and the cost of shipping our products to customers around the world consequently sharp price increases the imposition of taxes or an interruption of supply could cause us to lose the ability to effectively manage the risk of rising fuel prices and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

changes in weather patterns and seasonal fluctuations may adversely affect certain segments of the company’s business and impact overall results of operations 

demand for certain segments of the company’s products and services is influenced by weather conditions for instance trane’s sales have historically tended to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because in the us and other northern hemisphere markets summer is the peak season for sales of air conditioning systems and services additionally while there is demand for trane’s products and services throughout the year a significant percentage of total sales are related to us residential and commercial construction activity which is generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year therefore results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unexpected cool trends or unseasonably warm trends during the summer season could negatively or positively affect certain segments of the company’s business and impact overall results of operations 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health 

we estimate that our available cash and our cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations for the foreseeable future in making this estimate we have not assumed the need to make any material payments in connection with any pending litigation or investigations as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings including current or future asbestosrelated litigation may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments which could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

  

such an outcome could have important consequences for example it could 

 

  

  

  

 if the distribution of wabco’s shares by trane on july 31 2007 were to fail to qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under section 355 of the internal revenue code the code then trane and trane’s shareholders who received wabco common stock in the distribution may be required to pay us federal income taxes 

on july 31 2007 trane then known as american standard companies inc completed the spinoff of its vehicle control systems business into a new publicly traded company named wabco at the time trane received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs substantially to the effect that the distribution qualified as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under section 355 of the code in addition trane received an opinion of skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp tax counsel to trane substantially to the effect that the distribution will qualify as taxfree to trane wabco and trane shareholders under section 355 and related provisions of the code the ruling and opinion were based on among other things certain assumptions as well as on the accuracy of certain factual representations and statements made by wabco and trane in rendering its ruling the irs also relied on certain covenants that trane and wabco entered into including the adherence to certain restrictions on wabco’s and trane’s future actions 

in connection with our acquisition of trane in june 2008 we received an opinion of simpson thacher  bartlett llp tax counsel to us substantially to the effect that the distribution should continue to qualify as taxfree to trane wabco and trane shareholders under section 355 and related provisions of the code notwithstanding receipt by trane and us of the private letter ruling as well as the opinions of counsel there can be no assurance that the irs will not later assert that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction 

if the distribution fails to qualify for taxfree treatment then trane would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of i the fair market value of wabco’s common stock distributed to the trane shareholders over ii trane’s tax basis in such common stock under the terms of the tax sharing agreement in the event the distribution were to fail to qualify as a taxfree reorganization and such failure was not the result of actions taken after the distribution by trane or any of its subsidiaries or shareholders wabco would be responsible for all taxes imposed on trane as a result thereof in addition each trane shareholder who received wabco common stock in the distribution generally would be treated as having received a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of wabco’s common stock received including any fractional share sold on behalf of the shareholder which would be taxable as a dividend to the extent of the shareholder’s ratable share of trane’s current and accumulated earnings and profits at the time as increased to reflect any current income including any gain recognized by trane on the taxable distribution the balance if any of the distribution would be treated as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the trane shareholder’s tax basis in its trane stock with any remaining amount being taxed as capital gain if wabco was unable to satisfy its obligations under the tax sharing agreement or if trane was unable to rely on the tax sharing agreement for any reason any potential liability arising from the distribution of wabco’s shares by trane could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

risks relating to our past reorganizations 

we effected a corporate reorganization in december 2001 to become a bermuda company the “bermuda reorganization” and a subsequent corporate reorganization in july 2009 to become an irish public limited company the “ireland reorganization” these reorganizations exposed us and our shareholders to the risks described below in addition we cannot be assured that all of the anticipated benefits of the reorganizations will be realized 

changes in tax laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under us or other tax laws or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our reorganizations could be impacted by changes in tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the us tax authorities or any other tax authority from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the us tax law that if enacted could increase our tax burden and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for instance recent legislative proposals would broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident which would significantly diminish the realization of any tax benefit related to our reorganizations there are other recent us tax legislative proposals that could modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position moreover other legislative proposals could potentially affect us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments by our us subsidiaries to our nonus affiliates which would adversely affect our effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation while we are currently monitoring these proposals and are investigating all options we could still be subject to increased us taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals are enacted andor certain tax treaties are amended 

while our us operations are subject to us tax we believe that a significant portion of our nonus operations are generally not subject to us tax other than withholding taxes our conclusions are based on among other things our determination that we and a significant portion of our foreign subsidiaries are not currently controlled foreign corporation’s cfc within the meaning of the us tax laws although the irs or a court may not concur with our conclusions a nonus corporation such as us will constitute a cfc for us federal income tax purposes if certain ownership criteria are met if the irs or a court determined that we or any of our nonus subsidiaries were a cfc then each of our us shareholders who own directly indirectly or constructively 10 or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock or the stock of any of our nonus subsidiaries on the last day of the applicable taxable year a “10 us voting shareholder” would be required to include in gross income for us federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of our subpart f and other similar types of income and the subpart f and other similar types of income of any of our subsidiaries determined to be a cfc for the period during which we and our nonus subsidiaries were a cfc in addition gain on the sale of our shares realized by such a shareholder may be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the shareholder’s proportionate share of our and our cfc subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings and profits accumulated during the shareholder’s holding period of the shares while we or any of our nonus subsidiaries are a cfc treatment of us or any of our nonus subsidiaries as a cfc could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

on july 20 2007 we received a notice from the irs containing proposed adjustments to our tax filings in connection with an audit of the 2001 and 2002 tax years the irs did not contest the validity of our reincorporation in bermuda the most significant adjustments proposed by the irs involve treating the entire intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in bermuda as equity as a result of this recharacterization the irs disallowed the deduction of interest paid on the debt and imposed dividend withholding taxes on the payments denominated as interest the irs also asserted an alternative argument to be applied if the intercompany debt is respected as debt in that circumstance the irs proposed to ignore the entities that hold the debt and to which the interest was paid and impose 30 withholding tax on a portion of the interest 

  

  

payments as if they were made directly to a company that was not eligible for reduced us withholding tax under a us income tax treaty the irs asserted under this alternative theory that we owe additional taxes with respect to 2002 of approximately 84 million plus interest if either of these positions were upheld in their entirety we would be required to record additional charges we strongly disagreed with the view of the irs and filed a protest with the irs in the third quarter of 2007 

on january 12 2010 we received an amended notice from the irs eliminating its assertion that the intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in bermuda should be treated as equity however the irs continues to assert the alternative position described above and proposes adjustments to our 2001 and 2002 tax filings in addition the irs provided notice on january 19 2010 that it is assessing penalties of 30 on the asserted underpayment of tax described above 

we have and intend to continue to vigorously contest these proposed adjustments we in consultation with our outside advisors carefully considered the form and substance of our intercompany financing arrangements including the actions necessary to qualify for the benefits of the applicable us income tax treaties we believe that these financing arrangements are in accordance with the laws of the relevant jurisdictions including the us that the entities involved should be respected and that the interest payments qualify for the us income tax treaty benefits claimed 

although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty based upon an analysis of the strength of our position we believe that we are adequately reserved for this matter as we move forward to resolve this matter with the irs it is reasonably possible that the reserves established may be adjusted however we do not expect that the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial position at this time the irs has not proposed any similar adjustments for years subsequent to 2002 however if all or a portion of these adjustments proposed by the irs are ultimately sustained it is likely to also affect subsequent tax years for a further discussion of the irs audit see “legal proceedings” and note 20 to our consolidated financial statements 

as noted above the irs did not contest the validity of the bermuda reorganization in the abovementioned notices we believe that neither we nor our consolidated subsidiary irnew jersey will incur significant us federal income or withholding taxes as a result of the transfer of the shares of our subsidiaries that occurred as part of the bermuda reorganization however we cannot give any assurances that the irs will agree with our determination 

the inability to realize any anticipated tax benefits related to our reorganizations could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

legislative and regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us 

our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the us tax authorities or any other tax authority from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the us tax law that if enacted could increase our tax burden and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for example the obama administration has recently announced various tax legislative proposals that if adopted could adversely impact the company legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could potentially override us tax treaties upon which we rely broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident or modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments each of which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if these or similar proposals that had the effect of disregarding the ireland reorganization limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between ireland and other jurisdictions including the united states or modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments were enacted we could be subjected to increased taxation in addition any future amendments to current income tax treaties including between ireland and other jurisdictions including the united states could subject us to increased taxation 

  

  

also the us federal government and various states and municipalities have enacted or may enact legislation intended to deny government contracts to us companies that reincorporate outside of the us or have reincorporated outside of the us 

for instance the homeland security act of 2002 as amended includes a provision that prohibits “inverted domestic corporations” and their subsidiaries from entering into contracts with the department of homeland security in addition the state of california adopted legislation intended to limit the eligibility of certain nonus chartered companies to participate in certain state contracts more recently the 2008 2009 and 2010 consolidated appropriations acts prohibit any federal government agency from using funds appropriated by congress for fiscal years 2008 2009 and 2010 to pay an inverted domestic corporation or any of its subsidiaries for work performed or products provided under certain federal contracts “affected contracts” although the amount of monies already paid to us or to be paid to us under the affected contracts is not material to the company we cannot provide any assurance that the impact of future actions taken by the government in this area will not be materially adverse to our operations 

in addition there continues to be negative publicity regarding and criticism of companies that conduct business in the united states and in other countries but have changed their place of incorporation to another country 

our effective tax rate may increase notwithstanding the ireland reorganization 

while the ireland reorganization is not anticipated to have any material impact on our effective tax rate there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate which include the potential legislative actions described above and our effective tax rate may increase and any such increase may be material additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances as an irish tax resident company we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders resident in the united states will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could adversely affect the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of our shares will generally not be subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in ingersoll rand 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in ingersoll rand 

a future transfer of our shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

in certain circumstances the transfer of shares in an irish incorporated company will be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired payable by the buyer although in the majority of transactions there will be no stamp duty because both the seller and buyer hold the shares beneficially this additional risk for the buyer could adversely affect the price of our shares although we currently intend to cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share 

  

  

transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially our articles of association provide that in the event of any such payment we i may seek reimbursement from the transferor or transferee at our discretion ii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends payable to the transferor or transferee at our discretion and iii will have a lien against our shares on which we have paid stamp duty and any dividends paid on such shares 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemptive rights with respect to any particular allotment of shares these authorizations must be renewed by the shareholders every five years and we cannot guarantee that these authorizations will always be approved

oil for food program and foreign corrupt practices act fcpa matters 

as previously reported on november 10 2004 the securities and exchange commission sec issued an order directing that a number of public companies including the company provide information relating to their participation in transactions under the united nations’ oil for food program upon receipt of the order the company undertook a thorough review of its participation in the oil for food program provided the sec with information responsive to the order and provided additional information requested by the sec during a march 27 2007 meeting with the sec at which a representative of the department of justice doj was also present the company began discussions concerning the resolution of this matter with both the sec and doj on october 31 2007 the company announced it had reached settlements with the sec and doj relating to this matter under the terms of the settlements the company paid a total of 67 million in penalties interest and disgorgement of profits the company has consented to the entry of a civil injunction in the sec action and has entered into a threeyear deferred prosecution agreement dpa with the doj under both settlements the company has implemented and will continue to implement improvements to its compliance program that are consistent with its longstanding policy against improper payments in the settlement documents the government noted that the company thoroughly cooperated with the investigation that the company had conducted its own complete investigation of the conduct at issue promptly and thoroughly reported its findings to them and took prompt remedial measures 

additionally we have reported to the doj and sec certain matters involving trane including one relating to the oil for food program and which raise potential issues under the fcpa and other applicable anticorruption laws with respect to these matters we have conducted a thorough investigation which began in earnest promptly after our acquisition of trane in june 2008 previously we had reported to the sec and doj potential fcpa issues relating to one of our businesses in china and we have reported back to them and shared our audit report which indicated no fcpa violations with respect to that same business in china we have discussed with the doj and sec another matter which raises potential fcpa issues we have had preliminary discussions concerning the foregoing with the sec and doj to be followed by further discussions about them and possibly other matters which raise potential fcpa concerns these matters and others which may arise or of which we become aware in the future may be deemed to violate the fcpa and other applicable anticorruption laws such determinations could subject us to among other things further enforcement actions by the sec or the doj if for example the doj deems us to have violated the dpa securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects and the market value of our stock 

  

  

the european commission investigation 

in november 2004 trane was contacted by the european commission as part of a multicompany investigation into possible infringement of european union competition law relating to the distribution of bathroom fixtures and fittings in certain european countries on march 28 2007 trane along with a number of other companies received a statement of objections from the european commission the statement of objections an administrative complaint alleges infringements of european union competition rules by numerous bathroom fixture and fittings companies including trane and certain of its former european subsidiaries engaged in the bath and kitchen business these former subsidiaries were transferred i to wabco on july 31 2007 as part of a legal reorganization in connection with the spinoff of trane’s vehicle control systems business and ii to bain capital partners llc on october 31 2007 in connection with the sale of trane’s bath  kitchen business trane and certain of its former european subsidiaries will be jointly and severally liable for any fines that result from the investigation however pursuant to an indemnification and cooperation agreement among trane and certain other parties indemnification agreement american standard europe bvba renamed wabco europe bvba wabco europe which is a subsidiary of wabco following the reorganization will be responsible for and will indemnify trane and its subsidiaries including certain subsidiaries formerly engaged in the bath and kitchen business and their respective affiliates against any fines related to this investigation trane and the charged subsidiaries responded to the european commission on august 1 2007 and july 31 2007 respectively a hearing with the european commission regarding the response to the statement of objections was conducted from november 1214 2007 in brussels wabco europe and other former trane subsidiaries participated in the hearing trane however did not participate in the hearing 

in 2006 the european commission adopted new fining guidelines 2006 guidelines and stated its intention to apply these guidelines in all cases in which a statement of objections is issued after september 2006 in applying the 2006 guidelines the commission retains considerable discretion in calculating the fine although the european union regulations provide for a cap on the maximum fine equal to ten percent of trane’s worldwide revenue attributable to all of its products for the fiscal year prior to the year in which the fine is imposed if the maximum fine is levied in 2010 the total liability could be as high as 11 billion based on trane’s last full fiscal year of worldwide revenue attributable to all of its businesses owned at the time the statement of objections was issued subject to a probable reduction for leniency of at least 20 percent provided wabco europe as the leniency applicant fulfilled all conditions set forth in the european commission’s leniency notice wabco has stated in its form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2009 that its ability to satisfy its obligations under the indemnification agreement is contingent on its funding capability at the time of the fine which could be affected by among other things its ability to access its then existing credit facilities its ability to obtain alternative sources of financing its ability to obtain some payment relief from the european commission or its ability to obtain a suspension of the payment obligation from the european court of first instance 

tax related matters 

on july 20 2007 we received a notice from the irs containing proposed adjustments to our tax filings in connection with an audit of the 2001 and 2002 tax years the irs did not contest the validity of our reincorporation in bermuda the most significant adjustments proposed by the irs involve treating the entire intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in bermuda as equity as a result of this recharacterization the irs disallowed the deduction of interest paid on the debt and imposed dividend withholding taxes on the payments denominated as interest the irs also asserted an alternative argument to be applied if the intercompany debt is respected as debt in that circumstance the irs proposed to ignore the entities that hold the debt and to which the interest was paid and impose 30 withholding tax on a portion of the interest payments as if they were made directly to a company that was not eligible for reduced us withholding tax under a us income tax treaty the irs asserted under this alternative theory that we owe additional taxes with respect to 2002 of approximately 84 million plus interest if either of these positions were upheld in their entirety we would be required to record additional charges we strongly disagreed with the view of the irs and filed a protest with the irs in the third quarter of 2007

trends and economic events 

we are a global corporation with worldwide operations as a global business our operations are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic factors as well as political factors wherever we operate or do business our geographic and industry diversity as well as the diversity of our product sales and services has helped limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results 

since the onset of the economic downturn in 2008 we have seen weaker demand for many of our products and services although the challenging and difficult end market environments in which we operate are showing signs of stabilization albeit at lower levels we are still operating in a depressed economic climate 

despite the challenging economic environment we continue to execute our business strategy the divestiture of both compact equipment and the road development business unit in 2007 in addition to the acquisition of trane in 2008 have enabled us to become more balanced across the products we offer in addition our current enterprisewide restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2008 are designed to streamline the footprint of our manufacturing facilities and reduce our general and administrative cost base 

given the broad range of products manufactured and geographic markets served management uses a variety of factors to predict the outlook for the company we monitor key competitors and customers in order to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future in addition our order rates are indicative of future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance in those industry segments where we are a capital equipment provider revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy 

for 2010 we expect current market conditions to continue to impact our financial results us and european nonresidential construction markets are expected to remain weak however some of our end markets are showing signs of stabilization 

despite the current market environment we have a solid foundation of global brands and leading market shares in all of our major product lines our growing geographic and industry diversity coupled with our large installed product base provides growth opportunities within our service parts and replacement revenue streams in addition we are investing substantial resources to innovate and develop new products and services which will fuel our future growth

during 2009 we completed a comprehensive financing program that significantly enhanced our liquidity and debt profile actions taken include the issuance of 10 billion in longterm debt senior notes and exchangeable senior notes in april 2009 and the replacement of our trane accounts receivable purchase program in march 2009 with a new accounts receivable purchase program that encompassed originators from all four of our business segments the proceeds from our debt issuance were used to repay the 9500 million outstanding under our senior unsecured bridge loan facility 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we initiated enterprisewide restructuring actions in order to streamline both our manufacturing footprint and our general and administrative cost base we have incurred approximately 1821 million of costs associated with our restructuring programs since the fourth quarter of 2008 1114 million of which occurred during 2009 these combined restructuring actions generated approximately 194 million of annual pretax savings for 2009 

significant events in 2008 

as discussed in acquisition of trane above on june 5 2008 we acquired 100 of the outstanding common shares of trane for approximately 96 billion

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we tested goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment as a result of decreased global equity valuations the tightening of industrial and retail end markets and a resulting decline in our 2009 projected financial performance we incurred a noncash pretax impairment charge of 37100 million 33850 million aftertax

other net 

the yearoveryear changes in other net primarily resulted from the following 

 

 for the year ended december 31 2009 other net decreased by 435 million compared with the same period of 2008 the decrease was primarily related to lower interest income as a result of lower average cash balances during the year the decrease was partially offset by lower exchange losses in 2009 in addition we recorded income of approximately 25 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily related to a favorable settlement with an insurance carrier associated with a portion of our asbestos obligation the settlement is included in other in the table above 

included in currency exchange gains losses above is a 24 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009 associated with the recent devaluation in the venezuelan bolivar at december 31 2009 we remeasured our foreign currency receivables and payables associated with the venezuelan bolivar at the parallel rate of 60 bolivars for each us dollar based on our inability to settle certain transactions through the official government channels in an expeditious manner previously we remeasured all foreign currency transactions at the official rate of 215 bolivars for each us dollar in addition effective january 1 2010 venezuela has been designated highly inflationary as the blended consumer price indexnational consumer price index reached cumulative threeyear inflation in excess of 100 during the fourth quarter of 2009 as such all future foreign currency fluctuations will be recorded in income 

for the year ended december 31 2008 other net increased by 330 million compared with the same period of 2007 the increase was a result of greater interest income generated by higher average cash balances prior to the acquisition of trane in june 2008 the increase was partially offset by currency losses due to significant volatility in currency exchange rates predominately in the fourth quarter 

provision for income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2009 the effective tax rate was 128 compared to 75 in 2008 the 2009 tax rate was below the us statutory rate of 350 primarily due to earnings in nonus jurisdictions which in aggregate have a lower effective rate the 53 point increase in the effective rate is primarily the result of an increase in valuation allowances as well as changes in earnings mix offset by a reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

for the year ended december 31 2008 the effective tax rate was 75 the tax rate was substantially below the us statutory rate of 350 primarily due to the large impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter as well as earnings in nonus jurisdictions which in aggregate have a lower effective rate excluding the impairment charge the adjusted effective rate would have been 124 compared with an effective rate of 218 in 2007 the 94 point reduction in the effective rate is primarily the result of lower earnings in high tax jurisdiction during 2008 see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of tax matters 

review of business segments 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we realigned our external reporting structure to more closely reflect our corporate and business strategies and to promote additional productivity and growth our segments are now as follows climate solutions residential solutions industrial technologies and security technologies as part of the 

  

  

change we eliminated the air conditioning systems and services segment which represented the acquired trane business and created two new reportable segments the climate solutions segment and the residential solutions segment see note 24 in the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the segment realignment

2009 vs 2008 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 increased by 80 or 5431 million compared with the same period of 2008 which primarily resulted from the following 

 

 net revenues in the trane commercial hvac business increased 15222 million compared with the same period of 2008 the increase which represented 225 of the segment’s yearoveryear increase was a consequence of 2008 reported results only reflecting activity since the acquisition date 

net revenues in the transport and stationary refrigeration business decreased 292 or 9791 million compared with the same period of 2008 the decrease which had a 145 impact on the segment’s yearoveryear results was primarily due to lower volumes and product mix 14 and an unfavorable currency impact 1 these reductions were slightly offset by improved pricing 1 

trane commercial hvac revenues were impacted by a continued decline in activity in nonresidential construction markets in all major geographic areas except asia both equipment and service revenue as well as parts services and solutions were impacted by the decrease in end market activity net revenues in our transport 

  

  

and stationary refrigeration businesses decreased primarily as a result of the continued decline in the heavy truck market in europe however improved activity in the us and asian refrigerated trailer and truck markets during the fourth quarter helped to mitigate the declines in europe in addition seagoing container revenues and worldwide bus revenues have begun to improve in the fourth quarter due to an increase in end market activity worldwide display cases and contracting revenue were impacted by continued slower supermarket capital expenditures in both the us and europe 

operating income for the year ended december 31 2009 increased by 11787 million compared with the same period of 2008 this increase was a result of a noncash charge of 12400 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to the impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets excluding the impairment which had an 183 point impact on 2008 operating margins yearoveryear operating income decreased 131 or 613 million

2008 vs 2007 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 increased by 1002 or 33782 million compared with the same period of 2007 the dramatic yearoveryear increase was a result of the inclusion of the trane commercial hvac business since the acquisition date in 2008 operating results which totaled 33938 million for the period excluding the results of trane net revenues decreased by 05 or 156 million compared with the same period in 2007 the slight decrease in the yearoveryear results were primarily due to lower volumes 4 offset by a favorable currency impact 3 and improved pricing 

net revenues for the trane commercial hvac businesses decreased in both domestic and international markets increased revenues for parts services and solutions were more than offset by a decline in equipment revenue net revenues for our transport and stationary refrigeration business decreased primarily as a result of the decline in the truck market which decreased refrigerated trailer and truck revenues in north america and europe in addition seagoing container revenues as well as bus and aftermarket revenues also decreased as a result of slower end market activity worldwide display cases and contracting revenue decreased due to declines in display case sales to regional supermarkets in the us and a sharp decline in the installation business however sales of the tripac ® auxiliary unit continued to experience substantial growth in 2008 

  

  

operating income for the year ended december 31 2008 decreased by 11544 million compared to the same period of 2007 in the fourth quarter we recognized a noncash charge of 12400 million related to the impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets within the segment the charge had an 183 point impact on operating margins in 2008

we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents balance the cash generated by our operations our committed credit lines as well as our expected ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs for the foreseeable future 

liquidity 

the following table contains several key measures to gauge our financial condition and liquidity at the period ended december 31 

 

 the large cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2007 is attributable to the sale of both the compact equipment and the road development business units during 2007 which generated proceeds of 61543 million the lower cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2008 is a result of the acquisition of trane 

  

  

shortterm borrowings and current maturities of longterm debt consisted of the following 

 

 commercial paper program 

we use borrowings under our commercial paper program for general corporate purposes as of december 31 2009 we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings after paying down 9987 million during 2009 we funded these payments primarily using cash generated from operations

as of december 31 2008 our outstanding balance of the senior unsecured bridge loan facility was 754 million after a 196 million payment in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the first quarter of 2009 we borrowed an additional 196 million under the facility increasing the outstanding balance to 9500 million as of march 31 2009 we repaid the outstanding balance in april 2009 with proceeds from our longterm debt issuance as discussed below and terminated the facility 

debentures with put feature 

at december 31 2007 we had outstanding 5479 million of fixed rate debentures which only requires early repayment at the option of the holder these debentures contain a put feature that the holders may exercise on each anniversary of the issuance date if exercised we are obligated to repay in whole or in part at the holder’s option the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of the debentures held by the holder if these options are not fully exercised the final maturity dates would range between 2027 and 2028 

in 2008 holders of these debentures chose to exercise the put feature on 2022 million of the debentures as a result approximately 3457 million remained outstanding as of december 31 2008 in 2009 holders of these debentures chose to exercise the put feature on 21 million of the remaining debentures as a result approximately 3436 million remained outstanding at december 31 2009 in february 2010 holders of these debentures have the option to exercise the put feature on 372 million of the outstanding debentures based on our cash flow forecast we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to repay any amounts redeemable as a result of these put features 

longterm debt

we allocated the proceeds of the exchangeable notes between debt and equity in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate we allocated approximately 305 million of the gross proceeds to debt with the remaining discount of approximately 40 million approximately 39 million after allocated fees recorded within equity additionally we will amortize the discount into earnings over a threeyear period 

accounts receivable purchase program 

on march 31 2009 we expanded our existing trane accounts receivable purchase program and replaced it with a new accounts receivable purchase program that encompassed originators from all four of our business segments the increase in originators allowed us to increase the program size from 150 million to 325 million at december 31 2009 the outstanding balance of eligible trade receivables sold to an affiliated master special purpose vehicle was 5442 million however no net interests have been sold to any of the three conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions in the first quarter of 2010 we expect to terminate the new accounts receivable purchase program prior to its expiration in march 2010 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the program

postretirement benefits other than pensions 

at december 31 2009 we had postretirement benefit obligations of 9794 million we fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a payasyougo basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations benefit payments which are net of expected plan participant contributions and medicare part d subsidy are expected to be approximately 79 million in 2010 because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for postretirement obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

environmental and asbestos matters 

we are involved in various litigations claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

see note 13 and note 23 for additional information on matters affecting our liquidity 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

 

  

 recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and determined using a two step process the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a second step is performed wherein the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value impairment exists and must be recognized 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is based on two valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model income approach and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues market approach with each method being equally weighted in the calculation in step 2 the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit 

  

  

recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible assets to the estimated fair value of the respective intangible assets any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess the calculation of estimated fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology income approach which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset 

the determination of estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill requires management to make assumptions about estimated cash flows including profit margins longterm forecasts discount rates and terminal growth rates management developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit 

2009 impairment test 

for our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2009 we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values 

the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates generally ranging from 11 to 15 and terminal growth rates generally ranging from 2 to 5 under the market approach management used an adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues based on the market information of comparable companies additionally management compared the estimate aggregate fair value of its reporting units to the company’s overall market capitalization 

for all reporting units except one the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 15 the one reporting unit with a percentage of carrying value less than 15 reported within the climate solutions segment exceeded its carrying value by 8 this reporting unit has goodwill of approximately 840 million a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 

2008 impairment test 

due to the deterioration in the worldwide equity and credit markets and a tightening of industrial and retail end markets in the fourth quarter of 2008 the company’s market capitalization declined well below its book value in addition the weakening worldwide economic conditions resulted in our projected 2009 financial performance decline as a result the company updated its impairment testing through december 31 2008 based on the estimated fair value and book value of our reporting units we recorded an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 of approximately 37100 million 33850 million aftertax 

the assumptions used represent management’s best estimate of fair value under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates generally ranging from 1115 and terminal growth rates generally ranging from 25 under the market approach management used an adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues based on the market information of comparable companies additionally management compared the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units to the company’s overall market capitalization 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 effective january 1 2007 the company adopted the provisions of fasb asc 740 “income taxes” asc 740 which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return additionally asc 740 

  

  

provides guidance on the recognition classification accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 

the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which the company operates future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by the company and can raise issues regarding its filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which the company operates a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return the company believes that it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters the company will adjust its estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from the original or adjusted estimates of the company the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 

 

 changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the net periodic pension cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 96 million and the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 64 million a 025 rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would increase net periodic postretirement benefit cost by 08 million and a 10 increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the cost by approximately 20 million 

the preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts included in the company’s consolidated financial statements if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates the revisions are included in the company’s results for the period in which the actual amounts become known historically the aggregate differences if any between the company’s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition to manage certain of those exposures we use derivative instruments primarily forward contracts derivative instruments utilized by us in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell their products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world we actively manage the currency exposures that are associated with purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities at the operating unit level exposures that cannot be naturally offset within an operating unit to an insignificant amount are hedged with foreign currency derivatives we also have nonus currency net asset exposures which we currently do not hedge with any derivative instrument 

  

  

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential gain or loss in fair value based on a percentage increase or decrease in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2009 a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 increase in exchange rates would result in an unrealized gain of approximately 691 million as compared with an unrealized gain of 239 million at december 31 2008 these amounts would be offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying currency transactions 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have any committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2009 

interest rate exposure 

our debt portfolio mainly consists of fixedrate instruments and therefore any fluctuation in market interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations
