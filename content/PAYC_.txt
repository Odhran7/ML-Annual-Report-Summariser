overview

we are a leading provider of a comprehensive cloudbased human capital management “hcm” solution delivered as softwareasaservice “saas” we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment lifecycle from recruitment to retirement our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions including talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and human resources “hr” management applications our userfriendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees enabling selfmanagement of their hcm activities in the cloud which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity

we were founded in 1998 and became a publicly traded company through our initial public offering in 2014 since our founding we have focused on providing an innovative saas hcm solution organizations need sophisticated flexible and intuitive applications that can quickly adapt to their evolving hcm requirements streamline their hr processes and systems and enable them to control costs we believe the hcm needs of most organizations are currently served either by multiple providers in an attempt to replicate a comprehensive saas product or to a lesser extent by legacy providers offering outdated onpremise products these approaches often result in challenges with system integration and data integrity low scalability high costs extended delivery times and large upfront capital requirements 

because our solution was developed inhouse and is based on a single platform there is no need for our clients to integrate update or access multiple databases which are common issues with competitor offerings that use multiple thirdparty systems in order to link together their hcm offerings additionally our solution maintains data integrity for accurate actionable and realtime analytics and business intelligence and helps clients minimize the risks of compliance errors due to inaccurate or missing information we deliver featurerich applications while maintaining excellence in information security and quality management standards as evidenced by our international organization for standardization “iso” certifications

we sell our solution directly through our internally trained clientfocused and highly skilled sales force based in offices across the united states as a part of our client retention effort a specialist within a dedicated team is assigned to each client to provide industryleading personalized service we have approximately 33900 clients none of which constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 we believe that as a result of our focus on client experience we enjoy high client satisfaction as evidenced by an annual revenue retention rate of 94 93 and 93 from existing clients for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we believe our revenue retention rate understates our client loyalty because this rate is decreased by former clients that were acquired or otherwise ceased operations

we currently derive the majority of our revenues from our payroll applications we generally do not separately track our revenues across our other applications because we often sell applications in various groupings and configurations for a single price

the paycom solution

we offer an endtoend saas hcm solution that provides our clients and their employees with immediate access to accurate and secure information and analytics at any time from any location where internet service is available we believe our solution delivers the following benefits

softwareasaservice delivery model

our saas delivery model allows clients with geographically dispersed and mobile workforces to operate more efficiently and allows these clients to implement access and use our clientoriented internet solution on demand and remotely through standard web browsers smart phones tablets and other webenabled devices our saas solution reduces the time risk headcount and costs associated with installing and maintaining applications for onpremise products within the information technology “it” infrastructure of our clients

secure cloudbased architecture

our cloudbased architecture allows our solution to be implemented remotely with minimal client interaction updates such as software enhancements and newly developed applications can be deployed without client interaction disruption or involvement allowing our clients to make a smaller investment in hardware personnel implementation time and consulting additionally we own and maintain all of the infrastructure technology to host our solution and to maximize system availability for clients our focus on and investment in technology and data security has been recognized with isoiec 270012013 certified security standards that provide our clients with a “bestinclass” level of data security

scalability to grow with our clients

our solution is highly scalable we serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one employee to many thousands of employees while our target client size range is 50 to 10000 employees we calculate the number of clients’ employees based on 

 

 

 

parent company grouping our clients are able to use the same solution while their businesses grow by deploying applications asneeded in realtime pricing is determined b ased on employee headcount and the number of applications utilized enabling our clients to align hcm spending with their evolving hcm needs as compared to traditional hcm products that require clients to migrate to new software as they grow but retain fixed costs even if the client shrinks in size 

efficient and productive research and development

we believe we benefit from a competitive advantage with our research and development investments people and processes early investments in our proprietary cloudbased architecture enable us to develop and deploy applications in a timely and costeffective manner we have also chosen to base our research and development team in oklahoma and texas which we believe provides us with highquality talent at a lower cost compared to other locations in the united states where there is more competition for technology talent these strategic decisions have enabled us to have a highly productive research and development function

our strategy for growth 

our strategy is to continue to establish our solution as the hcm industry standard by increasing our presence in existing markets and expanding into additional markets we intend to continue to increase our domestic sales capacity as well as potentially expand over the longer term into international markets we will also execute our strategy for growth by targeting larger clients expanding our inside sales organization and strengthening and extending our solution 

increase our presence in existing markets

we believe a significant market opportunity exists to increase our presence within markets where we currently have a sales office each outside sales office is typically staffed with one sales team with each team comprised of a sales manager and approximately six to eight other sales professionals although we have a sales office in 40 of the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas “msas” in the united states based on july 2020 us census bureau estimates only seven of these msas are currently served by multiple paycom sales teams we plan to further penetrate and more effectively capture existing markets by adding sales offices leveraging virtual sales meetings and increasing the number of sales teams in such markets

expand into additional markets

we plan to continue expanding our sales capability by opening sales offices and leveraging virtual sales meetings in certain metropolitan areas where we currently have no sales teams we have historically selected new locations based on potential client and employee demographics as well as business density when opening a new sales office we typically relocate a proven sales manager from an existing territory who then recruits a team of highperforming sales representatives it typically takes a new sales office 24 months to reach maturity 

enlarge our existing client relationships

we dedicate our resources to helping our clients facilitate their goals whether through helping our clients execute better hiring decisions manage compensation more effectively or simply operate more efficiently we believe a significant growth opportunity exists in selling additional applications to our current clients many clients have subsequently deployed additional applications as they recognize the benefits of our comprehensive solution as we extend and enhance the functionality of our solution we will continue to invest in initiatives to increase the adoption of our solution and maintain our high levels of client satisfaction

target larger clients and capture incremental small business demand

the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations and increased the number of applications we offer we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost to us to further capitalize on this opportunity we intend to continue targeting larger businesses opportunistically where our current sales model is effective 

we also receive inbound leads from businesses below our target client size range who can be onboarded through our inside sales organization we intend to continue to expand our inside sales capabilities to opportunistically capture inbound demand for our solution

maintain our leadership in innovation by strengthening and extending our solution

our ability to develop and deploy new applications and updates rapidly and costeffectively has been integral to the results that we have achieved to date we intend to continue extending the functionality and range of our solution in the future our development efforts are performed exclusively inhouse and are heavily based upon proactive research and client input we are focusing our investments on the development of new applications enhancements and learning courses that are responsive to the needs of our clients which are garnered through ongoing client interaction and collaboration

our clients

we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry we have approximately 33900 clients or approximately 17700 clients based on parent company grouping none of which constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 we stored data for over 57 million persons employed by our clients during the year ended december 31 2021

many small to midsized companies can typically make the decision to adopt our solution more quickly than larger companies which we believe results in a shorter sales cycle and more closely corresponds to our target sales cycle of 30 to 90 days as a result of the nature and size of our clientele we maintain a diversified client base and very low revenue concentration among our clients we believe however that larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients we serve and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost as we attract clients at the higher end of our target client size range we may face longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales 

competition 

the market for hcm solutions is rapidly evolving highly competitive and subject to changing technology shifting client needs and frequent introduction of new products and services our competitors range from small regional firms to large wellestablished international firms with multiple product offerings

we compete with firms that provide hcm solutions by various means many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software but as demand for greater flexibility and access to information grows we believe there will be increased competition in the delivery of hcm cloudbased solutions by other saas providers our competitors offer hcm solutions that may overlap with one several or all categories of applications and include companies such as automatic data processing inc ceridian hcm holding inc cornerstone ondemand inc intuit inc insperity inc oracle corporation paychex inc paylocity holding corporation paycor hcm inc sap se servicenow inc ultimate kronos group workday inc and other local and regional providers 

competition in the hcm solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation breadth of service application offering and price the importance of these factors depends on the size of the business price tends to be the most important factor of competition for smaller businesses with fewer employees while the scope of features and customization is more important to larger businesses regardless of a company’s size another important factor is the implementation experience as all organizations are seeking a streamlined and simplified process 

sales and marketing

we generate client leads and demo requests accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs that target senior finance and hr executives technology professionals and senior business leaders of companies that perform hcm functions inhouse or outsource these functions to one of our competitors our marketing programs include







we sell our solution exclusively through our captive sales force substantially all of whom have a fouryear college degree we typically recruit sales candidates who have sales experience in nonhcm industries or with respect to candidates recruited directly from colleges and universities who have demonstrated an aptitude for sales our sales force is comprised of inside sales and field sales personnel who are organized geographically and client relations representatives “crrs” who sell additional applications to existing clients as of the filing of this form 10k we have 55 sales teams including one team consisting of crrs and inside sales representatives located in 28 states and plan to open additional sales offices to further expand our market presence 

when a new client processes payroll with us for an entire month our sales representative receives a onetime commission based upon an estimate of future annual revenues from such client executive sales representatives receive a higher commission rate and base salary based upon both current year and careertodate realized sales

in addition to managing client relationships our crrs are focused on expanding the number of applications our clients purchase from us by introducing them to additional applications when an existing client purchases and then utilizes a new application for one payroll cycle a crr receives a onetime commission based upon an estimate of future annual revenues from such client

risk factors

tableend

the risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this form 10k including those risks identified in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” describe examples of risks uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statement if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect actual outcomes may vary materially from those included in this form 10k

risks related to our business

if our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to our clients’ or their employees’ sensitive data is otherwise obtained our solution may not be perceived as being secure clients may reduce the use of or stop using our solution our ability to attract new clients may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities

our solution involves the collection storage and transmission of clients’ and their employees’ confidential and proprietary information including personal identifying information as well as financial and payroll data hcm software is often targeted in cyberattacks including computer viruses worms phishing attacks malicious software programs and other information security breaches which could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our clients’ sensitive data or otherwise disrupt our clients’ or other third parties’ business operations if cybercriminals are able to circumvent our security measures or if we are unable to detect an intrusion into our systems and contain such intrusion in a reasonable amount of time our clients’ sensitive data may be compromised

certain of our employees have access to sensitive information about our clients’ employees while we conduct background checks of our employees and limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls resulting in a security breach 

although we have security measures in place to protect client information and prevent data loss and other security breaches these measures could be breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error thirdparty or employee malfeasance or otherwise because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently we may not be able to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative or protective measures while we currently maintain a cyber liability insurance policy cyber liability insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our cyber liability insurance policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention from our business and operations

any actual or perceived breach of our security could damage our reputation cause existing clients to discontinue the use of our solution prevent us from attracting new clients or subject us to thirdparty lawsuits regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

any damage failure or disruption of our saas network infrastructure or data centers could impair our ability to effectively provide our solution harm our reputation and adversely affect our business

our saas network infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations our clients access our solution through standard web browsers smart phones tablets and other webenabled devices and depend on us for fast and reliable access to our solution we serve all of our clients from our three fully redundant data centers located in oklahoma and texas our saas network infrastructure and data centers are vulnerable to damage failure and disruption 

in the future we may experience issues with our computing and communications infrastructure or data centers caused by the following factors





 

 

 

 













if our saas network infrastructure or our clients’ ability to access our solution is interrupted client and employee data from recent transactions may be permanently lost and we could be exposed to significant claims by clients particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds payable to employees or tax authorities further any adverse changes in service levels at our data centers resulting from damage to or failure of our data centers could result in disruptions in our services any significant instances of system downtime or performance problems at our data centers could negatively affect our reputation and ability to attract new clients prevent us from gaining new or additional business from our current clients or cause our current clients to terminate their use of our solution any of which would adversely impact our revenues in addition if our network infrastructure and data centers fail to support increased capacity due to growth in our business our clients may experience interruptions in the availability of our solution such interruptions may reduce our revenues cause us to issue refunds to clients or adversely affect our retention of existing clients any of which could have a negative impact on our business operating results or financial condition

if we are not able to develop enhancements and new applications keep pace with technological developments or respond to future disruptive technologies we might not remain competitive and our business could be adversely affected

our continued success will depend on our ability to adapt and innovate in order to attract new clients and increase revenues from existing clients we need to enhance add new features to and improve our existing applications and introduce new applications the success of any enhancements or new features and applications depends on several factors including timely completion and introduction and market acceptance we may expend significant time and resources developing and pursuing sales of a particular enhancement or application that may not result in revenues in the anticipated time frame or at all or may not result in revenue growth sufficient to offset increased expenses further changing legal and regulatory requirements may delay the development or introduction of enhancements or new applications or render certain of our applications obsolete if we are unable to successfully develop enhancements new features or new applications to meet client needs our business and operating results could be adversely affected

in addition because our applications are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using internet tools and protocols we must continuously modify and enhance our applications to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies if we are unable to respond in a timely and costeffective manner to these rapid technological developments our current and future applications may become less marketable and less competitive or even obsolete

our success is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver hcm solutions at lower prices more efficiently or more conveniently such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete

the market in which we participate is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected

the market for hcm software is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented we expect competition to intensify in the future with the introduction of new technologies and new market entrants many of our current and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition longer operating histories more established relationships in the industry and significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as a result some of these competitors may be able to







 

 

 













some of our principal competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures similarly some competitors offer different billing terms which has resulted in pressures on our billing terms if we are unable to maintain our pricing levels and our billing terms our operating results would be negatively impacted in addition pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales reduced margins losses or the failure of our solution to maintain widespread market acceptance any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

we compete with firms that provide hcm solutions by various means many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software but as demand for greater flexibility and access to information grows we believe there will be increased competition in the delivery of hcm cloudbased solutions by other saas providers our competitors offer hcm solutions that may overlap with one several or all categories of applications and include companies such as automatic data processing inc ceridian hcm holding inc cornerstone ondemand inc intuit inc insperity inc oracle corporation paychex inc paylocity holding corporation paycor hcm inc sap se servicenow inc ultimate kronos group workday inc and other local and regional providers 

competition in the hcm solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness application quality and reputation breadth of service and product offering and price many of our competitors have established marketing relationships access to larger client bases and major distribution agreements with consultants software vendors and distributors in addition some competitors may offer software that addresses one or a limited number of hcm functions at a lower price point or with greater depth than our solution further some potential clients particularly large enterprises may elect to develop their own internal solutions if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected

our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our deployment or technical support services or if our solution fails to perform properly

our business depends on our ability to satisfy our clients both with respect to our applications and the technical support provided to help our clients use the applications that address the needs of their businesses we use our inhouse deployment personnel to implement and configure our solution and provide support to our clients if a client is not satisfied with the quality of our solution the applications delivered or the support provided we could incur additional costs to address the situation our profitability might be negatively affected and the client’s dissatisfaction with our deployment or support service could harm our ability to sell additional applications to that client in addition our sales process is highly dependent on the reputation of our solution and applications and on positive recommendations from our existing clients our clients have no obligation to continue to use our applications and may choose not to continue to use our applications at the same or higher level of service if at all moreover our clients generally have the right to cancel their agreements with us for any or no reason by providing 30 days’ prior written notice in the past some of our clients have elected not to continue to use our applications any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality technical support could adversely affect client retention our reputation our ability to sell our applications to existing and prospective clients and as a result our business operating results or financial condition 

further our solution is inherently complex and may in the future contain or develop undetected defects or errors any defects in our applications could adversely affect our reputation impair our ability to sell our applications in the future and result in significant costs to us the costs incurred in correcting any application defects may be substantial and could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition any defects in functionality or defects that cause interruptions in the availability of our applications could result in 











 

 

 

 





because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our applications could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our clients regard as significant our clients might assert claims against us in the future alleging that they suffered damages due to a defect error or other failure of our solution our errors and omissions insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention any failures in the performance of our solution could harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients which would have an adverse impact on our business operating results or financial condition

the market for our solution among large companies may be limited if these companies demand customized features and functions that we do not offer

prospective clients especially larger companies may require customized features and functions unique to their business processes that we do not offer in order to ensure we meet these requirements we may devote a significant amount of support and service resources to larger prospective clients increasing the cost and time required to complete sales with no guarantee that these prospective clients will adopt our solution further we may not be successful in implementing any customized features or functions if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we do not offer or that would be difficult for them to deploy themselves the market for our solution will be more limited and our business could be adversely affected

we are dependent on the continued service of our key executives and if we fail to retain such key executives our business could be adversely affected

we believe that our success depends in part on the continued services of our key executives consisting of chad richison craig e boelte jon evans bradley s smith and holly faurot our business could be adversely affected if we fail to retain these key executives although the employment arrangements of certain of our key executives contain restrictive covenants our business could nonetheless be adversely affected if a key executive leaves paycom and interferes with paycom’s client employee andor other business relationships in addition we have not purchased key person life insurance on any of our key executives 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel including software developers and skilled it sales marketing and operational personnel our ability to develop and market new and existing products and in turn increase our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected

our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new applications as a result we are heavily dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified software developers and it personnel with the requisite education background and industry experience in addition to continue to execute our growth strategy we must also attract and retain qualified sales marketing and operational personnel capable of supporting a larger and more diverse client base the software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors this competition for qualified personnel may be amplified by new immigration laws or policies that could limit software companies’ ability to recruit internationally although such changes in immigration laws or policies would not have a significant direct impact on our workforce the ensuing increase in demand for software developers and it personnel could impair our ability to attract or retain skilled employees andor significantly increase our costs to do so furthermore identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use of our applications requires significant time expense and attention and it can take a substantial amount of time before our employees are fully trained and productive the loss of the services of a significant number of employees could be disruptive to our development efforts which may adversely affect our business by causing us to lose clients increase operating expenses or divert management’s attention to recruit replacements for the departed employees

 

 

 

the failure to develop and maintain our brand costeffectively could have an adverse effect on our business 

we believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a costeffective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our solution and is an important element in attracting new clients and retaining existing clients successful promotion of our brand depends largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful applications at competitive prices brand promotion activities including increased spending on our national media campaigns may not yield increased revenues and even if they do any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brand if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand we may fail to attract enough new clients or retain our existing clients to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding efforts which could have an adverse effect on our business

if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights our competitive advantage could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets generate reduced revenues or incur costly litigation to protect our rights

our success is dependent in part upon our intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and to protect our intellectual property rights in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions however the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our applications and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products or services that compete with ours

we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property we have been involved in litigation in the past and litigation may be necessary in the future to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets such litigation could be costly timeconsuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights we may not be able to secure protect and enforce our intellectual property rights or control access to and the distribution of our solution and proprietary information which could adversely affect our business

we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights

considerable intellectual property development activity exists in our industry and we expect that software developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of applications and competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps our competitors as well as a number of other entities and individuals may own or claim to own intellectual property in technology areas relating to our solution or applications in addition we may increasingly be subject to trademark infringement claims as our presence grows in the marketplace from time to time third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights a claim of infringement may also be made relating to technology that we acquire or license from third parties however we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover or may be alleged to cover some or all of our solution applications or brands

the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable and as a result any future litigation or claim of infringement could i cause us to enter into an unfavorable royalty or license agreement pay ongoing royalties or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms ii require us to discontinue the sale of our solution or applications iii require us to indemnify our clients or thirdparty service providers or iv require us to expend additional development resources to redesign our solution or applications any of these outcomes could harm our business even if we were to prevail any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business and operations

the use of open source software in our applications may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property rights

some of our applications use software covered by open source licenses from time to time there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate such software into their products or applications as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software litigation could be costly for us to defend have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional development resources to change our applications in addition if we were to combine our applications with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain of the open source licenses be required to release the source code of our applications if we inappropriately use open source software we may be required to redesign our applications discontinue the sale of our applications or take other remedial actions which could adversely impact our business operating results or financial condition

 

 

 

we employ thirdparty licensed software for use in our applications and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs or reduced service levels which could adversely affect our business 

our applications incorporate certain thirdparty software obtained under licenses from other companies we anticipate that we will continue to rely on such thirdparty software and development tools from third parties in the future although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the thirdparty software we currently license this may not always be the case or it may be difficult or costly to replace in addition incorporating the software used in our applications with new thirdparty software may require significant work and substantial investment of our time and resources also to the extent that our applications depend upon the successful operation of thirdparty software in conjunction with our software any undetected errors or defects in this thirdparty software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our applications delay new application introductions result in a failure of our applications and harm our reputation

we may acquire other businesses applications or technologies which could divert our management’s attention result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results

in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses applications or technologies that we believe complement or expand our applications enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities the pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur expenses in identifying investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions whether or not they are ultimately consummated

we do not have any experience in acquiring other businesses if we acquire additional businesses we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel operations and technologies successfully or to effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition we also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors including























in addition a significant portion of the purchase price of any companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets which must be assessed for impairment at least annually in the future if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process which could harm our results of operations acquisitions could also result in issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt which would result in dilution to our stockholders

our business depends in part on the success of our relationships with third parties

we rely on thirdparty couriers financial and accounting processing systems and various financial institutions to deliver payroll checks and tax forms perform financial services in connection with our applications such as providing automated clearing house “ach” and wire transfers as part of our payroll and tax payment services and to provide technology and content support manufacture time clocks and process background checks we anticipate that we will continue to depend on various thirdparty relationships in order to grow our business provide technology and content support manufacture time clocks process background checks and deliver payroll checks and tax forms identifying negotiating and documenting relationships with these third parties and integrating thirdparty content and technology requires significant time and resources our agreements with third parties typically are nonexclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors in addition these third parties may not perform as expected under our agreements and we may have disagreements or disputes with such third parties which could negatively affect our 

 

 

 

brand and reputation a global economic slowdown could also adversely affect the businesses of our thirdparty providers hindering their ability to provide the services on which we rely further a disruption of the federal reserve bank’s services including ach processing could negatively affect our payroll and expense reimbursement services by delaying direct deposits and other financial transactions across the united states if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected even if we are successful these relationships may not result in improved operating results 

because our longterm success may depend in part on our ability to expand the sales of our solution to clients located outside of the united states our business could be subject to risks associated with international operations

an element of our growth strategy is to expand our operations and client base to date we have not engaged in any operations outside of the united states if we decide to expand our operations into international markets it will require significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory economic and political risks that are different from those in the united states because of our lack of experience with international operations we cannot ensure that our international expansion efforts will be successful and the impact of such expansion efforts may adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

legal and regulatory risks

changes in laws government regulations and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

many of our applications are designed to assist our clients in complying with government regulations that continually change the introduction of new regulatory requirements or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations could increase our cost of doing business for example there have been and may continue to be a significant number of new laws and regulations promulgated by federal state and local governments following the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic we have expended additional resources and incurred additional costs in addressing the regulatory requirements applicable to us and our clients more generally changing regulatory requirements may make the introduction of new applications and enhancements more costly or more timeconsuming than we currently anticipate or could prevent the introduction of new applications and enhancements by us altogether changes in laws regulations or policies could also affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for certain of our existing applications or services which would result in decreased revenues further we may spend time and money developing new applications and enhancements that due to regulatory changes become unnecessary prior to being released in addition any failure to educate and assist our clients with respect to new or revised legislation that impacts them could have an adverse effect on our reputation and any failure to modify our applications or develop new applications in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations additionally new regulations or changes to existing regulations could be unclear difficult to interpret or conflict with other applicable regulations our or our clients’ failure to comply with new or modified laws or regulations could result in financial penalties legal proceedings or reputational harm finally a negative audit or other investigations by the us government could adversely affect our ability to receive us government contracts and our future operating performance and could result in financial or reputational harm 

in addition federal state and foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet as a commercial medium changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our applications further government agencies or private organizations may impose taxes fees or other charges for accessing the internet or commerce conducted via the internet these laws or charges could limit the growth of internetrelated commerce or communications generally or could result in reductions in the demand for internetbased applications such as ours

privacy concerns and laws or other regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our applications 

our applications and services are subject to various complex laws and regulations on the federal state and local levels including those governing data security and privacy which have become significant issues globally the regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future many federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information in the united states these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca the financial services modernization act of 1999 federal and state labor and employment laws and state data breach notification laws and state privacy laws such as the new york stop hacks and improve electronic data security shield act the ibipa and the ccpa the ibipa includes a private right of action for persons who are aggrieved by violations of the ibipa the ccpa provides consumers with a private right of action if covered companies suffer a data breach related to their failure to implement reasonable security measures the ccpa gives california consumers certain rights to be informed of and delete the personal information that we hold similar to those provided by the european union’s gdpr further because some of our clients have establishments internationally the gdpr and other foreign data privacy laws may impact our processing of certain client and 

 

 

 

employee information failure to comply with data protection and privacy laws and regulations could result in regulatory scrutiny and increased exposure to the risk of litigation or the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition moreover allegations of noncompliance whether or not true could be costly time consuming distracting to management and cause reputational harm  

the cpra which expands upon the ccpa and was passed in california in 2020 is scheduled to go into effect in 2023 virginia and colorado recently passed their own consumer data privacy statutes modeled on the ccpa which are also scheduled to go into effect in 2023 in addition there are a number of other legislative proposals worldwide including in the united states at both the federal and state level that could impose additional and potentially conflicting obligations in areas affecting our business newlypassed legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the ability of our clients to process handle store use and transmit demographic and personal information from their employees which could reduce demand for our solution 

in addition to government regulation privacy advocates and industry groups may propose and adopt new and different selfregulatory standards because the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws are still uncertain it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our solution any failure to comply with government regulations that apply to our applications including privacy and data protection laws could subject us to liability in addition to the possibility of fines lawsuits and other claims we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our solution which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition any inability to adequately address privacy concerns and claims even if unfounded or inability to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws regulations and policies could result in additional cost and liability to us damage to our reputation reductions in our sales and other adverse effects on our business operating results or financial condition

furthermore privacy concerns may cause our clients’ employees to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our clients and their employees to use our applications and services effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our applications and services in certain industries 

the adoption of new or adverse interpretations of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes could subject us to additional regulation and related expenses and require changes to our business

the adoption of new money transmitter or money services business statutes in jurisdictions changes in regulators’ interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes or regulations or disagreements by regulatory authorities with our interpretation of such statutes or regulations could subject us to registration or licensing or limit business activities until we are appropriately licensed these occurrences could also require changes to the manner in which we conduct certain aspects of our business or invest client funds which could adversely impact the amount of interest income we receive from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities and accounts designated by our clients

while we maintain that we are not a money services business or money transmitter we have adopted an antimoney laundering “aml” compliance program to mitigate the risk of our application being used for illegal or illicit activity and to help detect and prevent fraud our aml compliance program is designed to foster trust in our application and services 

we are registered as a “money services business” in one jurisdiction and intend to apply for licenses in others should other state or federal regulators make a determination that we have operated as an unlicensed money services business or money transmitter we could be subject to civil and criminal fines penalties costs of registration legal fees reputational damage or other negative consequences all of which may have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition

our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth and organizational change if we fail to manage such growth and change effectively we may be unable to execute our business plan maintain high levels of service or adequately address competitive challenges

we have experienced and may continue to experience rapid growth in our headcount and operations which has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management operational and financial resources we have also experienced significant growth in the number of clients and transactions and the amount of client and employee data that our infrastructure supports as a result our organizational structure and recording systems and procedures are becoming more complex as we improve our operational financial and management controls our success depends in part on our ability to manage this growth and organizational change effectively to manage the expected growth of our headcount and operations we must continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures the failure to effectively manage growth could result in declines in the quality of or client satisfaction with our applications increases in costs difficulties or delays in introducing new applications or other operational difficulties any of which could adversely affect our business by impairing our ability to retain and attract clients or sell additional applications to our existing clients 

 

 

 

further we need to continue to expand our inside and outside sales force and support team members in order to grow our client base and increase our revenues  o ur ability to add additional offices may be constrained by the covid19 pandemic the willingness and availability of qualified personnel to staff and manage any new offices and our success in recruiting and training sales personnel in those new offices if our expansion efforts are unsuccessful our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 

adverse tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our clients which could increase the costs of our solution and applications and could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

as a vendor of services we are ordinarily held responsible by taxing authorities for collecting and paying any applicable sales or other similar taxes additionally the application of federal state and local tax laws to services provided electronically like ours is evolving new income sales use or other tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time possibly with retroactive effect and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services and applications provided over the internet these enactments could adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and ultimately could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that change over time we review these rules and regulations periodically and when we believe we are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state we may voluntarily engage state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with that state’s rules and regulations we cannot ensure that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we currently believe no such taxes are required 

in addition existing tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be interpreted changed modified or applied adversely to us possibly with retroactive effect which could require us or our clients to pay additional tax amounts as well as require us or our clients to pay fines or penalties and substantial interest for past amounts if we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our clients we could be held liable for such costs thereby adversely affecting our business operating results or financial condition additionally the imposition of such taxes on us would effectively increase the cost of our software and services we provide to clients and would likely have a negative impact on our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the jurisdictions in which such taxes are imposed

the modification or repeal of certain provisions of the aca could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we generate acarelated revenues i on an annual basis in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients and ii from clients who have purchased our enhanced aca application as part of the fixed bundled price charged per billing period the modification or repeal of certain provisions of the aca could harm our business operating results and financial condition if the aca is modified to eliminate the employer reporting requirements or if the aca is repealed and replaced with new legislation that does not include similar employer reporting requirements we will no longer generate revenues in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients while we generally do not track our revenues on an applicationbyapplication basis because applications are often sold in various groupings and configurations for a single price we estimate that if the aca is not modified or repealed revenues from our enhanced aca application and aca forms filings business will represent approximately 2 of total projected revenues for the year ending december 31 2022 further uncertainty regarding the potential future modification repeal or replacement of the aca could adversely affect our ability to sell our enhanced aca application to new clients

industry and financial risks

our financial results may fluctuate due to many factors some of which may be beyond our control

our results of operations including our revenues costs of revenues administrative expenses operating income cash flow and deferred revenue may vary significantly in the future and the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance fluctuations in our financial results may negatively impact the value of our common stock our financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control and as a result may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate from period to period include without limitation  







 

 

 

 































certain of our operating results and financial metrics may be difficult to predict as a result of seasonality

we have historically experienced seasonality in our revenues a significant portion of our recurring revenues relate to the annual processing of payroll tax filing forms such as form w2 and form 1099 and the annual processing and filing of acarelated forms these forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year and as a result positively impact first quarter recurring revenues in addition unscheduled payroll runs at the end of the year such as bonuses have a positive impact on our recurring revenues in the fourth quarter although we expect the magnitude of seasonal fluctuations in our revenues to decrease in the future to the extent clients utilize more of our nonpayroll applications seasonal fluctuations in certain of our operating results and financial metrics may make such results and metrics difficult to predict

our outstanding indebtedness is subject to certain operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities and may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business

we have incurred indebtedness to fund certain construction projects at our corporate headquarters pursuant to the terms of our outstanding indebtedness we may not subject to certain exceptions

















 

 

 

 



in addition we are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” to fixed charges defined as current maturities of longterm debt interest expense rent expense and distributions of not less than 125 to 10 and a funded indebtedness defined as total indebtedness less accounts payable accrued expenses and deferred revenues to ebitda of not greater than 20 to 10 the operating and financial covenants in the loan agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into may restrict our ability to finance our operations engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies we may also be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on our debt which would reduce the amount of money available for operations working capital expansion or other general corporate purposes

our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations and comply with the operating and financial covenants may be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to control many of these factors and comply with these covenants a breach of any of the covenants under our loan agreements could result in an event of default which could cause all of our outstanding indebtedness to become immediately due and payable

if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings

we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as of december 31 2021 we had recorded a total of 519 million of goodwill and 580 million of other intangible assets net an adverse change in domestic or global market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of our critical assumptions or estimates made in connection with the impairment testing of goodwill or intangible assets could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge to our goodwill or other intangible assets any such material charges may have a negative impact on our operating results or financial condition

we may pay employees and taxing authorities amounts due for a payroll period before a client’s electronic funds transfers are finally settled to our account if client payments are rejected by banking institutions or otherwise fail to clear into our accounts we may require additional sources of shortterm liquidity and our operating results could be adversely affected

our payroll processing application moves significant funds from the account of a client to employees and relevant taxing authorities for larger funding amounts we require clients to transfer the funds to us via fed wire for smaller funding amounts we debit a client’s account prior to any disbursement on its behalf and due to ach banking regulations funds previously credited could be reversed under certain circumstances and time frames after our payment of amounts due to employees and taxing and other regulatory authorities there is therefore a risk that the employer’s funds will be insufficient to cover the amounts we have already paid on its behalf while such shortage and accompanying financial exposure has only occurred in very limited circumstances in the past should clients default on their payment obligations in the future we might be required to advance substantial funds to cover such obligations in such an event we may be required to seek additional sources of shortterm liquidity which may not be available on reasonable terms if at all and our operating results and our liquidity could be adversely affected and our banking relationships could be harmed

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected

as a public company we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements management must evaluate and furnish a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and our auditors must attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting

if we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports andor we could become subject to investigations by the new york stock exchange the “nyse” the sec or other regulatory authorities and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected

our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance

we have released and may continue to release guidance in our earnings conference calls earnings releases or otherwise regarding our future performance which represents our estimates as of the date of release this guidance which includes forwardlooking statements has been and will be based on projections prepared by our management these projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants and neither our 

 

 

 

registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections accordingly no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections 

projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that while presented with numerical specificity are inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control projections are also based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions some of which will change the principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any third parties

guidance is necessarily speculative in nature and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will vary significantly from actual results accordingly our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material in light of the foregoing investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock

any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this “risk factors” section in this form 10k could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance and the differences may be adverse and material

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

generally accepted accounting principles in the united states are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change

risks related to ownership of our securities

the issuance of additional stock in connection with acquisitions our stock incentive plans warrants or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to one hundred million shares of common stock and up to ten million shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations we may issue all of these shares that are not already outstanding without any action or approval by our stockholders we intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions in the future we may pay for such acquisitions in part or in full through the issuance of additional equity securities

any issuance of shares in connection with an acquisition the exercise of stock options or warrants the award of shares of restricted stock or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by our existing stockholders

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management

any provision of our certificate of incorporation bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

our certificate of incorporation contains an exclusive forum provision that may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers

our certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if no court of chancery located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or other employees to us or our stockholders any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of delaware law or our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws as either may be amended from time to time or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in addition this exclusive forum selection provision will not apply to claims under the exchange act moreover section 22 of the securities act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the securities act or the rules and regulations thereunder accordingly there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce our forum selection provision as written 

 

 

 

in connection with claims arising under the securities act this forum selection provision may limit our stockholders ’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us it is also possible that notwithstanding the forum selection clause included in our certificate of incorporation a court could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable 

general risks

the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity

the global spread of the novel coronavirus covid19 has created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption individually and collectively the consequences of the covid19 pandemic could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity the extent to which the covid19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to



our clients are sensitive to negative changes in economic conditions across many industries temporary and permanent business closures as well as business occupancy limitations resulted in significant layoffs and employee furloughs beginning in late march 2020 because we charge our clients on a peremployee basis for certain services we provide our recurring revenue has been negatively impacted by headcount reductions among our client base 

in order to spur economic activity to counteract the adverse effects of the covid19 pandemic the federal open market committee lowered its target for the federal funds rate in march 2020 due to significantly lower average interest rates in 2021 as compared to 2020 interest earned on funds held for clients for the year ended december 31 2021 decreased from the year ended december 31 2020 which had a negative effect on recurring revenue growth we expect that the foregoing adverse economic factors will continue to have a negative impact on recurring revenues in future periods for so long as such conditions persist further the impact of the pandemic on our recurring revenues combined with our deliberate increased level of investment to drive the growth of our business may negatively affect net income 

beginning in february 2020 we took various actions in order to minimize the risk of covid19 to our employees our clients and the communities in which we operate in march 2020 we began transitioning our employees to workfromhome arrangements during the fourth quarter of 2021 the majority of our employees returned to our offices we may implement workfromhome arrangements again if we determine that such arrangements are in the best interests of our employees or if such arrangements are required by government authorities remote work arrangements may create increased operational risk including data security risk as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruptions in typical operations our sales employees have been conducting meetings with current and prospective clients virtually since march 2020 but as prospective clients begin to take meetings inperson we expect our sales process to include a combination of virtual and inperson meetings if clients and client prospects are not as willing or available to engage via video conference and teleconference this shift in our sales process could negatively affect our sales efforts impede client acquisition and lengthen our sales cycles which would negatively impact our business and results of operations and could impact our financial condition in the future

even after the covid19 outbreak has subsided depending upon its duration and frequency of recurrence the emergence of different covid19 variants and the governmental policies in response thereto we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact including any recession that may occur or be continuing as a result we continue to monitor and evaluate the extent to which covid19 has impacted us and our employees and clients and the extent to which it and other emerging developments are expected to impact us in the future 

 

 

 

adverse economic and market conditions could affect our business operating results or financial condition 

our business depends on the overall demand for hcm applications and on the economic health of our current and prospective clients if economic conditions in the united states or in global markets deteriorate clients may cease their operations eliminate or reduce unscheduled payroll runs such as bonuses reduce headcount delay or reduce their spending on hcm and other outsourcing services or attempt to renegotiate their contracts with us an economic decline could result in reductions in sales of our applications decreased revenue from unscheduled payroll runs and fees charged on a peremployee basis longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition in addition hcm spending levels may not increase following any recovery

in recent years there have been several instances when there has been uncertainty regarding the ability of congress and the president collectively to reach agreement on federal budgetary and spending matters a period of failure to reach agreement on these matters particularly if accompanied by an actual or threatened government shutdown may have an adverse impact on the us economy additionally because certain of our clients rely on government resources to fund their operations a prolonged government shutdown may affect such clients’ ability to make timely payments to us which could adversely affect our operations results or financial condition 

further as part of our payroll and tax filing application we collect and then remit client funds to taxing authorities and accounts designated by our clients during the interval between receipt and disbursement we may invest such funds in money market funds demand deposit accounts certificates of deposit and commercial paper these investments are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks and such risks may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility any loss of or inability to access such funds could have an adverse impact on our cash position and results of operations and could require us to obtain additional sources of liquidity which may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us if at all

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with management’s perspective on our financial condition results of operations liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this “form 10k” the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” for a discussion of the uncertainties risks and assumptions associated with those statements actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in the section entitled “risk factors” unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires the terms “we” “us” “our” and the “company” refer to paycom software inc and its consolidated subsidiaries all amounts presented in tables other than per share amounts are in thousands unless otherwise noted

overview 

we are a leading provider of a comprehensive cloudbased human capital management “hcm” solution delivered as softwareasaservice we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment lifecycle from recruitment to retirement our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions including talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and human resources management applications our userfriendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees enabling selfmanagement of their hcm activities in the cloud which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity

we generate revenues from i fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed and ii fixed amounts charged per billing period we do not require clients to enter into longterm contractual commitments with us our billing period varies by client based on when each client pays its employees which may be weekly biweekly semimonthly or monthly we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry none of our clients constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 our revenues are primarily generated through our sales force that solicits new clients and our client relations representatives who sell new applications to existing clients

our continued growth depends on attracting new clients through further penetration of our existing markets and geographic expansion into new markets targeting a high degree of client employee usage across our solution and introducing new applications to our existing client base we believe our ability to continue to develop new applications and to improve existing applications will enable us to increase revenues in the future and the number of our new applications adopted by our clients has been a significant factor in our revenue growth in january 2022 we added new sales teams in las vegas jacksonville new england and south jersey bringing our total to 55 sales teams including one team consisting of crrs and inside sales representatives located in 28 states we plan to open additional sales offices in the future and leverage virtual sales meetings to further expand our market presence

our principal marketing efforts include national and local advertising campaigns email campaigns social and digital media campaigns search engine marketing methods tradeshows print advertising and outbound marketing including personalized direct mail campaigns in addition we generate leads and build recognition of our brand and thought leadership with relevant and informative content such as white papers blogs podcast episodes and webinars

throughout our history we have built strong relationships with our clients as the hcm needs of our clients evolve we believe that we are wellpositioned to expand the hcm spending of our clients and we believe this opportunity is significant to be successful we must continue to demonstrate the operational and economic benefits of our solution as well as effectively hire train motivate and retain qualified personnel

 

 

 

growth outlook opportunities and challenges 

as a result of our significant revenue growth and geographic expansion we are presented with a variety of opportunities and challenges our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications consequently we have historically generated the majority of our revenues from our payroll applications although our revenue mix has evolved and will continue to evolve as we develop and add new nonpayroll applications to our solution we believe our strategy of focusing on increased employee usage is key to longterm client satisfaction and client retention client adoption of new applications and client employee usage of both new and existing applications have been significant factors in our revenue growth and we expect the continuation of this trajectory will depend in part on the introduction of applications to our existing client base that encourage and promote more employee usage moreover in order to increase revenues and continue to improve our operating results we must also attract new clients we intend to obtain new clients by i continuing to leverage our sales force productivity within markets where we currently have existing sales offices ii expanding our presence in metropolitan areas where we currently have an existing sales office through adding sales teams or offices thereby increasing the number of sales professionals within such markets and iii opening sales offices in new metropolitan areas 

our target client size range is 50 to 10000 employees while we continue to serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one employee to many thousands of employees the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations increased the number of applications we offer and gained traction with larger companies we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of potential clients and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost to us because we charge our clients on a per employee basis for certain services we provide any increase or decrease in the number of employees of our clients will have a positive or negative impact respectively on our results of operations as discussed in more detail below client headcount fluctuations are particularly relevant in light of the ongoing covid19 pandemic generally we expect that changes in certain factors affecting our performance will correlate with improvement or deterioration in the labor market

based on our total revenues we have grown at a 25 compound annual growth rate from january 1 2018 through december 31 2021 growing our business has resulted in and will continue to result in substantial investments in sales professionals operating expenses system development and programming costs and general and administrative expenses which have increased and will continue to increase our expenses specifically our revenue growth and geographic expansion drive increases in our employee headcount which in turn precipitates increases in i salaries and benefits ii stockbased compensation expense and iii facility costs related to the expansion of our corporate headquarters and operations facilities and additional sales office leases

we believe the challenges of managing the everchanging complexity of payroll and human resources will continue to drive companies to turn to outsourced providers for help with their hcm needs the hcm industry historically has been driven in part by legislation and regulatory action including cobra changes to the minimum wage laws or overtime rules and legislation from federal state or municipal taxation authorities the implementation of the affordable care act the “aca” is an example of legislation that has created demand in the hcm industry we generate acarelated revenues i on an annual basis in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients and ii from clients who have purchased our enhanced aca application as part of the fixed bundled price charged per billing period while we generally do not track our revenues on an applicationbyapplication basis because applications are often sold in various groupings and configurations for a single price we estimate that if the aca is not modified or repealed revenues from our enhanced aca application and aca forms filings business will represent approximately 2 of total projected revenues for the year ending december 31 2022

for each of the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 our gross margin was approximately 85 although our gross margin may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonality and hiring trends we expect that our gross margin will remain relatively consistent in future periods

impact of the covid19 pandemic

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the covid19 outbreak to be a global pandemic in response federal state and local governments imposed various restrictions on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the disease and many such restrictions remain in place beginning in february 2020 we took various actions in order to minimize the risk of covid19 to our employees our clients and the communities in which we operate in march 2020 we began transitioning our employees to workfromhome arrangements during the fourth quarter of 2021 the majority of our employees returned to our offices our sales employees have been conducting meetings with current and prospective clients virtually since march 2020 but as prospective clients begin to take meetings inperson we expect our sales process to include a combination of virtual and inperson meetings we may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees and clients 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the operations of our clients and client prospects and may continue to do so for an indefinite period of time across many industries temporary and permanent business closures as well as business occupancy 

 

 

 

limitations resulted in significant layoffs and employee furloughs beginning in late march 2020 because we charge our clients on a peremployee basis for certain services we provide our recurring revenue has been negatively impacted by headcount reductions among our client base  

between august 2019 and march 2020 the federal open market committee reduced the target range for shortterm interest rates several times with the most significant rate cut occurring in march 2020 to support the economy and potentially reduce the impacts of the covid19 pandemic due to significantly lower average interest rates during 2021 as compared to 2020 interest earned on funds held for clients for the year ended december 31 2021 decreased from the year ended december 31 2020 which had a negative effect on recurring revenue growth 

demand for our solution remains high and despite the economic challenges brought on by the covid19 pandemic we remain confident in the overall health of our business the strength of our product offerings and our ability to continue to execute on our strategy prior to the covid19 pandemic our sales force frequently met with prospective clients inperson to sell our solution the remote work environment has presented an opportunity for our sales force in that each sales employee is able to meet virtually with a greater number of client prospects in a given day than he or she would if conducting only inperson meetings internally all applications within the paycom solution and more specifically employee selfservice manager onthego documents and checklists clue ask here and our enhanced learning management system were instrumental in our ability to seamlessly manage and communicate with our remote workforce as many clients transitioned their workforces to workfromhome arrangements we believe they too recognized the benefits of these applications and our focus on employee usage as well as the strengths and advantages of our single database solution in contrast we believe the remote work environment has exposed the weaknesses and disadvantages arising from the combination of disparate systems offered by some of our competitors we will continue to aggressively invest in sales and marketing and in research and development to drive future growth and expand our market share  

we are monitoring developments related to us federal state and local vaccination mandates and testing requirements and are evaluating the impact such mandates and requirements may have on our business and results of operations including any potential impact on our employees or the employees of our clients we are unable to estimate the full impact that the covid19 pandemic could have on our business and results of operations in the future due to numerous uncertainties including the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak the emergence of different covid19 variants actions that may be taken by governmental authorities the impact to the business of our clients and other factors identified in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k further while our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable the effect of the ongoing covid19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods 

 

key metrics

in addition to the us gaap and nongaap metrics discussed elsewhere in this form 10k we also monitor the following metrics to evaluate our business measure our performance and identify trends affecting our business 

 



 

 





 

 

 





components of results of operations

sources of revenues 

revenues are comprised of recurring revenues and implementation and other revenues we expect our revenues to increase as we introduce new applications expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients as a percentage of total revenues we expect our mix of recurring revenues and implementation and other revenues to remain relatively constant

recurring revenues 

recurring revenues include fees for our talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for form filings and delivery of client payroll checks and reports these revenues are derived from i fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed or ii fixed amounts charged per billing period we do not require clients to enter into longterm contractual commitments with us our billing period varies by client based on when each client pays its employees which may be weekly biweekly semimonthly or monthly because recurring revenues are based in part on fees for use of our applications and the delivery of checks and reports that are levied on a peremployee basis our recurring revenues increase as our clients hire more employees recurring revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered 

recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll tax filing forms such as form w2 and form 1099 and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs such as bonuses for our clients these payroll forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year and many of our clients are subject to aca form filing requirements in the first quarter which positively impacts first quarter revenues and margins we anticipate our revenues will continue to exhibit this seasonal pattern related to aca form filings for so long as the aca or replacement legislation includes employer reporting requirements in addition our recurring revenues during the fourth quarter are positively impacted by unscheduled payroll runs for our clients that occur before the end of the year nonetheless we expect the magnitude of these seasonal fluctuations in our revenues to decrease to the extent clients utilize more of our nonpayroll applications

recurring revenues also include interest earned on funds held for clients we collect funds from clients in advance of either the applicable due date for payroll tax submissions or the applicable disbursement date for employee payment services these collections from clients are typically disbursed from one to 30 days after receipt with some funds being held for up to 120 days we typically invest funds held for clients in money market funds demand deposit accounts commercial paper and certificates of deposit until they are paid to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees we expect interest earned on funds held for clients will increase as we introduce new applications expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients the amount of interest we earn from the investment of client funds is also impacted by changes in interest rates 

implementation and other revenues 

implementation and other revenues are comprised of implementation fees for the deployment of our solution and other revenues from sales of time clocks as part of our time and attendance services nonrefundable implementation fees are charged to new clients at inception and upon the addition of certain incremental applications for existing clients these fees generally range from 10 to 30 of the annualized value of the transaction implementation revenues are recognized as deferred revenue and amortized into income over the life of the client which is estimated to be ten years and other revenues are recognized upon shipment of time clocks implementation and other revenues comprised approximately 18 and 19 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

cost of revenues

cost of revenues consists of expenses related to hosting and supporting our applications hardware costs systems support and technology and depreciation and amortization these costs include employeerelated expenses including noncash stockbased compensation expenses and other expenses related to client support bank charges for processing ach transactions certain implementation expenses delivery charges and paper costs they also include our cost for time clocks sold and ongoing technology and support costs related to our systems the amount of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment allocated to cost of revenues is determined based upon an estimate of assets used to support our operations 

 

 

 

administrative expenses 

administrative expenses consist of sales and marketing research and development general and administrative and depreciation and amortization sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employeerelated expenses for our direct sales and marketing staff such as the amortization of commissions and bonuses and noncash stockbased compensation expenses marketing expenses and other related costs based on positive results from our advertising campaigns we plan to continue to invest in our marketing program and may adjust spending levels in future periods as we see opportunities for favorable returns on our investments research and development expenses consist primarily of employeerelated expenses including noncash stockbased compensation expenses for our development staff net of capitalized software costs for internally developed software we expect to grow our research and development efforts as we continue to broaden our payroll and hr solution offerings and extend our technological solutions by investing in the development of new applications and enhancements for existing applications general and administrative expenses consist of employeerelated expenses for finance and accounting legal human resources and management information systems personnel including noncash stockbased compensation expenses legal costs professional fees and other corporate expenses depreciation and amortization expenses consist of i the amount of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment allocated to administrative expenses based upon an estimate of assets used to support our selling general and administrative functions and ii amortization of intangible assets 

interest expense

interest expense includes interest on debt related to our corporate headquarters and settlements related to an interest rate swap we entered into in connection with such debt we capitalize interest incurred for indebtedness related to construction in progress

other income expense net

other income expense net includes interest earned on our own funds any gain or loss on the sale or disposal of fixed assets costs associated with the early repayment of debt and any unrealized gain or loss related to our interest rate swap 

provision for income taxes

our consolidated financial statements include a provision for income taxes incurred for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as for any operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we recognize a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 

 

 

 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of income data and such data as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods indicated as well as yearoveryear changes with respect to each line item refer to “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 filed with the sec on february 18 2021 for a discussion of results for the year ended december 31 2019 including a discussion of the changes in our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 



 

revenues

the increase in total revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 from the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily the result of the addition of new clients and productivity and efficiency gains in mature sales offices which are offices that have been open for at least 24 months and the sale of additional applications to our existing clients in addition our tax forms filing business in the first quarter of 2021 contributed to the increase in total revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the covid19 pandemic has resulted in and may continue to result in headcount fluctuations across our client base because we charge our clients on a peremployee basis for certain services we provide the drivers of revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 described above were impacted by the headcount fluctuations within our client base the negative effects on our client revenue of lower headcount resulting from the pandemic were more than offset by headcount additions from new clients added since the beginning of the pandemic and modestly improved headcount levels among our prepandemic client base beginning in the second quarter of 2021 significantly lower average interest rates during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 had a negative effect on recurring revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2021 we expect that the foregoing adverse macroeconomic factors may continue to have a negative effect on recurring revenues in future periods for so long as such conditions persist 

the increase in implementation and other revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 from the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily the result of the increased nonrefundable upfront conversion fees collected from the addition of new clients these fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the tenyear estimated life of our clients

expenses

cost of revenues

during the year ended december 31 2021 operating expenses increased from the prior year by 327 million due to a 238 million increase in employeerelated expenses primarily attributable to growth in the number of operating personnel a 56 million 

 

 

 

increase in shipping and supplies fees and a 32 million increase in automated clearing house fees in connection with the increase in revenues  d epreciation and amortization expense increased  5  6 million or 22  primarily due to the development of additional technology and purchases of other related fixed assets 

administrative expenses

sales and marketing

during the year ended december 31 2021 sales and marketing expenses increased from the prior year by 403 million due to a 341 million increase in employeerelated expenses including commissions and bonuses and a 62 million increase in marketing and advertising expense based on positive results from our advertising campaigns we plan to continue to invest in our marketing program and may adjust spending levels in future periods as we see opportunities for favorable returns on our investments

research and development

during the year ended december 31 2021 research and development expenses increased 282 million from the prior year primarily due to an increase in employeerelated expenses

as we continue the ongoing development of our platform and product offerings we generally expect research and development expenses exclusive of stockbased compensation to continue to increase particularly as we hire more personnel to support our growth while we expect this trend to continue on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of total revenues we also anticipate the rate of increase to decline over time as we leverage our growth and realize additional economies of scale as is customary for our business we also expect fluctuations in research and development expense as a percentage of revenue on a quartertoquarter basis due to seasonal revenue trends the introduction of new products the amount and timing of research and development costs that may be capitalized and the timing of onboarding new hires and restricted stock vesting events

expenditures for software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a threeyear period on a straightline basis the nature of the development projects underway during a particular period directly impacts the timing and extent of these capitalized expenditures and can affect the amount of research and development expenses in such period the table below sets forth the amounts of capitalized and expensed research and development costs for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020

 



 

general and administrative

during the year ended december 31 2021 general and administrative expenses increased by 316 million from the prior year due to a 368 million increase in employeerelated expenses including a 102 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense which increase was partially offset by a 52 million decrease in accounting and legal expenses

noncash stockbased compensation expense



 

 

 

 

 

during the year ended december 31 2021 our noncash stockbased compensation expense increased 74 million from the prior year due an increase in both the number of employees who received awards and the grant date fair value associated with issuances in 2021 the accelerated vesting of restricted stock subject to marketbased vesting conditions also contributed to the increase in our noncash stockbased compensation expense

depreciation and amortization

during the year ended december 31 2021 depreciation and amortization expense increased from the prior year primarily due to the development of additional technology and purchases of other related fixed assets

interest expense

the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2021 was due to the timing of the completion of our expanded operations facility in grapevine texas which resulted in a higher capitalization rate of interest in 2021 

other income expense net

the change in other income expense net for the year ended december 31 2021 was primarily due to the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swap as compared to the year ended december 31 2020

provision for income taxes

the provision for income taxes is based on a current estimate of the annual effective income tax rate adjusted to reflect the impact of discrete items our effective income tax rate was 23 for both the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

liquidity and capital resources

our principal sources of capital and liquidity are our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand deposit accounts money market funds and certificates of deposit additionally we maintain a senior secured revolving credit facility the “facility” which can be accessed as needed to supplement our operating cash flow and cash balances the facility provides us the ability to borrow funds in the aggregate principal amount of 750 million which may be increased to 1250 million subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying certain other conditions 

we have historically funded our operations from cash flows generated from operations cash from the sale of equity securities and debt financing although we have funded most of the costs for construction projects at our corporate headquarters and other facilities from available cash we have incurred indebtedness for a portion of these costs we anticipate funding our recently announced building expansion at our oklahoma city headquarters from available cash further all purchases under our stock repurchase plans were paid for from available cash we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to maintain operations make necessary capital expenditures and opportunistically repurchase shares for at least the next 12 months in addition based on our strong profitability and continued growth we expect to meet our longerterm liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and as needed financing arrangements

term credit agreement as of december 31 2021 our indebtedness consisted solely of term loans the “term loans” made under a senior secured term credit agreement as amended from time to time the “term credit agreement” among the company certain of our subsidiaries jpmorgan chase bank na bank of america na and kirkpatrick bank all term loans were used to finance construction projects at our corporate headquarters our obligations under the term loans are secured by a mortgage and first priority security interest in our corporate headquarters property the term loans mature on september 7 2025 and bear interest at our option at either a a prime rate plus 10 or b an adjusted libor rate for the interest period in effect for such term loan plus 15 

under the term credit agreement we are required to comply with certain financial and nonfinancial covenants including maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 125 to 10 and a funded indebtedness to ebitda ratio of not greater than 20 to 10 additionally the term credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including covenants limiting our ability to among other things grant liens incur debt effect certain mergers make investments dispose of assets enter into certain transactions including swap agreements and sale and leaseback transactions pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock and enter into transactions with affiliates in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit agreement of this size and type as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in the term credit agreement

interest rate swap agreement in connection with entering into the term credit agreement we also entered into a floatingtofixed interest rate swap agreement to limit the exposure to interest rate risk related to the term loans the “interest rate swap agreement” the interest rate swap agreement which has a maturity date of september 7 2025 provides that we receive quarterly variable interest payments based on the libor rate and pay interest at a fixed rate we have elected not to designate this interest rate swap as a hedge and as such changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized in our consolidated statements of 

 

 

 

income for the year ended december 31 20 2 1 we recorded a gain of  1  4 million  for the change in fair value of the interest rate swap and for the year ended december 31 20 20  we recorded a loss of  14 million  for the change in fair value of the interest rate swap  the change in fair value of the interest rate swap is included in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income 

revolving credit agreement on february 12 2018 we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement the “revolving credit agreement” with jpmorgan chase bank na and bank of america na that provided for the facility in the aggregate principal amount of 500 million the “revolving commitment” which could be increased to up to 1000 million subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying certain other conditions the facility includes a 50 million sublimit for swingline loans and a 25 million sublimit for letters of credit the facility was scheduled to mature on february 12 2020 on april 15 2019 we entered into the first amendment to revolving credit agreement the “first amendment” pursuant to the first amendment wells fargo bank na was added as a lender and the revolving commitment was increased to 750 million which may be further increased to 1250 million subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying other conditions the scheduled maturity date of the facility was also extended to april 15 2022 

borrowings under the facility will generally bear interest at a prime rate plus 10 or at our option an adjusted libor rate for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus 15 in each case subject to certain conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreement as of december 31 2021 we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the facility

stock repurchase plan and withholding shares to cover taxes in may 2016 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan allowing for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in open market transactions at prevailing market prices in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws including rule 10b51 programs since the initial authorization of the stock repurchase plan our board of directors has amended and extended and authorized new stock repurchase plans from time to time most recently in may 2021 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 3000 million of our common stock our stock repurchase plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time the actual timing number and value of shares repurchased depends on a number of factors including the market price of our common stock general market and economic conditions the shares withheld for taxes associated with the vesting of restricted stock and other corporate considerations 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we repurchased an aggregate of 163849 shares of common stock at an average cost of 40024 per share all of which were shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for certain employees upon the vesting of restricted stock our payment of the taxes on behalf of those employees resulted in an aggregate cash expenditure of 656 million and as such we generally subtract the amounts attributable to such withheld shares from the aggregate amount available for future purchases under our stock repurchase plan as of december 31 2021 there was 2663 million available for repurchases the stock repurchase plan will expire on may 13 2023 

cash flow analysis

our cash flows from operating activities have historically been significantly impacted by profitability implementation revenues received but deferred our investment in sales and marketing to drive growth and research and development our ability to meet future liquidity needs will be driven by our operating performance and the extent of continued investment in our operations failure to generate sufficient revenues and related cash flows could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our liquidity needs and achieve our business objectives

as our business grows we expect our capital expenditures and our investment activity to continue to increase during 2021 we completed the construction of our new texas operations facility in grapevine texas capital expenditures related to the construction of the facility began in the second quarter of 2019 on november 3 2021 we signed a construction contract for another building at our oklahoma city headquarters we estimate that the total cost of the project will be between 60 million and 70 million and we expect construction will take approximately two years to complete in addition we have purchased the naming rights to the downtown oklahoma city arena that is home to the oklahoma city thunder national basketball association franchise under the terms of the naming rights agreement we have committed to make payments escalating annually from 40 million in 2021 to 61 million in 2035 the payments are due in the fourth quarter of each year upon the conclusion of the initial term the agreement may be extended upon the mutual agreement of both parties for an additional fiveyear period depending on certain growth opportunities we may choose to accelerate investments in sales and marketing acquisitions technology and services actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our future revenues cash from operating activities and the level of expenditures in all areas of our business 

as part of our payroll and payroll tax filing services we collect funds from our clients for federal state and local employment taxes which we remit to the appropriate tax agencies we invest these funds in money market funds demand deposit accounts commercial paper and certificates of deposit from which we earn interest income during the period between their receipt and disbursement

 

 

 

our cash flows from investing and financing activities are influenced by the amount of funds held for clients which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter the balance of the funds we hold depends on our clients’ payroll calendars and therefore such balance changes from period to period in accordance with the timing of each payroll cycle 

our cash flows from financing activities are also affected by the extent to which we use available cash to purchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase plan as well as restricted stock vesting events that result in net share settlements and the company paying withholding taxes on behalf of certain employees

the following table summarizes the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020



operating activities

cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2021 primarily consisted of payments received from our clients and interest earned on funds held for clients cash used in operating activities primarily consisted of personnelrelated expenditures to support the growth and infrastructure of our business these payments included costs of operations advertising and other sales and marketing efforts it infrastructure development product research and development and security and administrative costs compared to the year ended december 31 2020 our operating cash flows for the year ended december 31 2021 were positively impacted by the growth of our business

investing activities

cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2021 increased from the prior year period due to a 661 million increase in purchases of shortterm investments from funds held for clients a 416 million decrease in proceeds from maturities of shortterm investments from funds held for clients a 266 million increase in cash used for purchases of property and equipment as well as a 55 million increase in purchases of intangible assets related to the naming rights agreement

financing activities

cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2021 increased from the prior year period primarily due to the impact of a 2824 million change related to the client funds obligation which is due to the timing of receipts from our clients and payments made to our clients’ employees and applicable taxing authorities on their behalf as well as a 520 million decrease in common stock repurchases the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities was slightly offset by a 28 million increase in withholding taxes paid related to net share settlements

contractual obligations

our principal commitments primarily consist of longterm debt and leases for office space as discussed within “note 4 goodwill and intangible assets net” we have entered into a naming rights agreement pursuant to which we have committed to pay an annual fee escalating annually from 40 million in 2021 to 61 million in 2035 in exchange for arena naming rights and other associated benefits  we disclose our longterm debt in “note 6 longterm debt net” and our commitments and contingencies in “note 12 commitments and contingencies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k in november 2021 we signed a construction contract for a new building at our oklahoma city headquarters we estimate that the total cost of the project will be between 60 million and 70 million and we expect construction will take approximately two years to complete

we plan to continue to lease additional office space to support our growth in addition many of our existing lease agreements provide us with the option to renew when applicable our future operating lease obligations include payments due during any renewal period provided for in the lease where the lease imposes a penalty for failure to renew additional details on our leases including the related future cash outflows are included within “note 5 leases” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this form 10k

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures estimates made in accordance with us gaap that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition are described below on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions to ensure that management believes them to be reasonable under the thencurrent facts and circumstances actual amounts and results may materially differ from these estimates made by management under different assumptions and conditions

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are described below accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations

revenue recognition

revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to for those goods or services substantially all of our revenues are comprised of revenue from contracts with clients sales and other applicable taxes are excluded from revenues

recurring revenues are derived primarily from our talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for form ﬁlings and delivery of client payroll checks and reports talent acquisition includes our applicant tracking candidate tracker enhanced background checks onboarding everify and tax credit services applications time and labor management includes time and attendance schedulingschedule exchange timeoff requests labor allocation labor management reportspush reporting geofencinggeotracking and microfence tools and applications payroll includes beti payroll and tax management paycom pay expense management mileage trackerfavr garnishment administration and gl concierge applications talent management includes our employee selfservice compensation budgeting performance management position management my analytics and paycom learning and content subscriptions applications hr management includes our manager onthego direct data exchange ask here documents and checklists government and compliance beneﬁts administrationbenefits to carrier benefit enrollment service cobra administration personnel action forms and performance discussion forms surveys enhanced aca and clue applications 

the performance obligations related to recurring revenues are satisfied during each client’s payroll period with the agreedupon fee being charged and collected as part of our processing of the client’s payroll recurring revenues are recognized at the conclusion of processing of each client’s payroll period when each respective payroll client is billed collectability is reasonably assured as the fees are collected through an automated clearing house as part of the client’s payroll cycle or through direct wire transfer which minimizes the default risk 

the contract period for substantially all contracts associated with these revenues is one month due to the fact that both we and the client have the unilateral right to terminate a wholly unperformed contract without compensating the other party by providing 30 days’ notice of termination our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications for clients who purchase multiple applications due to the shortterm nature of our contracts we do not believe it is meaningful to separately assess and identify whether or not each application potentially represents its own individual performance obligation as the revenue generated from each application is recognized within the same month as the revenue from the core payroll application similarly we do not believe it is meaningful to individually determine the standalone selling price for each application we consider the total price charged to a client in a given period to be indicative of the standalone selling price as the total amount charged is within a reasonable range of prices typically charged for our goods and services for comparable classes of client groups 

implementation and other revenues consist of nonrefundable upfront conversion fees which are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client setup as well as revenues from the sale of time clocks as part of our employee time and attendance services although these revenues are related to our recurring revenues they represent distinct performance obligations 

implementation activities primarily represent administrative activities that allow us to fulfill future performance obligations for our clients and do not represent services transferred to the client however the nonrefundable upfront fee charged to our clients results in an implied performance obligation in the form of a material right to the client related to the client’s option to renew at the end of each 30day contract period further given that all other services within the contract are sold at a total price indicative of the standalone selling price coupled with the fact that the upfront fees are consistent with upfront fees charged in similar contracts that we have with clients the standalone selling price of the client’s option to renew the contract approximates the dollar amount of the nonrefundable upfront fee the nonrefundable upfront fee is typically included on the client’s first invoice and is deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated renewal period ie tenyear estimated client life 

 

 

 

revenue s from the sale of time clocks are recognized when control is transferred to the client upon delivery of the product we estimate the standalone selling price for the time clocks by maximizing the use of observable inputs such as our specific pricing practices for time clocks 

goodwill and other intangible assets

goodwill is not amortized but we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually or earlier if at the reporting unit level an indicator of impairment arises our business is largely homogeneous and as a result goodwill is associated with one reporting unit we have selected june 30 as our annual goodwill impairment testing date a review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable the company performed a qualitative assessment to determine if it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of the reporting units had declined below its carrying value in the qualitative assessment we consider the macroeconomic conditions including any deterioration of general economic conditions industry and market conditions including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates changes in the productsservices and regulator and political developments cost of doing business overall financial performance other relevant reporting unit specific facts such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation based on our assessment there was no impairment recorded as of june 30 2021 for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 there were no indicators of impairment intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives

impairment of longlived assets

longlived assets including intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset we have determined that there is no impairment of longlived assets for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019

marketbased restricted stock awards and performancebased restricted stock units

we measure noncash stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock awards and units issued by using a monte carlo simulation model this model considers various subjective assumptions as inputs and represent our best estimates which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment as it relates to market volatilities the historical volatility of our stock price riskfree rates and expected life the valuation model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data determining these assumptions is subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our marketbased stock awards and performancebased restricted stock units and the associated compensation expense refer to note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stockbased compensation awards

recent accounting pronouncements   

refer to note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements

nongaap financial measures

management uses adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income as supplemental measures to review and assess the performance of our core business operations and for planning purposes we define i adjusted ebitda as net income plus interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization noncash stockbased compensation expense certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations if any and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap and ii nongaap net income as net income plus noncash stockbased compensation expense certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations if any and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap all of which are adjusted for the effect of income taxes adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income are metrics that provide investors with greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking we believe these metrics are useful to investors because they facilitate comparisons of our core business operations across periods on a consistent basis as well as comparisons with the results of peer companies many of which use similar nongaap financial measures to supplement results under us gaap in addition adjusted ebitda is a measure that provides useful information to management about the amount of cash available for reinvestment in our business repurchasing common stock and other purposes management believes that the nongaap measures presented in this form 10k when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with us gaap provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business and performance

 

 

 

 

adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income are not measures of financial performance under us gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income which we consider to be the most directly comparable us gaap measure adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing our operating performance you should not consider adjusted ebitda or nongaap net income in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other consolidated statements of income data prepared in accordance with us gaap adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do

the following tables reconcile net income to adjusted ebitda net income to nongaap net income and earnings per share to nongaap net income per share on a basic and diluted basis refer to “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 filed with the sec on february 18 2021 for a presentation of the 2019 amounts 

 



 



 

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate sensitivity

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 2780 million as of december 31 2021 these amounts are invested primarily in demand deposit accounts and money market funds we consider all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less and secregistered money market mutual funds to be cash equivalents the primary objectives of our investing activities are capital preservation meeting our liquidity needs and with respect to investing client funds generating interest income while maintaining the safety of principal we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes

our cash equivalents are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates the market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates

as described elsewhere in this form 10k the term loans made under the term credit agreement bear interest at our option at either a a prime rate plus 10 or b an adjusted libor rate for the interest period in effect for such term loan plus 15 as a result we are exposed to increased interest rate risk to mitigate the increased interest rate risk we entered into the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate swap agreement has effectively fixed our interest rate at 40 eliminating a portion of the variable rate and coinciding interest rate risk associated with the term loans as of december 31 2021 an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points would not have had a material effect on our operating results or financial condition

as described elsewhere in this form 10k the revolving credit agreement as amended provides for a facility in the aggregate amount of 750 million which may be increased to up to 1250 million borrowings under the facility will generally bear interest at a prime rate plus 10 or at our option an adjusted libor rate for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus 15 as of december 31 2021 we have not made any draws under the facility to the extent we make draws under the facility in the future we may be exposed to increased interest rate risk

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure we believe however that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error within a company if any have been detected

scalability to grow with our clients 

our solution is highly scalable we serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one employee to many thousands of employees while our target client size range is 50 to 5000 employees we calculate the number of clients’ employees based on parent company grouping our clients are able to use the same solution while their businesses grow by deploying applications asneeded in realtime pricing is determined based on employee headcount and the number of applications utilized enabling our clients to align hcm spending with their evolving hcm needs as compared to traditional hcm products that require clients to migrate to new software as they grow but retain fixed costs even if the client shrinks in size

efficient and productive research and development

we believe we benefit from a competitive advantage with our research and development investments people and processes early investments in our proprietary cloudbased architecture enable us to develop and deploy applications in a timely and costeffective manner we have also chosen to base our research and development team in oklahoma and texas which we believe provides us with highquality talent at a lower cost compared to other locations in the united states where there is more competition for technology talent these strategic decisions have enabled us to have a highly productive research and development function

our strategy for growth 

our strategy is to continue to establish our solution as the hcm industry standard by increasing our presence in existing markets and expanding into additional markets we intend to continue to increase our domestic sales capacity as well as potentially expand over the longer term into international markets we will also execute our strategy for growth by targeting larger clients expanding our inside sales organization and strengthening and extending our solution 

increase our presence in existing markets 

we believe a significant market opportunity exists to increase our presence within markets where we currently have a sales office each sales office is typically staffed with one sales team with each team comprised of a sales manager and approximately six to eight other sales professionals although we have a sales office in 38 of the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas “msas” in the united states based on july 2019 us census bureau estimates only five of these msas are currently served by multiple paycom sales teams we plan to further penetrate and more effectively capture existing markets by adding sales offices leveraging virtual sales meetings and increasing the number of sales teams in such markets

expand into additional markets

we plan to continue expanding our sales capability by opening sales offices and leveraging virtual sales meetings in certain metropolitan areas where we currently have no sales teams we have historically selected new locations based on potential client and employee demographics as well as business density when opening a new sales office we typically relocate a proven sales manager from an existing territory who then recruits a team of highperforming sales representatives it typically takes a new sales office 24 months to reach maturity 

enlarge our existing client relationships

we dedicate our resources to helping our clients facilitate their goals whether through helping our clients execute better hiring decisions manage compensation more effectively or simply operate more efficiently we believe a significant growth opportunity exists in selling additional applications to our current clients many clients have subsequently deployed additional applications as they recognize the benefits of our comprehensive solution as we extend and enhance the functionality of our solution we will continue to invest in initiatives to increase the adoption of our solution and maintain our high levels of client satisfaction

target larger clients and capture incremental small business demand

the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations and increased the number of applications we offer we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost to us to further capitalize on this opportunity we intend to continue targeting larger businesses opportunistically where our current sales model is effective 

we also receive inbound leads from businesses below our target client size range who can be onboarded through our inside sales organization we intend to continue to expand our inside sales capabilities to opportunistically capture inbound demand for our solution

maintain our leadership in innovation by strengthening and extending our solution

our ability to develop and deploy new applications and updates rapidly and costeffectively has been integral to the results that we have achieved to date we intend to continue extending the functionality and range of our solution in the future our development efforts are performed exclusively inhouse and are heavily based upon proactive research and client input we are focusing our 

 

 

 

investments on the development of new applications enhancements and learning courses that are responsive to the needs of our clients which are garnered through ongoing client interaction and collaboration 

our applications and tools

our hcm solution offers a full suite of applications and tools that generally fall within the following categories talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management

our clients

we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry we have approximately 31000 clients or approximately 16100 clients based on parent company grouping none of which constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 we stored data for over 50 million persons employed by our clients during the year ended december 31 2020

many small to midsized companies can typically make the decision to adopt our solution more quickly than larger companies which we believe results in a shorter sales cycle and more closely corresponds to our target sales cycle of 30 to 90 days as a result of the nature and size of our clientele we maintain a diversified client base and very low revenue concentration among our clients we believe however that larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients we serve and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost as we attract clients at the higher end of our target client size range we may face longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales 

 

 

 

competition 

the market for hcm solutions is rapidly evolving highly competitive and subject to changing technology shifting client needs and frequent introduction of new products and services our competitors range from small regional firms to large wellestablished international firms with multiple product offerings

we compete with firms that provide hcm solutions by various means many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software but as demand for greater flexibility and access to information grows we believe there will be increased competition in the delivery of hcm cloudbased solutions by other saas providers our competitors offer hcm solutions that may overlap with one several or all categories of applications and include companies such as automatic data processing inc ceridian hcm inc cornerstone ondemand inc intuit inc insperity inc oracle corporation paychex inc paylocity holding corporation paycor inc sap se servicenow inc ultimate kronos group workday inc and other local and regional providers 

competition in the hcm solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation breadth of service application offering and price the importance of these factors depends on the size of the business price tends to be the most important factor of competition for smaller businesses with fewer employees while the scope of features and customization is more important to larger businesses regardless of a company’s size another important factor is the implementation experience as all organizations are seeking a streamlined and simplified process 

sales and marketing

we generate client leads and demo requests accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs that target senior finance and hr executives technology professionals and senior business leaders of companies that perform hcm functions inhouse or outsource these functions to one of our competitors our marketing programs include







we sell our solution exclusively through our captive sales force substantially all of whom have a fouryear college degree we typically recruit sales candidates who have sales experience in nonhcm industries or with respect to candidates recruited directly from colleges and universities who have demonstrated an aptitude for sales our sales force is comprised of inside sales and field sales personnel who are organized geographically and client relations representatives “crrs” who sell additional applications to existing clients as of the filing of this form 10k we have 50 sales teams including one team consisting of crrs and inside sales representatives located in 27 states and plan to open additional sales offices to further expand our presence in the us market

when a new client processes payroll with us for an entire month our sales representative receives a onetime commission based upon an estimate of future annual revenues from such client executive sales representatives receive a higher commission rate and base salary based upon both current year and careertodate realized sales

in addition to managing client relationships our crrs are focused on expanding the number of applications our clients purchase from us by introducing them to additional applications when an existing client purchases and then utilizes a new application for one payroll cycle a crr receives a onetime commission based upon an estimate of future annual revenues from such client 

technology operations and security

technology

regulatory and certifications 

we are subject to varying degrees of regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide services local laws and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement differ significantly among those jurisdictions we are also subject to certain federal state and local regulations based on the products we offer for example as a result of our background screening application enhanced background checks we are subject to the fair credit reporting act and other federal and state background reporting laws further our status as a government contractor subjects us to federal government contracting regulations including the adherence to heightened equal employment opportunity requirements maintaining an affirmative action plan and other federal regulations 

data privacy has become a significant issue in the united states and in other countries the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future many federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations affecting or regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information in the united states these include for example rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca state breach notification laws and state privacy laws such as the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the “ccpa” the california privacy rights act the “cpra” and the illinois biometric information privacy act the “ibipa” further because some of our clients have establishments internationally the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” and other foreign data privacy laws may impact our processing of certain client and employee information

we voluntarily obtain thirdparty security examinations relating to our internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with system and organization controls report i “soc 1” our soc 1 examination is conducted every six months by one of the four largest independent international auditing firms and addresses among other areas our physical and environmental safeguards for production data centers data availability and integrity procedures change management procedures and logical security procedures we also obtain thirdparty examinations relating to our internal controls over security and privacy in accordance with system and organization controls report ii “soc 2” our soc 2 examination is conducted every year by one of the four largest independent international auditing firms and addresses among other areas internal controls around security availability processing integrity confidentiality and privacy

seasonality 

our revenues are seasonal in nature recurring revenues include revenues related to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs such as bonuses for our clients because payroll forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year and many of our clients are also subject to aca form filing requirements in the first quarter first quarter revenues and margins are generally higher than in subsequent quarters we anticipate that our revenues will continue to exhibit this seasonal pattern related to aca form filings for so long as the aca or replacement legislation includes employer reporting requirements in addition we often experience increased revenues during the fourth quarter due to unscheduled payroll runs for our clients that occur before the end of the year therefore we expect the seasonality of our revenue cycle to decrease to the extent clients utilize more of our nonpayroll applications

risk factors

tableend

the risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this form 10k including those risks identified in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” describe examples of risks uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statement if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect actual outcomes may vary materially from those included in this form 10k

risks related to our business

if our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to our clients’ or their employees’ sensitive data is otherwise obtained our solution may not be perceived as being secure clients may reduce the use of or stop using our solution our ability to attract new clients may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities

our solution involves the collection storage and transmission of clients’ and their employees’ confidential and proprietary information including personal identifying information as well as financial and payroll data hcm software is often targeted in cyberattacks including computer viruses worms phishing attacks malicious software programs and other information security breaches which could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our clients’ sensitive data or otherwise disrupt our clients’ or other third parties’ business operations if cybercriminals are able to circumvent our security measures or if we are unable to detect an intrusion into our systems and contain such intrusion in a reasonable amount of time our clients’ sensitive data may be compromised

certain of our employees have access to sensitive information about our clients’ employees while we conduct background checks of our employees and limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls resulting in a security breach 

although we have security measures in place to protect client information and prevent data loss and other security breaches these measures could be breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error thirdparty or employee malfeasance or otherwise because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently we may not be able to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative or protective measures while we currently maintain a cyber liability insurance policy cyber liability insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our cyber liability insurance policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention from our business and operations

any actual or perceived breach of our security could damage our reputation cause existing clients to discontinue the use of our solution prevent us from attracting new clients or subject us to thirdparty lawsuits regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

any damage failure or disruption of our saas network infrastructure or data centers could impair our ability to effectively provide our solution harm our reputation and adversely affect our business

our saas network infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations our clients access our solution through standard web browsers smart phones tablets and other webenabled devices and depend on us for fast and reliable access to our solution we serve all of our clients from our three fully redundant data centers located in oklahoma and texas our saas network infrastructure and data centers are vulnerable to damage failure and disruption 

in the future we may experience issues with our computing and communications infrastructure or data centers caused by the following factors



 

 

 















if our saas network infrastructure or our clients’ ability to access our solution is interrupted client and employee data from recent transactions may be permanently lost and we could be exposed to significant claims by clients particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds payable to employees or tax authorities further any adverse changes in service levels at our data centers resulting from damage to or failure of our data centers could result in disruptions in our services any significant instances of system downtime or performance problems at our data centers could negatively affect our reputation and ability to attract new clients prevent us from gaining new or additional business from our current clients or cause our current clients to terminate their use of our solution any of which would adversely impact our revenues in addition if our network infrastructure and data centers fail to support increased capacity due to growth in our business our clients may experience interruptions in the availability of our solution such interruptions may reduce our revenues cause us to issue refunds to clients or adversely affect our retention of existing clients any of which could have a negative impact on our business operating results or financial condition

if we are not able to develop enhancements and new applications keep pace with technological developments or respond to future disruptive technologies we might not remain competitive and our business could be adversely affected

our continued success will depend on our ability to adapt and innovate in order to attract new clients and increase revenues from existing clients we need to enhance add new features to and improve our existing applications and introduce new applications the success of any enhancements or new features and applications depends on several factors including timely completion and introduction and market acceptance we may expend significant time and resources developing and pursuing sales of a particular enhancement or application that may not result in revenues in the anticipated time frame or at all or may not result in revenue growth sufficient to offset increased expenses further changing legal and regulatory requirements may delay the development or introduction of enhancements or new applications or render certain of our applications obsolete if we are unable to successfully develop enhancements new features or new applications to meet client needs our business and operating results could be adversely affected

in addition because our applications are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using internet tools and protocols we must continuously modify and enhance our applications to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies if we are unable to respond in a timely and costeffective manner to these rapid technological developments our current and future applications may become less marketable and less competitive or even obsolete

our success is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver hcm solutions at lower prices more efficiently or more conveniently such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete

the market in which we participate is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected

the market for hcm software is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented we expect competition to intensify in the future with the introduction of new technologies and new market entrants many of our current and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition longer operating histories more established relationships in the industry and significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as a result some of these competitors may be able to







 

 

 











some of our principal competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures similarly some competitors offer different billing terms which has resulted in pressures on our billing terms if we are unable to maintain our pricing levels and our billing terms our operating results would be negatively impacted in addition pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales reduced margins losses or the failure of our solution to maintain widespread market acceptance any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

we compete with firms that provide hcm solutions by various means many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software but as demand for greater flexibility and access to information grows we believe there will be increased competition in the delivery of hcm cloudbased solutions by other saas providers our competitors offer hcm solutions that may overlap with one several or all categories of applications and include companies such as automatic data processing inc ceridian hcm inc cornerstone ondemand inc intuit inc insperity inc oracle corporation paychex inc paylocity holding corporation paycor inc sap se servicenow inc ultimate kronos group workday inc and other local and regional providers 

competition in the hcm solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness application quality and reputation breadth of service and product offering and price many of our competitors have established marketing relationships access to larger client bases and major distribution agreements with consultants software vendors and distributors in addition some competitors may offer software that addresses one or a limited number of hcm functions at a lower price point or with greater depth than our solution further some potential clients particularly large enterprises may elect to develop their own internal solutions if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected

our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our deployment or technical support services or if our solution fails to perform properly

our business depends on our ability to satisfy our clients both with respect to our applications and the technical support provided to help our clients use the applications that address the needs of their businesses we use our inhouse deployment personnel to implement and configure our solution and provide support to our clients if a client is not satisfied with the quality of our solution the applications delivered or the support provided we could incur additional costs to address the situation our profitability might be negatively affected and the client’s dissatisfaction with our deployment or support service could harm our ability to sell additional applications to that client in addition our sales process is highly dependent on the reputation of our solution and applications and on positive recommendations from our existing clients our clients have no obligation to continue to use our applications and may choose not to continue to use our applications at the same or higher level of service if at all moreover our clients generally have the right to cancel their agreements with us for any or no reason by providing 30 days’ prior written notice in the past some of our clients have elected not to continue to use our applications any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality technical support could adversely affect client retention our reputation our ability to sell our applications to existing and prospective clients and as a result our business operating results or financial condition 

further our solution is inherently complex and may in the future contain or develop undetected defects or errors any defects in our applications could adversely affect our reputation impair our ability to sell our applications in the future and result in significant costs to us the costs incurred in correcting any application defects may be substantial and could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition any defects in functionality or defects that cause interruptions in the availability of our applications could result in 











 

 

 





because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our applications could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our clients regard as significant our clients might assert claims against us in the future alleging that they suffered damages due to a defect error or other failure of our solution our errors and omissions insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention any failures in the performance of our solution could harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients which would have an adverse impact on our business operating results or financial condition

the market for our solution among large companies may be limited if these companies demand customized features and functions that we do not offer

prospective clients especially larger companies may require customized features and functions unique to their business processes that we do not offer in order to ensure we meet these requirements we may devote a significant amount of support and service resources to larger prospective clients increasing the cost and time required to complete sales with no guarantee that these prospective clients will adopt our solution further we may not be successful in implementing any customized features or functions if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we do not offer or that would be difficult for them to deploy themselves the market for our solution will be more limited and our business could be adversely affected

we are dependent on the continued service of our key executives and if we fail to retain such key executives our business could be adversely affected

we believe that our success depends in part on the continued services of our senior management team consisting of chad richison craig e boelte jeffrey d york jon evans and bradley s smith our business could be adversely affected if we fail to retain these key executives although the employment arrangements of certain of our key executives contain noncompetition restrictions our business could nonetheless be adversely affected if a key executive leaves paycom and attempts to compete with us in addition we have not purchased key person life insurance on any members of our senior management team 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel including software developers and skilled it sales marketing and operational personnel our ability to develop and market new and existing products and in turn increase our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected

our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new applications as a result we are heavily dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified software developers and it personnel with the requisite education background and industry experience in addition to continue to execute our growth strategy we must also attract and retain qualified sales marketing and operational personnel capable of supporting a larger and more diverse client base the software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors this competition for qualified personnel may be amplified by new immigration laws or policies that could limit software companies’ ability to recruit internationally although such changes in immigration laws or policies would not have a significant direct impact on our workforce the ensuing increase in demand for software developers and it personnel could impair our ability to attract or retain skilled employees andor significantly increase our costs to do so furthermore identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use of our applications requires significant time expense and attention and it can take a substantial amount of time before our employees are fully trained and productive the loss of the services of a significant number of employees could be disruptive to our development efforts which may adversely affect our business by causing us to lose clients increase operating expenses or divert management’s attention to recruit replacements for the departed employees

 

 

 

the failure to develop and maintain our brand costeffectively could have an adverse effect on our business 

we believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a costeffective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our solution and is an important element in attracting new clients and retaining existing clients successful promotion of our brand depends largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful applications at competitive prices brand promotion activities including increased spending on our national media campaigns may not yield increased revenues and even if they do any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brand if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand we may fail to attract enough new clients or retain our existing clients to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding efforts which could have an adverse effect on our business

if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights our competitive advantage could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets generate reduced revenues or incur costly litigation to protect our rights

our success is dependent in part upon our intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and to protect our intellectual property rights in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions however the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our applications and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products or services that compete with ours

we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property we have been involved in litigation in the past and litigation may be necessary in the future to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets such litigation could be costly timeconsuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights we may not be able to secure protect and enforce our intellectual property rights or control access to and the distribution of our solution and proprietary information which could adversely affect our business

we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights

considerable intellectual property development activity exists in our industry and we expect that software developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of applications and competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps our competitors as well as a number of other entities and individuals may own or claim to own intellectual property in technology areas relating to our solution or applications in addition we may increasingly be subject to trademark infringement claims as our presence grows in the marketplace from time to time third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights a claim of infringement may also be made relating to technology that we acquire or license from third parties however we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover or may be alleged to cover some or all of our solution applications or brands

the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable and as a result any future litigation or claim of infringement could i cause us to enter into an unfavorable royalty or license agreement pay ongoing royalties or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms ii require us to discontinue the sale of our solution or applications iii require us to indemnify our clients or thirdparty service providers or iv require us to expend additional development resources to redesign our solution or applications any of these outcomes could harm our business even if we were to prevail any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business and operations

the use of open source software in our applications may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property rights

some of our applications use software covered by open source licenses from time to time there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate such software into their products or applications as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software litigation could be costly for us to defend have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional development resources to change our applications in addition if we were to combine our applications with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain of the open source licenses be required to release the source code of our applications if we inappropriately use open source software we may be required to redesign our applications discontinue the sale of our applications or take other remedial actions which could adversely impact our business operating results or financial condition

 

 

 

we employ thirdparty licensed software for use in our applications and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs or reduced service levels which could adversely affect our business 

our applications incorporate certain thirdparty software obtained under licenses from other companies we anticipate that we will continue to rely on such thirdparty software and development tools from third parties in the future although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the thirdparty software we currently license this may not always be the case or it may be difficult or costly to replace in addition incorporating the software used in our applications with new thirdparty software may require significant work and substantial investment of our time and resources also to the extent that our applications depend upon the successful operation of thirdparty software in conjunction with our software any undetected errors or defects in this thirdparty software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our applications delay new application introductions result in a failure of our applications and harm our reputation

we may acquire other businesses applications or technologies which could divert our management’s attention result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results

in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses applications or technologies that we believe complement or expand our applications enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities the pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur expenses in identifying investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions whether or not they are ultimately consummated

we do not have any experience in acquiring other businesses if we acquire additional businesses we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel operations and technologies successfully or to effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition we also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors including























in addition a significant portion of the purchase price of any companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets which must be assessed for impairment at least annually in the future if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process which could harm our results of operations acquisitions could also result in issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt which would result in dilution to our stockholders

our business depends in part on the success of our relationships with third parties

we rely on thirdparty couriers financial and accounting processing systems and various financial institutions to deliver payroll checks and tax forms perform financial services in connection with our applications such as providing automated clearing house “ach” and wire transfers as part of our payroll and tax payment services and to provide technology and content support manufacture time clocks and process background checks we anticipate that we will continue to depend on various thirdparty relationships in order to grow our business provide technology and content support manufacture time clocks process background checks and deliver payroll checks and tax forms identifying negotiating and documenting relationships with these third parties and integrating thirdparty content and technology requires significant time and resources our agreements with third parties typically are nonexclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors in addition these third parties may not perform as expected under our agreements and we may have disagreements or disputes with such third parties which could negatively affect our 

 

 

 

brand and reputation a global economic slowdown could also adversely affect the businesses of our thirdparty providers hindering their ability to provide the services on which we rely further a disruption of the federal reserve bank’s services including ach processing could negatively affect our payroll and expense reimbursement services by delaying direct deposits and other financial transactions across the united states if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected even if we are successful these relationships may not result in improved operating results 

because our longterm success may depend in part on our ability to expand the sales of our solution to clients located outside of the united states our business could be subject to risks associated with international operations

an element of our growth strategy is to expand our operations and client base to date we have not engaged in any operations outside of the united states if we decide to expand our operations into international markets it will require significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory economic and political risks that are different from those in the united states because of our lack of experience with international operations we cannot ensure that our international expansion efforts will be successful and the impact of such expansion efforts may adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

legal and regulatory risks

changes in laws government regulations and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

many of our applications are designed to assist our clients in complying with government regulations that continually change the introduction of new regulatory requirements or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations could increase our cost of doing business for example there have been and may continue to be a significant number of new laws and regulations promulgated by federal state and local governments following the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic we have expended additional resources and incurred additional costs in addressing the regulatory requirements applicable to us and our clients more generally changing regulatory requirements may make the introduction of new applications and enhancements more costly or more timeconsuming than we currently anticipate or could prevent the introduction of new applications and enhancements by us altogether changes in laws regulations or policies could also affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for certain of our existing applications or services which would result in decreased revenues further we may spend time and money developing new applications and enhancements that due to regulatory changes become unnecessary prior to being released in addition any failure to educate and assist our clients with respect to new or revised legislation that impacts them could have an adverse effect on our reputation and any failure to modify our applications or develop new applications in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations additionally new regulations or changes to existing regulations could be unclear difficult to interpret or conflict with other applicable regulations our or our clients’ failure to comply with new or modified laws or regulations could result in financial penalties legal proceedings or reputational harm finally a negative audit or other investigations by the us government could adversely affect our ability to receive us government contracts and our future operating performance and could result in financial or reputational harm 

in addition federal state and foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet as a commercial medium changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our applications further government agencies or private organizations may impose taxes fees or other charges for accessing the internet or commerce conducted via the internet these laws or charges could limit the growth of internetrelated commerce or communications generally or could result in reductions in the demand for internetbased applications such as ours

privacy concerns and laws or other regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our applications 

our applications are subject to various complex laws and regulations on the federal state and local levels including those governing data security and privacy which have become significant issues globally the regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future many federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information in the united states these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca federal and state labor and employment laws and state data breach notification laws and state privacy laws such as the new york stop hacks and improve electronic data security shield act the ibipa the ccpa and the cpra which expands upon the ccpa and was passed in the recent california election in november 2020 the ibipa includes a private right of action for persons who are aggrieved by violations of the ibipa the ccpa provides consumers with a private right of action if covered companies suffer a data breach related to their failure to implement reasonable security measures the ccpa and cpra give california consumers certain rights to be informed of and delete the personal information that we hold similar to those provided by the european union’s gdpr our customers and other users may seek assurances of compliance with ccpa crpa gdpr and other privacy 

 

 

 

laws from us as a service provider and data processor on their behalf  further because some of our clients have establishments in ternationally  the gdpr and other foreign data privacy laws may impact our processing of certain client and employee information failure to comply with data protection and privacy laws and regulations could result in regulatory scrutiny and increased exposure to the risk of litigation or the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition moreover allegations of noncompliance whether or not true could be costly time consuming distracting to management and cause reputational harm  

in addition there are a number of other legislative proposals worldwide including in the united states at both the federal and state level that could impose additional and potentially conflicting obligations in areas affecting our business newlypassed legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the ability of our clients to process handle store use and transmit demographic and personal information from their employees which could reduce demand for our solution 

in addition to government regulation privacy advocates and industry groups may propose and adopt new and different selfregulatory standards because the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws are still uncertain it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our solution any failure to comply with government regulations that apply to our applications including privacy and data protection laws could subject us to liability in addition to the possibility of fines lawsuits and other claims we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our solution which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition any inability to adequately address privacy concerns and claims even if unfounded or inability to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws regulations and policies could result in additional cost and liability to us damage to our reputation reductions in our sales and other adverse effects on our business operating results or financial condition

furthermore privacy concerns may cause our clients’ employees to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our clients and their employees to use our applications effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our applications in certain industries 

the adoption of new or adverse interpretations of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes could subject us to additional regulation and related expenses and require changes to our business

the adoption of new money transmitter or money services business statutes in jurisdictions changes in regulators’ interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes or regulations or disagreements by regulatory authorities with our interpretation of such statutes or regulations could subject us to registration or licensing or limit business activities until we are appropriately licensed these occurrences could also require changes to the manner in which we conduct certain aspects of our business or invest client funds which could adversely impact the amount of interest income we receive from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities and accounts designated by our clients

while we maintain that we are not a money services business or money transmitter we have adopted an antimoney laundering “aml” compliance program to mitigate the risk of our application being used for illegal or illicit activity and to help detect and prevent fraud our aml compliance program is designed to foster trust in our application and services 

we are registered as a “money services business” in one jurisdiction and intend to apply for licenses in others should other state or federal regulators make a determination that we have operated as an unlicensed money services business or money transmitter we could be subject to civil and criminal fines penalties costs of registration legal fees reputational damage or other negative consequences all of which may have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition

 

 

 

our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth and organizational change if we fail to manage such growth and change effectively we may be unable to execute our business plan maintain high levels of service or adequately address competitive challenges 

we have experienced and may continue to experience rapid growth in our headcount and operations which has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management operational and financial resources we have also experienced significant growth in the number of clients and transactions and the amount of client and employee data that our infrastructure supports as a result our organizational structure and recording systems and procedures are becoming more complex as we improve our operational financial and management controls our success depends in part on our ability to manage this growth and organizational change effectively to manage the expected growth of our headcount and operations we must continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures the failure to effectively manage growth could result in declines in the quality of or client satisfaction with our applications increases in costs difficulties or delays in introducing new applications or other operational difficulties any of which could adversely affect our business by impairing our ability to retain and attract clients or sell additional applications to our existing clients 

further we need to continue to expand our inside and outside sales force and support team members in order to grow our client base and increase our revenues our ability to add additional offices may be constrained by the covid19 pandemic the willingness and availability of qualified personnel to staff and manage any new offices and our success in recruiting and training sales personnel in those new offices if our expansion efforts are unsuccessful our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 

adverse tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our clients which could increase the costs of our solution and applications and could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

as a vendor of services we are ordinarily held responsible by taxing authorities for collecting and paying any applicable sales or other similar taxes additionally the application of federal state and local tax laws to services provided electronically like ours is evolving new income sales use or other tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time possibly with retroactive effect and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services and applications provided over the internet these enactments could adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and ultimately could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that change over time we review these rules and regulations periodically and when we believe we are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state we may voluntarily engage state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with that state’s rules and regulations we cannot ensure that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we currently believe no such taxes are required 

in addition existing tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be interpreted changed modified or applied adversely to us possibly with retroactive effect which could require us or our clients to pay additional tax amounts as well as require us or our clients to pay fines or penalties and substantial interest for past amounts if we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our clients we could be held liable for such costs thereby adversely affecting our business operating results or financial condition additionally the imposition of such taxes on us would effectively increase the cost of our software and services we provide to clients and would likely have a negative impact on our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the jurisdictions in which such taxes are imposed

the modification or repeal of certain provisions of the aca could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we generate acarelated revenues i on an annual basis in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients and ii from clients who have purchased our enhanced aca application as part of the fixed bundled price charged per billing period the modification or repeal of certain provisions of the aca could harm our business operating results and financial condition if the aca is modified to eliminate the employer reporting requirements or if the aca is repealed and replaced with new legislation that does not include similar employer reporting requirements we will no longer generate revenues in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients while we generally do not track our revenues on an applicationbyapplication basis because applications are often sold in various groupings and configurations for a single price we estimate that if the aca is not modified or repealed revenues from our enhanced aca application and aca forms filings business will represent approximately 3 of total projected revenues for the year ending december 31 2021 further uncertainty regarding the potential future modification repeal or replacement of the aca could adversely affect our ability to sell our enhanced aca application to new clients

 

 

 

industry and financial risks 

our financial results may fluctuate due to many factors some of which may be beyond our control

our results of operations including our revenues costs of revenues administrative expenses operating income cash flow and deferred revenue may vary significantly in the future and the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance fluctuations in our financial results may negatively impact the value of our common stock our financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control and as a result may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate from period to period include without limitation  





































certain of our operating results and financial metrics may be difficult to predict as a result of seasonality

we have historically experienced seasonality in our revenues because a significant portion of our recurring revenues relate to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 and the annual processing and filing of acarelated forms because these forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year first quarter revenues are generally higher than revenues in subsequent quarters in addition unscheduled payroll runs at the end of the year such as bonuses often result in increased revenues in the fourth quarter we expect this seasonality to continue in the future although the repeal or modification of the aca could have an impact on the seasonality of our revenues seasonal fluctuations in certain of our operating results and financial metrics may make such results and metrics difficult to predict

 

 

 

our outstanding indebtedness is subject to certain operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities and may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business 

we have incurred indebtedness to fund certain construction projects at our corporate headquarters pursuant to the terms of our outstanding indebtedness we may not subject to certain exceptions



















in addition we are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” to fixed charges defined as current maturities of longterm debt interest expense rent expense and distributions of not less than 125 to 10 and a funded indebtedness defined as total indebtedness less accounts payable accrued expenses and deferred revenues to ebitda of not greater than 20 to 10 the operating and financial covenants in the loan agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into may restrict our ability to finance our operations engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies we may also be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on our debt which would reduce the amount of money available for operations working capital expansion or other general corporate purposes

our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations and comply with the operating and financial covenants may be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to control many of these factors and comply with these covenants a breach of any of the covenants under our loan agreements could result in an event of default which could cause all of our outstanding indebtedness to become immediately due and payable

if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings

we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as of december 31 2020 we had recorded a total of 519 million of goodwill and 03 million of other intangible assets an adverse change in domestic or global market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of our critical assumptions or estimates made in connection with the impairment testing of goodwill or intangible assets could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge to our goodwill or other intangible assets any such material charges may have a negative impact on our operating results or financial condition

we may pay employees and taxing authorities amounts due for a payroll period before a client’s electronic funds transfers are finally settled to our account if client payments are rejected by banking institutions or otherwise fail to clear into our accounts we may require additional sources of shortterm liquidity and our operating results could be adversely affected

our payroll processing application moves significant funds from the account of a client to employees and relevant taxing authorities for larger funding amounts we require clients to transfer the funds to us via fed wire for smaller funding amounts we debit a client’s account prior to any disbursement on its behalf and due to ach banking regulations funds previously credited could be reversed under certain circumstances and time frames after our payment of amounts due to employees and taxing and other regulatory authorities there is therefore a risk that the employer’s funds will be insufficient to cover the amounts we have already paid on its behalf while such shortage and accompanying financial exposure has only occurred in very limited circumstances in the past should clients default on their payment obligations in the future we might be required to advance substantial funds to cover such obligations in such an event we may be required to seek additional sources of shortterm liquidity which may not be available on reasonable terms if at all and our operating results and our liquidity could be adversely affected and our banking relationships could be harmed

 

 

 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected 

as a public company we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements management must evaluate and furnish a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and our auditors must attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting

if we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports andor we could become subject to investigations by the new york stock exchange the “nyse” the sec or other regulatory authorities and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected

our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance

we have released and may continue to release guidance in our earnings conference calls earnings releases or otherwise regarding our future performance which represents our estimates as of the date of release this guidance which includes forwardlooking statements has been and will be based on projections prepared by our management these projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections accordingly no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections

projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that while presented with numerical specificity are inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control projections are also based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions some of which will change the principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any third parties

guidance is necessarily speculative in nature and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will vary significantly from actual results accordingly our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material in light of the foregoing investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock

any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this “risk factors” section in this form 10k could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance and the differences may be adverse and material

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

generally accepted accounting principles in the united states are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change

risks related to ownership of our securities

the issuance of additional stock in connection with acquisitions our stock incentive plans warrants or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to one hundred million shares of common stock and up to ten million shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations we may issue all of these shares that are not already outstanding without any action or approval by our stockholders we intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions in the future we may pay for such acquisitions in part or in full through the issuance of additional equity securities

any issuance of shares in connection with an acquisition the exercise of stock options or warrants the award of shares of restricted stock or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by our existing stockholders

 

 

 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company 

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management

any provision of our certificate of incorporation bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

our certificate of incorporation contains an exclusive forum provision that may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers

our certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if no court of chancery located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or other employees to us or our stockholders any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of delaware law or our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws as either may be amended from time to time or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in addition this exclusive forum selection provision will not apply to claims under the exchange act moreover section 22 of the securities act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the securities act or the rules and regulations thereunder accordingly there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce our forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the securities act this forum selection provision may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us it is also possible that notwithstanding the forum selection clause included in our certificate of incorporation a court could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable

general risks

the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity

the global spread of the novel coronavirus covid19 has created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption individually and collectively the consequences of the covid19 pandemic could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity the extent to which the covid19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to



 



 



our clients are sensitive to negative changes in economic conditions across many industries temporary and permanent business closures as well as business occupancy limitations have resulted in significant layoffs and employee furloughs since late march 2020 because we charge our clients on a peremployee basis for certain services we provide decreases in headcount at our clients negatively impact our results of operations further at the onset of the covid19 pandemic a limited number of new clients 

 

 

 

temporarily delayed service implementation as the covid19 pandemic continues to create uncertainty and the potential for ongoing business disruptions we may experience similar clientdriven delays in service implementation in the future 

in order to spur economic activity to counteract the adverse effects of the covid19 pandemic the federal open market committee lowered its target for the federal funds rate in march 2020 in addition a provision in the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” allows employers to delay the payment of the employer’s share of social security taxes to a future date to the extent our clients make such election we are collecting less money from them to hold and then remit to the appropriate taxing authorities which adversely affects our average funds held for clients balance and consequently interest earned on funds held for clients significantly lower average interest rates in 2020 combined with the lack of growth of the average funds held for clients balance due to lower employee headcount at our clients as well as clients electing the social security tax deferral under the cares act had a negative effect on interest earned on funds held for clients and consequently recurring revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2020 we expect that the foregoing adverse economic factors will continue to have a negative impact on recurring revenues in future periods for so long as such conditions persist further the impact of the pandemic on our recurring revenues combined with our deliberate increased level of investment to drive the growth of our business may negatively affect net income

beginning in february 2020 we took various actions in order to minimize the risk of covid19 to our employees our clients and the communities in which we operate as of december 31 2020 96 of our employees were working remotely our remote work arrangements may create increased operational risk including data security risk as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruptions in typical operations

we have prohibited all businessrelated travel until further notice and our sales force is conducting all sales meetings virtually if clients and client prospects are not as willing or available to engage via video conference and teleconference the shift from inperson to virtual sales meetings could negatively affect our sales efforts impede client acquisition and lengthen our sales cycles which would negatively impact our business and results of operations and could impact our financial condition in the future

even after the covid19 outbreak has subsided depending upon its duration and frequency of recurrence and the governmental policies in response thereto we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact including any recession that may occur or be continuing as a result we continue to monitor and evaluate the extent to which covid19 has impacted us and our employees and clients and the extent to which it and other emerging developments are expected to impact us in the future 

adverse economic and market conditions could affect our business operating results or financial condition

our business depends on the overall demand for hcm applications and on the economic health of our current and prospective clients if economic conditions in the united states or in global markets deteriorate clients may cease their operations eliminate or reduce unscheduled payroll runs such as bonuses reduce headcount delay or reduce their spending on hcm and other outsourcing services or attempt to renegotiate their contracts with us an economic decline could result in reductions in sales of our applications decreased revenue from unscheduled payroll runs and fees charged on a peremployee basis longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition in addition hcm spending levels may not increase following any recovery

in recent years there have been several instances when there has been uncertainty regarding the ability of congress and the president collectively to reach agreement on federal budgetary and spending matters a period of failure to reach agreement on these matters particularly if accompanied by an actual or threatened government shutdown may have an adverse impact on the us economy additionally because certain of our clients rely on government resources to fund their operations a prolonged government shutdown may affect such clients’ ability to make timely payments to us which could adversely affect our operations results or financial condition 

further as part of our payroll and tax filing application we collect and then remit client funds to taxing authorities and accounts designated by our clients during the interval between receipt and disbursement we may invest such funds in money market funds demand deposit accounts certificates of deposit and commercial paper these investments are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks and such risks may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility any loss of or inability to access such funds could have an adverse impact on our cash position and results of operations and could require us to obtain additional sources of liquidity which may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us if at all

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this “form 10k” the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” for a discussion of the uncertainties risks and assumptions associated with those statements actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in the section entitled “risk factors” unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires the terms “we” “us” “our” and the “company” refer to paycom software inc and its consolidated subsidiaries all amounts presented in tables other than per share amounts are in thousands unless otherwise noted

overview 

we are a leading provider of a comprehensive cloudbased human capital management “hcm” solution delivered as softwareasaservice we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment lifecycle from recruitment to retirement our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions including talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and human resources management applications our userfriendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees enabling selfmanagement of their hcm activities in the cloud which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity

we generate revenues from i fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed and ii fixed amounts charged per billing period we do not require clients to enter into longterm contractual commitments with us our billing period varies by client based on when each client pays its employees which may be weekly biweekly semimonthly or monthly we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry none of our clients constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 our revenues are primarily generated through our sales force that solicits new clients and our client relations representatives who sell new applications to existing clients

our continued growth depends on attracting new clients through further penetration of our existing markets and geographic expansion into new markets targeting a high degree of client employee usage across our solution and introducing new applications to our existing client base we believe our ability to continue to develop new applications and to improve existing applications will enable us to increase revenues in the future and the number of our new applications adopted by our clients has been a significant factor in our revenue growth we also plan to open additional sales offices in the future and leverage virtual sales meetings to further expand our presence in the us market

our principal marketing efforts include national and local advertising campaigns email campaigns social and digital media campaigns search engine marketing methods tradeshows print advertising and outbound marketing including personalized direct mail campaigns in addition we generate leads and build recognition of our brand and thought leadership with relevant and informative content such as white papers blogs podcast episodes and webinars

throughout our history we have built strong relationships with our clients as the hcm needs of our clients evolve we believe that we are wellpositioned to expand the hcm spending of our clients and we believe this opportunity is significant to be successful we must continue to demonstrate the operational and economic benefits of our solution as well as effectively hire train motivate and retain qualified personnel

 

 

 

growth outlook opportunities and challenges 

as a result of our significant revenue growth and geographic expansion we are presented with a variety of opportunities and challenges our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications consequently we have historically generated the majority of our revenues from our payroll applications although our revenue mix has evolved and will continue to evolve as we develop and add new nonpayroll applications to our solution we believe our strategy of focusing on increased employee usage is key to longterm client satisfaction and client retention client adoption of new applications and client employee usage of both new and existing applications have been significant factors in our revenue growth and we expect the continuation of this trajectory will depend in part on the introduction of applications to our existing client base that encourage and promote more employee usage moreover in order to increase revenues and continue to improve our operating results we must also attract new clients we intend to obtain new clients by i continuing to leverage our sales force productivity within markets where we currently have existing sales offices ii expanding our presence in metropolitan areas where we currently have an existing sales office through adding sales teams or offices thereby increasing the number of sales professionals within such markets and iii opening sales offices in new metropolitan areas 

our target client size range is 50 to 5000 employees while we continue to serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one employee to many thousands of employees the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations increased the number of applications we offer and gained traction with larger companies we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of potential clients and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost to us because we charge our clients on a per employee basis for certain services we provide any increase or decrease in the number of employees of our clients will have a positive or negative impact respectively on our results of operations as discussed in more detail below client headcount fluctuations are particularly relevant in light of the ongoing covid19 pandemic generally we expect that changes in certain factors affecting our performance will correlate with improvement or deterioration in the labor market

based on our total revenues we have grown at a 26 compound annual growth rate from january 1 2017 through december 31 2020 growing our business has resulted in and will continue to result in substantial investments in sales professionals operating expenses system development and programming costs and general and administrative expenses which have increased and will continue to increase our expenses specifically our revenue growth and geographic expansion drive increases in our employee headcount which in turn precipitates increases in i salaries and benefits ii stockbased compensation expense and iii facility costs related to the expansion of our corporate headquarters and operations facilities and additional sales office leases

we believe the challenges of managing the everchanging complexity of payroll and human resources will continue to drive companies to turn to outsourced providers for help with their hcm needs the hcm industry historically has been driven in part by legislation and regulatory action including cobra changes to the minimum wage laws or overtime rules and legislation from federal state or municipal taxation authorities the implementation of the affordable care act the “aca” is an example of legislation that has created demand in the hcm industry we generate acarelated revenues i on an annual basis in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients and ii from clients who have purchased our enhanced aca application as part of the fixed bundled price charged per billing period while we generally do not track our revenues on an applicationbyapplication basis because applications are often sold in various groupings and configurations for a single price we estimate that if the aca is not modified or repealed revenues from our enhanced aca application and aca forms filings business will represent approximately 3 of total projected revenues for the year ending december 31 2021

for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 our gross margins were approximately 85 85 and 84 respectively although our gross margins may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonality and hiring trends we expect that our gross margins will remain relatively consistent in future periods

impact of the covid19 pandemic

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the covid19 outbreak to be a global pandemic in response federal state and local governments imposed various restrictions on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the disease and many such restrictions remain in place beginning in february 2020 we took various actions in order to minimize the risk of covid19 to our employees our clients and the communities in which we operate and in march 2020 we prohibited all businessrelated travel until further notice and began transitioning our employees to workfromhome arrangements our sales employees have been conducting all meetings with current and prospective clients virtually since march 2020 and we expect this practice to continue for the foreseeable future as of december 31 2020 96 of our employees were working remotely we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees and clients

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the operations of our clients and client prospects and may continue to do so for an indefinite period of time across many industries temporary and permanent business closures as well as business occupancy 

 

 

 

limitations have resulted in significant layoffs and employee furloughs since late march 2020 because we charge our clients on a peremployee basis for certain services we provide decreases in headcount at our clients as of the onset of the pandemic negatively impacted our recurring revenue during 2020 and we expect that our recurring revenue in future periods will continue to be negatively impacted by such headcount reductions until employment levels among such client base return to prepandemic levels further at the onset of the covid19 pandemic a limited number of new clients temporarily delayed service implementation as the covid19 pandemic continues to create uncertainty and the potential for ongoing business disruptions we may experience similar clientdriven delays in service implementation in the future 

in addition during 2019 interest earned on funds held for clients contributed to growth in recurring revenue due to both higher average interest rates and an increased average funds held for clients balance between august 2019 and march 2020 the federal open market committee reduced the target range for shortterm interest rates several times with the most significant rate cut occurring in march 2020 to support the economy and potentially reduce the impacts of the covid19 pandemic further a provision in the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” allowed employers to delay the payment of the employer’s share of social security taxes to a future date to the extent our clients made such an election we collected less money from them to hold and then remit to the appropriate taxing authorities which adversely affected our average funds held for clients balance and consequently interest earned on funds held for clients during 2020 despite the growth in the number of clients in our base employee headcount reductions at our clients as well as clients electing to defer payment of their share of social security taxes under the cares act resulted in nominal growth in our average funds held for clients balance relative to 2019 due to significantly lower average interest rates in 2020 and to a lesser extent the lack of growth of our average funds held for clients balance interest earned on funds held for clients for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased from the year ended december 31 2019 which had a negative effect on recurring revenue growth the average daily balance of funds held for clients was approximately 13 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to approximately 12 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019

demand for our solution remains high and in 2020 we continued to aggressively invest in sales and marketing and in research and development to drive future growth and expand our market share lower headcount at our clients and the other pandemicrelated factors described above which had and may continue to have a negative impact on recurring revenue combined with increased sales and marketing and research and development expenses resulted in a decrease in net income for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 we expect net income to be negatively affected by the impact of the pandemic on our recurring revenue and our deliberate increased level of investment to drive the growth of our business 

despite the economic challenges brought on by the covid19 pandemic we remain confident in the overall health of our business the strength of our product offerings and our ability to continue to execute on our strategy internally all applications within the paycom solution and more specifically employee selfservice manager onthego documents and checklists ask here and our enhanced learning management system have been instrumental in our ability to seamlessly manage and communicate with our remote workforce as many clients have also transitioned their workforces to workfromhome arrangements we believe they too are recognizing the benefits of these applications and our focus on employee usage as well as the strengths and advantages of our single database solution in contrast we believe the remote work environment is exposing the weaknesses and disadvantages arising from the combination of disparate systems offered by some of our competitors

prior to the covid19 pandemic our sales force historically traveled frequently to sell our solution the current remote work environment presents a unique opportunity for our sales force in that each sales employee is able to meet virtually with a greater number of client prospects in a given day than he or she would if conducting inperson meetings although we have not experienced such challenges to date if clients and client prospects are not as willing or available to engage via video conference and teleconference the shift from inperson to virtual sales meetings could negatively affect our sales efforts impede client acquisition and lengthen our sales cycles which would negatively impact our business and results of operations and could impact our financial condition in the future

we are unable to estimate the full impact that the covid19 pandemic could have on our business and results of operations in the future due to numerous uncertainties including the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak actions that may be taken by governmental authorities the impact to the business of our clients and other factors identified in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k further while our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable the effect of the ongoing covid19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods

 

 

 

 

key metrics 

in addition to the us gaap and nongaap metrics discussed elsewhere in this form 10k we also monitor the following metrics to evaluate our business measure our performance and identify trends affecting our business 

 



 

 









components of results of operations

sources of revenues 

revenues are comprised of recurring revenues and implementation and other revenues we expect our revenues to increase as we introduce new applications expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients as a percentage of total revenues we expect our mix of recurring revenues and implementation and other revenues to remain relatively constant

recurring revenues 

recurring revenues include fees for our talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for form filings and delivery of client payroll checks and reports these revenues are derived from i fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed or ii fixed amounts charged per billing period we do not require clients to enter into longterm contractual commitments with us our billing period varies by client based on when each client pays its employees which may be weekly biweekly semimonthly or monthly because recurring revenues are based in part on fees for use of our applications and the delivery of checks and reports that are levied on a peremployee basis our recurring revenues increase as our clients hire more employees recurring revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered 

recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs such as bonuses for our clients because payroll forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year and many of our clients are subject to aca form filing requirements in the first quarter first quarter revenues and margins are generally higher than in subsequent quarters we anticipate our revenues will continue to exhibit this seasonal pattern related to aca form filings for so long as the aca or replacement legislation includes employer reporting requirements in addition we often experience increased revenues during the fourth quarter due to unscheduled payroll runs for our 

 

 

 

clients that occur before the end of the year therefore we expect the seasonality of our revenue cycle to decrease to the extent clients utilize more of our nonpayroll applications 

recurring revenues also include interest earned on funds held for clients we collect funds from clients in advance of either the applicable due date for payroll tax submissions or the applicable disbursement date for employee payment services these collections from clients are typically disbursed from one to 30 days after receipt with some funds being held for up to 120 days we typically invest funds held for clients in money market funds demand deposit accounts commercial paper and certificates of deposit until they are paid to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees we expect interest earned on funds held for clients will increase as we introduce new applications expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients the amount of interest we earn from the investment of client funds is also impacted by changes in interest rates 

implementation and other revenues 

implementation and other revenues are comprised of implementation fees for the deployment of our solution and other revenues from sales of time clocks as part of our time and attendance services nonrefundable implementation fees are charged to new clients at inception and upon the addition of certain incremental applications for existing clients these fees range from 10 to 30 of the annualized value of the transaction implementation revenues are recognized as deferred revenue and amortized into income over the life of the client which is estimated to be ten years and other revenues are recognized upon shipment of time clocks implementation and other revenues comprised approximately 19 and 18 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

cost of revenues

cost of revenues consists of expenses related to hosting and supporting our applications hardware costs systems support and technology and depreciation and amortization these costs include employeerelated expenses including noncash stockbased compensation expenses and other expenses related to client support bank charges for processing ach transactions certain implementation expenses delivery charges and paper costs they also include our cost for time clocks sold and ongoing technology and support costs related to our systems the amount of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment allocated to cost of revenues is determined based upon an estimate of assets used to support our operations 

administrative expenses

administrative expenses consist of sales and marketing research and development general and administrative and depreciation and amortization sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employeerelated expenses for our direct sales and marketing staff such as the amortization of commissions and bonuses and noncash stockbased compensation expenses marketing expenses and other related costs research and development expenses consist primarily of employeerelated expenses including noncash stockbased compensation expenses for our development staff net of capitalized software costs for internally developed software we expect to grow our research and development efforts as we continue to broaden our payroll and hr solution offerings and extend our technological solutions by investing in the development of new applications and enhancements for existing applications general and administrative expenses consist of employeerelated expenses for finance and accounting legal human resources and management information systems personnel including noncash stockbased compensation expenses legal costs professional fees and other corporate expenses depreciation and amortization expenses consist of i the amount of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment allocated to administrative expenses based upon an estimate of assets used to support our selling general and administrative functions and ii amortization of intangible assets 

interest expense

interest expense includes interest on debt related to our corporate headquarters and settlements related to an interest rate swap we entered into in connection with such debt we capitalize interest incurred for indebtedness related to construction in progress

other income expense net

other income expense net includes interest earned on our own funds any gain or loss on the sale or disposal of fixed assets costs associated with the early repayment of debt and any unrealized gain or loss related to our interest rate swap 

provision for income taxes

our consolidated financial statements include a provision for income taxes incurred for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as for any operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we recognize a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 

 

 

 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of income data and such data as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods indicated as well as yearoveryear changes with respect to each line item refer to the annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 filed with the sec on february 13 2020 for a discussion of results for the year ended december 31 2018 



 

revenues

the increase in total revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 from the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily the result of i the addition of new clients and productivity and efficiency gains in mature sales offices which are offices that have been open for at least 24 months ii contributions from new sales offices opened in 2018 and 2019 that were progressing to maturity or reached maturity in 2020 and iii the sale of additional applications to our existing clients in addition the strong performance of our tax forms filing business in the first quarter contributed to the increase in total revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the covid19 pandemic has resulted in and may continue to result in headcount reductions across our client base because we charge our clients on a peremployee basis for certain services we provide the drivers of revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 described above were partially offset by the negative impact of headcount reductions within our client base as of the onset of the pandemic additionally lower employee headcount at our clients as well as clients electing the social security tax deferral under the cares act negatively impacted our average funds held for clients balance for the year ended december 31 2020 significantly lower average interest rates during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 as well as minimal growth in the average funds held for clients balance resulted in a decrease in interest earned on funds held for clients and consequently had a negative effect on recurring revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2020 we expect that the foregoing adverse macroeconomic factors may continue to have a negative effect on recurring revenues in future periods for so long as such conditions persist 

the increase in implementation and other revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 from the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily the result of the increased recognition of nonrefundable conversion fees that are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client setup these fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the tenyear estimated life of our clients

expenses

cost of revenues

during the year ended december 31 2020 operating expenses increased from the prior year by 84 million primarily due to an 82 million increase in expenses attributable to growth in the number of operating personnel as well as an increase of 16 million in 

 

 

 

automated clearing house fees these increases were partially offset by lower shipping and supplies fees  which decreased by 15 million d epreciation and amortization expense increased  5  4 million or 26  primarily due to the development of additional technology and purchases of other related fixed assets 

administrative expenses

sales and marketing

during the year ended december 31 2020 sales and marketing expenses increased from the prior year by 564 million due to a 399 million increase in marketing and advertising expense and a 166 million increase in employeerelated expenses including commissions bonuses and noncash stockbased compensation the increase in employeerelated expenses included a 64 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense

research and development

during the year ended december 31 2020 research and development expenses increased 172 million from the prior year due to an increase in employeerelated expenses including a 37 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense

as we continue the ongoing development of our platform and product offerings we generally expect research and development expenses exclusive of stockbased compensation to continue to increase particularly as we hire more personnel to support our growth while we expect this trend to continue on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of total revenues we also anticipate the rate of increase to decline over time as we leverage our growth and realize additional economies of scale as is customary for our business we also expect fluctuations in research and development expense as a percentage of revenue on a quartertoquarter basis due to seasonal revenue trends the introduction of new products the amount and timing of research and development costs that may be capitalized and the timing of onboarding new hires and restricted stock vesting events

expenditures for software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a threeyear period on a straightline basis the nature of the development projects underway during a particular period directly impacts the timing and extent of these capitalized expenditures and can affect the amount of research and development expenses in such period the table below sets forth the amounts of capitalized and expensed research and development costs for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019

 



 

general and administrative

during the year ended december 31 2020 general and administrative expenses increased by 507 million from the prior year due to a 491 million increase in employeerelated expenses which included a 319 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense and a 16 million increase in accounting and legal expenses related to regulatory and compliance matters

noncash stockbased compensation expense



 

 

 

 

during the year ended december 31 20 20  our noncash stockbased compensation expense increased  42  8 million from the prior year primarily due to the issuance and subsequent accelerated vesting of restricted stock subject to marketbased vesting conditions during 20 20  which exceeded expenses associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock subject to marketbased vesting conditions in 201 9  

depreciation and amortization

during the year ended december 31 2020 depreciation and amortization expense increased from the prior year primarily due to the development of additional technology and purchases of other related fixed assets

interest expense

the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2020 was due to the timing of construction of our expanded operations facility in grapevine texas which resulted in more capitalized interest in 2020 

other income expense net

the change in other income expense net for the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swap as compared to the year ended december 31 2019

provision for income taxes

the provision for income taxes is based on a current estimate of the annual effective income tax rate adjusted to reflect the impact of discrete items our effective income tax rate was 23 and 20 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the higher effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily resulted from the increase in state income taxes and nondeductible expenses

liquidity and capital resources

our principal sources of capital and liquidity are our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents are comprised primarily of demand deposit accounts money market funds and certificates of deposit additionally we maintain a senior secured revolving credit facility the “facility” which can be accessed as needed to supplement our operating cash flow and cash balances the facility provides us the ability to borrow funds in the aggregate principal amount of 750 million which may be increased up to 1250 million subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying certain other conditions we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months 

we have historically funded our operations from cash flows generated from operations cash from the sale of equity securities and debt financing although we have funded most of the costs for construction projects at our corporate headquarters and other facilities from available cash we have incurred indebtedness for a portion of these costs further all purchases under our stock repurchase plans were paid for from available cash 

term credit agreement as of december 31 2020 our indebtedness consisted solely of term loans the “term loans” made under a senior secured term credit agreement as amended from time to time the “term credit agreement” among the company certain of our subsidiaries jpmorgan chase bank na bank of america na and kirkpatrick bank all term loans were used to finance construction projects at our corporate headquarters our obligations under the term loans are secured by a mortgage and first priority security interest in our headquarters property the term loans mature on september 7 2025 and bear interest at our option at either a a prime rate plus 10 or b an adjusted libor rate for the interest period in effect for such term loan plus 15 

under the term credit agreement we are required to comply with certain financial and nonfinancial covenants including maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 125 to 10 and a funded indebtedness to ebitda ratio of not greater than 20 to 10 additionally the term credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including covenants limiting our ability to among other things grant liens incur debt effect certain mergers make investments dispose of assets enter into certain transactions including swap agreements and sale and leaseback transactions pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock and enter into transactions with affiliates in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit agreement of this size and type as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in the term credit agreement

interest rate swap agreement in connection with entering into the term credit agreement we also entered into a floatingtofixed interest rate swap agreement to limit the exposure to interest rate risk related to the term loans the “interest rate swap agreement” the interest rate swap agreement which has a maturity date of september 7 2025 provides that we will receive quarterly variable interest payments based on the libor rate and will pay interest at a fixed rate we have elected not to designate this interest rate swap as a hedge and as such changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we recognized losses of 14 million for the change in fair value of the interest rate swap which is included in other income expense net in the consolidated statements of income 

 

 

 

revolving credit agreement   on february 12 2018 we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement the “revolving credit agreement” with jpmorgan chase bank na and bank of america na that provided for the facility in the aggregate principal amount of 500 million the “revolving commitment” which could be increased to up to 1000 million subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying certain other conditions the facility includes a 50 million sublimit for swingline loans and a 25 million s ublimit for letters of credit the facility was scheduled t o mature on february 12 2020 on april 15 2019 we entered into the first amendment to revolving credit agreement the “first amendment” pursuant to the first amendment wells fargo bank na was added as a lender and the revolving commitment was increased to 750 million which may be further increased to 1250 million subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying other conditions  t he scheduled maturity date of the facility was also extended to april 15 2022 

borrowings under the facility will generally bear interest at a prime rate plus 10 or at our option an adjusted libor rate for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus 15 in each case subject to certain conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreement as of december 31 2020 we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the facility

stock repurchase plan and withholding shares to cover taxes in may 2016 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan allowing for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in open market transactions at prevailing market prices in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws including rule 10b51 programs since the initial authorization of the stock repurchase plan our board of directors has amended and extended and authorized new stock repurchase plans from time to time most recently in march 2020 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 2500 million of our common stock our stock repurchase plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time the actual timing number and value of shares repurchased depends on a number of factors including the market price of our common stock general market and economic conditions the shares withheld for taxes associated with the vesting of restricted stock and other corporate considerations 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we repurchased an aggregate of 432897 shares of common stock at an average cost of 26531 per share including 188466 shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations for certain employees upon the vesting of restricted stock our payment of the taxes on behalf of those employees resulted in an aggregate cash expenditure of 628 million and as such we generally subtract the amounts attributable to such withheld shares from the aggregate amount available for future purchases under our stock repurchase plan as of december 31 2020 there was 1353 million available for repurchases the stock repurchase plan will expire on march 12 2022 

cash flow analysis

our cash flows from operating activities have historically been significantly impacted by profitability implementation revenues received but deferred our investment in sales and marketing to drive growth and research and development our ability to meet future liquidity needs will be driven by our operating performance and the extent of continued investment in our operations failure to generate sufficient revenues and related cash flows could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our liquidity needs and achieve our business objectives

as our business grows we expect our capital expenditures and our investment activity to continue to increase we are currently focused on the ongoing construction of our new texas operations facility in grapevine texas capital expenditures related to the construction of the facility began in the second quarter of 2019 on august 5 2019 we purchased 1075 acres of land adjacent to our corporate headquarters in oklahoma city for 192 million we expect a portion of this land will be utilized to facilitate our growth in the future depending on certain growth opportunities we may choose to accelerate investments in sales and marketing acquisitions technology and services actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our future revenues cash from operating activities and the level of expenditures in all areas of our business 

as part of our payroll and payroll tax filing services we collect funds from our clients for federal state and local employment taxes which we remit to the appropriate tax agencies we invest these funds in money market funds demand deposit accounts commercial paper and certificates of deposit from which we earn interest income during the period between their receipt and disbursement

our cash flows from investing and financing activities are influenced by the amount of funds held for clients which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter the balance of the funds we hold depends on our clients’ payroll calendars and therefore such balance changes from period to period in accordance with the timing of each payroll cycle 

our cash flows from financing activities are also affected by the extent to which we use available cash to purchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase plan as well as restricted stock vesting events that result in net share settlements and the company paying withholding taxes on behalf of certain employees

 

 

 

the following table summarizes the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 20 20 and 201 9  



operating activities

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily consisted of payments received from our clients and interest earned on funds held for clients cash used in operating activities primarily consisted of personnelrelated expenditures to support the growth and infrastructure of our business these payments included costs of operations advertising and other sales and marketing efforts it infrastructure development product research and development and security and administrative costs compared to the year ended december 31 2019 our operating cash flows for the year ended december 31 2020 were positively impacted by the growth of our business

investing activities

cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased from the prior year period due to a 2398 million increase in proceeds from maturities of shortterm investments from funds held for clients partially offset by a 1369 million increase in purchases of shortterm investments from funds held for clients and a 12 million increase in cash used for purchases of property and equipment

financing activities

cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased from the prior year period primarily due to the impact of 7443 million of changes in client funds obligation which is due to the timing of receipts from our clients and payments made to our clients’ employees and applicable taxing authorities on their behalf additionally cash flows from financing activities were impacted by a 520 million increase in repurchases of common stock as well as a 203 million increase in withholding taxes paid related to net share settlements

contractual obligations

our principal commitments primarily consist of longterm debt and leases for office space we disclose our longterm debt in note 6 and our commitments and contingencies in note 12 in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

as of december 31 2020 the future noncancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows

 



 

we plan to continue to lease additional office space to support our growth in addition many of our existing lease agreements provide us with the option to renew when applicable our future operating lease obligations include payments due during any renewal period provided for in the lease where the lease imposes a penalty for failure to renew

the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum services to be used fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above

 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2020 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that may be material to investors

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results may materially differ from these estimates made by management under different assumptions and conditions

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are described below accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations

revenue recognition

revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to for those goods or services substantially all of our revenues are comprised of revenue from contracts with clients sales and other applicable taxes are excluded from revenues

recurring revenues are derived primarily from our talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for form ﬁlings and delivery of client payroll checks and reports talent acquisition includes our applicant tracking candidate tracker background check onboarding everify and tax credit services applications time and labor management includes time and attendance schedulingschedule exchange timeoff requests labor allocation labor management reportspush reporting and geofencinggeotracking payroll includes our payroll and tax management paycom pay expense management garnishment management and gl concierge applications talent management includes our employee selfservice compensation budgeting performance management executive dashboard and paycom learning and course content applications hr management includes our document and task management government and compliance beneﬁts administration benefit enrollment services cobra administration personnel action forms surveys and enhanced aca applications

the performance obligations related to recurring revenues are satisfied during each client’s payroll period with the agreedupon fee being charged and collected as part of our processing of the client’s payroll recurring revenues are recognized at the conclusion of processing of each client’s payroll period when each respective payroll client is billed collectability is reasonably assured as the fees are collected through an automated clearing house as part of the client’s payroll cycle or through direct wire transfer which minimizes the default risk 

the contract period for substantially all contracts associated with these revenues is one month due to the fact that both we and the client have the unilateral right to terminate a wholly unperformed contract without compensating the other party by providing 30 days’ notice of termination our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications for clients who purchase multiple applications due to the shortterm nature of our contracts we do not believe it is meaningful to separately assess and identify whether or not each application potentially represents its own individual performance obligation as the revenue generated from each application is recognized within the same month as the revenue from the core payroll application similarly we do not believe it is meaningful to individually determine the standalone selling price for each application we consider the total price charged to a client in a given period to be indicative of the standalone selling price as the total amount charged is within a reasonable range of prices typically charged for our goods and services for comparable classes of client groups 

implementation and other revenues consist of nonrefundable upfront conversion fees which are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client setup as well as revenues from the sale of time clocks as part of our employee time and attendance services although these revenues are related to our recurring revenues they represent distinct performance obligations 

implementation activities primarily represent administrative activities that allow us to fulfill future performance obligations for our clients and do not represent services transferred to the client however the nonrefundable upfront fee charged to our clients results in an implied performance obligation in the form of a material right to the client related to the client’s option to renew at the end of each 30day contract period further given that all other services within the contract are sold at a total price indicative of the standalone selling price coupled with the fact that the upfront fees are consistent with upfront fees charged in similar contracts that we have with clients the standalone selling price of the client’s option to renew the contract approximates the dollar amount of the nonrefundable upfront fee the nonrefundable upfront fee is typically included on the client’s first invoice and is deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated renewal period ie tenyear estimated client life 

 

 

 

revenue s from the sale of time clocks are recognized when control is transferred to the client upon delivery of the product we estimate the standalone selling price for the time clocks by maximizing the use of observable inputs such as our specific pricing practices for time clocks 

goodwill and other intangible assets

goodwill is not amortized but we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually or earlier if at the reporting unit level an indicator of impairment arises our business is largely homogeneous and as a result goodwill is associated with one reporting unit we have selected june 30 as our annual goodwill impairment testing date a review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable the company performed a qualitative assessment to determine if it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of the reporting units had declined below its carrying value in the qualitative assessment we consider the macroeconomic conditions including any deterioration of general economic conditions industry and market conditions including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates changes in the productsservices and regulator and political developments cost of doing business overall financial performance other relevant reporting unit specific facts such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation based on our assessment there was no impairment recorded as of june 30 2020 for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 there were no indicators of impairment intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives

impairment of longlived assets

longlived assets including intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset we have determined that there is no impairment of longlived assets for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018

marketbased restricted stock awards

we measure noncash stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock awards issued by using a monte carlo simulation model this model considers various subjective assumptions as inputs and represent our best estimates which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment as it relates to market volatilities the historical volatility of our stock price riskfree rates and expected life the valuation model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data determining these assumptions is subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our marketbased stock awards and the associated compensation expense refer to note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stockbased compensation awards

nongaap financial measures

management uses adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income as supplemental measures to review and assess the performance of our core business operations and for planning purposes we define i adjusted ebitda as net income plus interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization noncash stockbased compensation expense certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations if any and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap and ii nongaap net income as net income plus noncash stockbased compensation expense certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations if any and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap all of which are adjusted for the effect of income taxes adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income are metrics that provide investors with greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking we believe these metrics are useful to investors because they facilitate comparisons of our core business operations across periods on a consistent basis as well as comparisons with the results of peer companies many of which use similar nongaap financial measures to supplement results under us gaap in addition adjusted ebitda is a measure that provides useful information to management about the amount of cash available for reinvestment in our business repurchasing common stock and other purposes management believes that the nongaap measures presented in this form 10k when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with us gaap provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business and performance

 

 

 

adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income are not measures of financial performance under us gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income which we consider to be the most directly comparable us gaap measure adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing our operating performance you should not consider adjusted ebitda or nongaap net income in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other consolidated statements of income data prepared in accordance with us gaap adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income may not be comparable to similar titled measures of other companies and other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do 

the following tables reconcile net income to adjusted ebitda net income to nongaap net income and earnings per share to nongaap net income per share on a basic and diluted basis refer to our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 filed with the sec on february 13 2020 for a presentation of the 2018 amounts 

 



 



 

 

 

  



 

 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitat ive disclosures about market risk 

interest rate sensitivity

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 1517 million as of december 31 2020 these amounts are invested primarily in demand deposit accounts and money market funds we consider all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less and secregistered money market mutual funds to be cash equivalents the primary objectives of our investing activities are capital preservation meeting our liquidity needs and with respect to investing client funds generating interest income while maintaining the safety of principal we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes

our cash equivalents are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates the market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates

as described elsewhere in this form 10k the term loans made under the term credit agreement bear interest at our option at either a a prime rate plus 10 or b an adjusted libor rate for the interest period in effect for such term loan plus 15 as a result we are exposed to increased interest rate risk to mitigate the increased interest rate risk we entered into the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate swap agreement has effectively fixed our interest rate at 40 eliminating a portion of the variable rate and coinciding interest rate risk associated with the term loans as of december 31 2020 an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points would not have had a material effect on our operating results or financial condition

as described elsewhere in this form 10k the revolving credit agreement as amended provides for a facility in the aggregate amount of 750 million which may be increased to up to 1250 million borrowings under the facility will generally bear interest at a prime rate plus 10 or at our option an adjusted libor rate for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus 15 as of december 31 2020 we have not made any draws under the facility to the extent we make draws under the facility in the future we may be exposed to increased interest rate risk

overview

we are a leading provider of comprehensive cloudbased human capital management “hcm” solution delivered as softwareas aservice “saas” we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment lifecycle from recruitment to retirement our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions including talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and human resources “hr” management applications our userfriendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees enabling selfmanagement of their hcm activities in the cloud which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity

we were founded in 1998 and became a publicly traded company through our initial public offering in 2014 since our founding we have focused on providing an innovative saas hcm solution organizations need sophisticated flexible and intuitive applications that can quickly adapt to their evolving hcm requirements streamline their hr processes and systems and enable them to control costs we believe the hcm needs of most organizations are currently served either by multiple providers in an attempt to replicate a comprehensive saas product or to a lesser extent by legacy providers offering outdated onpremise products these approaches often result in challenges with system integration and data integrity low scalability high costs extended delivery times and large upfront capital requirements 

because our solution was developed inhouse and is based on a single platform there is no need to integrate update or access multiple databases which are common issues with competitor offerings that use multiple thirdparty systems in order to link together their hcm offerings additionally our solution maintains data integrity for accurate actionable and realtime analytics and business intelligence and helps clients minimize the risks of compliance errors due to inaccurate or missing information we deliver feature rich applications while maintaining excellence in information security and quality management standards as evidenced by our international organization for standardization “iso” certifications

we sell our solution directly through our internally trained clientfocused and highly skilled sales force based in offices across the united states as a part of our client retention effort a specialist within a dedicated team is assigned to each client to provide industryleading personalized service we have over 26500 clients none of which constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 we believe that as a result of our focus on client experience we enjoy high client satisfaction as evidenced by an annual revenue retention rate of 93 92 and 91 from existing clients for the years ended 

 

 

december 31 2019 2018 and 2017  respectively we believe our revenue retention rate understates our client loyalty because this rate is decreased by former clients that were acquired or otherwise ceased operations 

we currently derive the majority of our revenues from payroll processing we are able to determine revenues from payroll processing because all of our clients are required to utilize our payroll application in order to access our other applications we generally do not separately track our revenues across our other applications because we often sell applications in various groupings and configurations for a single price

the paycom solution

we offer an endtoend saas hcm solution that provides our clients and their employees with immediate access to accurate and secure information and analytics at any time from any location where internet service is available we believe our solution delivers the following benefits

enhanced employee experience 

the employees of our clients also benefit from our hcm applications as workforces transition from technology–savvy to technologydependent employees expect mobile technology and the resources necessary to readily access information and control their professional development through our employee selfservice technology employees can view realtime hr information including pay stubs w2s and benefits information as well as manage their schedules and vacation time and update w4 contact information our mobile app makes it easier for employees to access their selfservice information our app has fingerprint and facial recognition capabilities aiding employers in their efforts to engage technologydependent workers our system also allows employers to engage their workforce through learning management courses and training paths surveys and performance goals and reviews

in addition to our selfservice appbased functionality we also provide our clients with a strategy to drive usage among their employees this strategy includes training clients’ employees how to use the paycom app during implementation and providing additional training from our client relations representatives allowing employees to make changes directly to our database creates efficiencies for both the employer and employee today’s employees have little tolerance for complexity and with our solution employees have become accustomed to having a direct relationship with their hr database this relationship is directly correlated with our singledatabase that is key to increasing usage our strategy to promote employee usage of the paycom system elevates hr personnel to focus on the human element of their jobs creating a more positive culture and giving hr personnel more time to engage with their employees

softwareasaservice delivery model

our saas delivery model allows clients with geographically dispersed and mobile workforces to operate more efficiently and allows these clients to implement access and use our clientoriented internet solution on demand and remotely through standard web browsers smart phones tablets and other webenabled devices our saas solution reduces the time risk headcount and costs associated with installing and maintaining applications for onpremise products within the information technology “it” infrastructure of our clients

secure cloudbased architecture

our cloudbased architecture allows our solution to be implemented remotely with minimal client interaction updates such as software enhancements and newly developed applications can be deployed without client interaction disruption or involvement allowing our clients to make a smaller investment in hardware personnel implementation time and consulting additionally we own and maintain all of the infrastructure technology to host our solution and to maximize system availability for clients our focus on and investment in technology and data security has been recognized with isoiec 270012013 certified security standards that provide our clients with a “bestinclass” level of data security

scalability to grow with our clients

our solution is highly scalable we serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one employee to many thousands of employees while our target client size range is 50 to 5000 employees we calculate the number of clients’ employees based on parent company grouping our clients are able to use the same solution while their businesses grow by deploying applications asneeded in realtime pricing is determined by employee headcount and the number of applications utilized enabling our clients to align hcm spending with their evolving hcm needs as compared to traditional hcm products that require clients to migrate to new software as they grow but retain fixed costs even if the client shrinks in size

efficient and productive research and development

we believe we benefit from a competitive advantage with our research and development investments people and processes early investments in our proprietary cloudbased architecture enable us to develop and deploy applications in a timely and costeffective manner we have also chosen to base our research and development team in oklahoma and texas which we believe provides us with highquality talent at a lower cost compared to other locations in the united states where there is more competition for technology talent these strategic decisions have enabled us to have a highly productive research and development function

our strategy for growth 

our strategy is to continue to establish our solution as the hcm industry standard by increasing our presence in existing markets and expanding into additional markets we intend to continue to open new sales offices as well as potentially expand over the longer term into international markets we will also execute our strategy for growth by targeting larger clients as well as strengthening and extending our solution 

increase our presence in existing markets 

we believe a significant market opportunity exists to increase our presence within markets where we currently have a sales office each sales office is typically staffed with one sales team with each team comprised of a sales manager and approximately six to eight other sales professionals although we have a sales office in 38 of the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas “msas” in the united states based on july 2018 us census bureau estimates only five of these msas are currently served by multiple paycom sales teams we plan to further penetrate and more effectively capture existing markets by adding sales offices and increasing the number of sales teams in such markets

expand into additional markets

we plan to continue expanding our sales capability by opening sales offices in certain metropolitan areas where we currently have no sales teams we have historically selected new locations based on potential client and employee demographics as well as business density when opening a new sales office we typically relocate a proven sales manager from an existing territory who then recruits a team of highperforming sales representatives it typically takes a new sales office 24 months to reach maturity 

 

 

enlarge our existing client relationships 

we dedicate our resources to helping our clients facilitate their goals whether through helping our clients execute better hiring decisions manage compensation more effectively or simply operate more efficiently we believe a significant growth opportunity exists in selling additional applications to our current clients many clients have subsequently deployed additional applications as they recognize the benefits of our comprehensive solution as we extend and enhance the functionality of our solution we will continue to invest in initiatives to increase the adoption of our solution and maintain our high levels of client satisfaction

target larger clients

the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations and increased the number of applications we offer our solution requires no adjustment to serve larger clients we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost to us to further capitalize on this opportunity we intend to continue targeting larger businesses opportunistically where our current sales model is effective

maintain our leadership in innovation by strengthening and extending our solution

our ability to develop and deploy new applications and updates rapidly and costeffectively has been integral to the results that we have achieved to date we intend to continue extending the functionality and range of our solution in the future our development efforts are performed exclusively inhouse and are heavily based upon proactive research and client input we are focusing our investments on the development of new applications enhancements and learning courses that are responsive to the needs of our clients which are garnered through ongoing client interaction and collaboration

many small to midsized companies can typically make the decision to adopt our solution more quickly than larger companies which we believe results in a shorter sales cycle and more closely corresponds to our target sales cycle of 30 to 90 days as a result of the nature and size of our clientele we maintain a diversified client base and very low revenue concentration among our clients we believe however that larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients we serve and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost as we attract clients at the higher end of our target client size range we may face longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales 

competition 

the market for hcm solutions is rapidly evolving highly competitive and subject to changing technology shifting client needs and frequent introduction of new products and services our competitors range from small regional firms to large wellestablished international firms with multiple product offerings

we compete with firms that provide hcm solutions by various means many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software but as demand for greater flexibility and access to information grows we believe there will be increased competition in the delivery of hcm cloudbased solutions by other saas providers our competitors offer hcm solutions that may overlap with one several or all categories of applications and include companies such as automatic data processing inc ceridian hcm inc cornerstone ondemand inc oracle corporation paychex inc paylocity holding corporation paycor inc sap se the ultimate software group workday inc and other local and regional providers 

 

 

competition in the hcm solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation breadth of service application offering and price the importance of these factors depends on the size of the business price tends to be the most important factor of competition for smaller businesses with fewer employees while the scope of features and customization is more important to larger businesses regardless of a company’s size another important factor is the implementation experience as all organizations are seeking a streamlined and simplified process 

sales and marketing

technology operations and security

technology

our multitenant architecture enables us to deliver our solution across our client base with a single instance of our solution while securely partitioning access to our clients’ respective application data because a single version of our solution is developed supported and deployed across all of our clients updates are delivered to all of our clients at the same time making it easier to scale our solution as our number of clients and their respective employee headcounts increase

we maintain multiple loadbalanced internet lines serviced by multiple networks to provide our clients continuous access to our solution and their stored data we back up our client data at regular intervals utilizing live replication snapshots and cold archive methods of backup and manually monitor backup success and failure regularly our server cluster and database servers are fully redundant to ensure continuous service in the event of a disk failure

security 

we maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of our clients’ data during the regular course of business we receive client data through our online system that we in turn process record and store following isoiec 270012013 certified controls and procedures all communications with our servers that might contain sensitive information are encrypted before they leave the network and our servers are configured to only allow highgrade encryption algorithms

we strictly regulate and limit all access to servers and networks at each of our facilities local network access is restricted by our authenticated server using access control lists and remote network access is restricted by a firewall which provides no accessible route from external networks to systems within our local network we also employ network and host intrusion detection and prevention sensors throughout our infrastructure systems that monitor that infrastructure and alert our security department of cybersecurity issues a system for managing and installing patches for unsecure thirdparty applications and highly restricted access to the internet for anyone who has access to client data our information security department regularly performs penetration testing and we retain a thirdparty penetration testing company to conduct penetration tests and periodic audits to identify and remediate any issues

our applications are secured using multiple libraries and secure coding practices our it infrastructure is secured and monitored using a number of best practices and tools at multiple layers of the physical and logical network this security is also continually monitored by our information security department all of our operations employees work in either our oklahoma or texas locations and with the exception of certain it personnel are not permitted to work remotely

software development

our application development team works closely with our clients to enhance our existing application offerings and develop new applications this process is led by experienced product managers who oversee the evolution of their respective applications within a focused timeframe of innovation and cultivation in order to deliver the welldeveloped applications and enhancements desired by our clients our product managers are proactive in their approach to assigning development requests based on research trends and user feedback a key element of our development process is the oneonone personal interaction between clients and our crrs through whom our clients personally suggest new applications and features

we develop our solution from the “ground up” with our internal development and engineering teams our development and engineering teams and our employees conceive new applications and enhancements review requests schedule development in order of priority and subsequently develop the applications or enhancements our new applications and enhancements are independently reviewed by the quality assurance team in accordance with our software development process before being fully implemented any enhancements to our applications are released on a monthly scheduled release date to coordinate the communication and release to our clients

client service

we are committed to providing industryleading clientcentered service for this reason we assign each client a specialist within a dedicated team this oneonone service is a key part of our client service model and helps to ensure we are delivering an industryleading solution and maintaining high client satisfaction the primary elements of our client service model include the following

streamlined setup and onboarding

after electing to deploy our solution a new client begins our onboarding process with assistance from a team of new client setup specialists and the sales representative responsible for obtaining the client’s business in addition we also have a team of transition specialists whose job it is to ensure that the process is performed smoothly data is collected properly and all relevant employees are fully trained on the system this team works closely with the client until the client is capable of managing our solution independently at which time responsibility for the client relationship is transferred to our dedicated crrs and service specialists unlike certain of our competitors we do not outsource any of our onboarding efforts

dedicated service specialists

after completing the onboarding process each client is assigned to a service specialist within a dedicated team clients can then contact their dedicated service specialist or a team member if any issues or questions arise these specialists provide personalized service with actual knowledge of the clients’ business needs when appropriate client questions can be elevated to the specialists with the appropriate application expertise in addition our crrs proactively contact our clients to ensure satisfaction with our solution and introduce additional applications

 

 

expert level service 

our service specialists are trained across all of our applications to ensure that they can provide comprehensive expertlevel service our client service is iso 90012015 certified and helps support our high client retention rate

regulatory and certifications

we are subject to varying degrees of regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide services local laws and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement differ significantly among those jurisdictions these regulations and laws cover among others information privacy

data privacy has become a significant issue in the united states and in other countries the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future many federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations affecting or regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information in the united states these include for example rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca state breach notification laws and state privacy laws such as the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the “ccpa” and the illinois biometric information privacy act the “ibipa” further because some of our clients have establishments in the european union the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” may impact our processing of certain client and employee information

we voluntarily obtain thirdparty security examinations relating to our internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with system and organization controls report i “soc 1” our soc 1 examination is conducted every six months by one of the four largest independent international auditing firms and addresses among other areas our physical and environmental safeguards for production data centers data availability and integrity procedures change management procedures and logical security procedures we also obtain thirdparty examinations relating to our internal controls over security and privacy in accordance with system and organization controls report ii “soc 2” our soc 2 examination is conducted every year by one of the four largest independent international auditing firms and addresses among other areas internal controls around security availability processing integrity confidentiality and privacy

in april 2017 we renewed a certification based on iso 90012015 criteria a standard for the implementation of quality management processes published by iso covering our activities required to create and deliver our solution this independent assessment of our conformity to the iso 90012015 standard includes assessing the design and implementation of quality objectives to meet delivery standards on an ongoing basis the certification is valid until april 2020 with continuing assessments taking place annually 

in january 2019 we obtained a certification based on iso 223012012 criteria a standard for implementing and managing an effective business continuity management system bcms published by iso this international standard for continuity management specifies requirements to plan implement operate and continually improve a documented management system to protect against prepare for respond to and recover from disruptive incidents when they arise the certification is valid until january 2022 with continuing assessments taking place annually 

in february 2020 we renewed a certification based on isoiec 270012013 criteria a security standard for information security management systems published by iso covering our production quality assurance and implementation environments this independent assessment of our conformity to the iso 27001 standard includes assessing security risks designing and implementing comprehensive security controls and adopting an information security management process to meet security needs on an ongoing basis the certification is valid through february 2023 with continuing assessments taking place annually

intellectual property

we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights we also have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we do not have any patents or patent applications pending

seasonality

our revenues are seasonal in nature recurring revenues include revenues related to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs such as bonuses for our clients because payroll forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year and many of our clients are also subject to aca form filing requirements in the first quarter first quarter revenues and margins are generally higher than in subsequent quarters we anticipate that our revenues will continue to exhibit this seasonal pattern related to aca form filings for so long as the aca or replacement legislation includes employer reporting requirements in addition we often experience increased revenues during the fourth quarter due to unscheduled payroll runs for our clients that occur before the end of the year therefore we expect the seasonality of our revenue cycle to decrease to the extent clients utilize more of our nonpayroll applications

 

 

employees 

our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees is critical to our continued success we invest heavily in our training and leadership development programs to encourage the development and promotion of our employees as of december 31 2019 we employed 3765 people substantially all of which are fulltime none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

segment information

we operate in a single operating segment and a single reporting segment operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker function which is fulfilled by our chief executive officer in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance our chief executive officer allocates resources and assesses performance based upon financial information at the consolidated level since we operate in one operating segment all required financial segment information is presented in the consolidated financial statements

risk factors 

tableend

the risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this form 10k including those risks identified in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” describe examples of risks uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statement if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect actual outcomes may vary materially from those included in this form 10k

changes in laws government regulations and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

many of our applications are designed to assist our clients in complying with government regulations that continually change the introduction of new regulatory requirements or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations could increase our cost of doing business changing regulatory requirements may make the introduction of new applications and enhancements more costly or more timeconsuming than we currently anticipate or could prevent the introduction of new applications and enhancements by us altogether changes in laws regulations or policies could also affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for certain of our existing applications or services which would result in decreased revenues further we may spend time and money developing new applications and enhancements that due to regulatory changes become unnecessary prior to being released in addition any failure to educate and assist our clients with respect to new or revised legislation that impacts them could have an adverse effect on our reputation and any failure to modify our applications or develop new applications in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in addition federal state and foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet as a commercial medium changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our applications further government agencies or private organizations may impose taxes fees or other charges for accessing the internet or commerce conducted via the internet these laws or charges could limit the growth of internetrelated commerce or communications generally or could result in reductions in the demand for internetbased applications such as ours

if our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to our clients’ or their employees’ sensitive data is otherwise obtained our solution may not be perceived as being secure clients may reduce the use of or stop using our solution our ability to attract new clients may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities

our solution involves the collection storage and transmission of clients’ and their employees’ confidential and proprietary information including personal identifying information as well as financial and payroll data hcm software is often targeted in cyberattacks including computer viruses worms phishing attacks malicious software programs and other information security breaches which could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our clients’ sensitive data or otherwise disrupt our clients’ or other third parties’ business operations if cybercriminals are able to circumvent our security measures or if we are unable to detect an intrusion into our systems and contain such intrusion in a reasonable amount of time our clients’ sensitive data may be compromised

 

 

certain of our employees have access to sensitive information about our clients’ employees while we conduct background checks of our employees and limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls resulting in a security breach 

although we have security measures in place to protect client information and prevent data loss and other security breaches these measures could be breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error thirdparty or employee malfeasance or otherwise because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently we may not be able to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative or protective measures while we currently maintain a cyber liability insurance policy cyber liability insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our cyber liability insurance policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention from our business and operations

any actual or perceived breach of our security could damage our reputation cause existing clients to discontinue the use of our solution prevent us from attracting new clients or subject us to thirdparty lawsuits regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

any damage failure or disruption of our saas network infrastructure or data centers could impair our ability to effectively provide our solution harm our reputation and adversely affect our business

our saas network infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations our clients access our solution through standard web browsers smart phones tablets and other webenabled devices and depend on us for fast and reliable access to our solution we serve all of our clients from our three fully redundant data centers located in oklahoma and texas our saas network infrastructure and data centers are vulnerable to damage failure and disruption 

in the future we may experience issues with our computing and communications infrastructure or data centers caused by the following factors

















if our saas network infrastructure or our clients’ ability to access our solution is interrupted client and employee data from recent transactions may be permanently lost and we could be exposed to significant claims by clients particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds payable to employees further any adverse changes in service levels at our data centers resulting from damage to or failure of our data centers could result in disruptions in our services any significant instances of system downtime or performance problems at our data centers could negatively affect our reputation and ability to attract new clients prevent us from gaining new or additional business from our current clients or cause our current clients to terminate their use of our solution any of which would adversely impact our revenues in addition if our network infrastructure and data centers fail to support increased capacity due to growth in our business our clients may experience interruptions in the availability of our solution such interruptions may reduce our revenues cause us to issue refunds to clients or adversely affect our retention of existing clients any of which could have a negative impact on our business operating results or financial condition

privacy concerns and laws or other regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our applications 

our applications are subject to various complex laws and regulations on the federal state and local levels including those governing data security and privacy which have become significant issues globally the regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future many federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information in the united states these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca federal and state labor and employment laws state data breach notification laws and state privacy laws such as the ccpa and ibipa the ccpa provides consumers with a private right of action if covered companies suffer a data breach related to their failure to implement reasonable security measures and the ibipa includes a private right of action for persons who are aggrieved by violations 

 

 

of the ibipa further because some of our clients have establishments in the european union gdpr may impact our processing of certain client and employee information failure to comply with data protection and privacy laws and regulations could result in regulatory scrutiny and increased exposure to the risk of litigation or the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition moreover allegations of noncompliance whether or not true could be costly time consuming distracting to management and cause reputational harm 

in addition to government regulation privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different selfregulatory standards because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws are still uncertain it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our solution any failure to comply with government regulations that apply to our applications including privacy and data protection laws could subject us to liability in addition to the possibility of fines lawsuits and other claims we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our solution which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition any inability to adequately address privacy concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws regulations and policies could result in additional cost and liability to us damage our reputation inhibit sales and adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

furthermore privacy concerns may cause our clients’ employees to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our clients and their employees to use our applications effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our applications in certain industries all of these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the ability of our clients to process handle store use and transmit demographic and personal information from their employees which could reduce demand for our solution 

if we are not able to develop enhancements and new applications keep pace with technological developments or respond to future disruptive technologies we might not remain competitive and our business could be adversely affected

our continued success will depend on our ability to adapt and innovate in order to attract new clients and increase revenues from existing clients we need to enhance add new features to and improve our existing applications and introduce new applications the success of any enhancements or new features and applications depends on several factors including timely completion and introduction and market acceptance we may expend significant time and resources developing and pursuing sales of a particular enhancement or application that may not result in revenues in the anticipated time frame or at all or may not result in revenue growth sufficient to offset increased expenses further changing legal and regulatory requirements may delay the development or introduction of enhancements or new applications or render certain of our applications obsolete if we are unable to successfully develop enhancements new features or new applications to meet client needs our business and operating results could be adversely affected

in addition because our applications are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using internet tools and protocols we must continuously modify and enhance our applications to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies if we are unable to respond in a timely and costeffective manner to these rapid technological developments our current and future applications may become less marketable and less competitive or even obsolete

our success is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver hcm solutions at lower prices more efficiently or more conveniently such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete

the market in which we participate is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected

the market for hcm software is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented we expect competition to intensify in the future with the introduction of new technologies and new market entrants many of our current and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition longer operating histories more established relationships in the industry and significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as a result some of these competitors may be able to











 

 





some of our principal competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures similarly some competitors offer different billing terms which has resulted in pressures on our billing terms if we are unable to maintain our pricing levels and our billing terms our operating results would be negatively impacted in addition pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales reduced margins losses or the failure of our solution to maintain widespread market acceptance any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

we compete with firms that provide hcm solutions by various means many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software but as demand for greater flexibility and access to information grows we believe there will be increased competition in the delivery of hcm cloudbased solutions by other saas providers our competitors offer hcm solutions that may overlap with one several or all categories of applications and include companies such as automatic data processing inc ceridian hcm inc cornerstone ondemand inc oracle corporation paychex inc paylocity holding corporation paycor inc sap se the ultimate software group workday inc and other local and regional providers 

competition in the hcm solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness application quality and reputation breadth of service and product offering and price many of our competitors have established marketing relationships access to larger client bases and major distribution agreements with consultants software vendors and distributors in addition some competitors may offer software that addresses one or a limited number of hcm functions at a lower price point or with greater depth than our solution further some potential clients particularly large enterprises may elect to develop their own internal solutions if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected

the adoption of new or adverse interpretations of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes could subject us to additional regulation and related expenses and require changes to our business

the adoption of new money transmitter or money services business statutes in jurisdictions changes in regulators’ interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes or regulations or disagreements by regulatory authorities with our interpretation of such statutes or regulations could subject us to registration or licensing or limit business activities until we are appropriately licensed these occurrences could also require changes to the manner in which we conduct certain aspects of our business or invest client funds which could adversely impact the amount of interest income we receive from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities and accounts designated by our clients

while we maintain that we are not a money services business or money transmitter we have adopted an antimoney laundering “aml” compliance program to mitigate the risk of our application being used for illegal or illicit activity and to help detect and prevent fraud our aml compliance program is designed to foster trust in our application and services 

recently we were required to register as a “money services business” in one jurisdiction should other state or federal regulators make a determination that we have operated as an unlicensed money services business or money transmitter we could be subject to civil and criminal fines penalties costs of registration legal fees reputational damage or other negative consequences all of which may have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition

our financial results may fluctuate due to many factors some of which may be beyond our control

our results of operations including our revenues costs of revenues administrative expenses operating income cash flow and deferred revenue may vary significantly in the future and the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance fluctuations in our financial results may negatively impact the value of our common stock our financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control and as a result may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate from period to period include without limitation













 

 

























our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth and organizational change if we fail to manage such growth and change effectively we may be unable to execute our business plan maintain high levels of service or adequately address competitive challenges

we have experienced and may continue to experience rapid growth in our headcount and operations which has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management operational and financial resources we have also experienced significant growth in the number of clients and transactions and the amount of client and employee data that our infrastructure supports as a result our organizational structure and recording systems and procedures are becoming more complex as we improve our operational financial and management controls our success depends in part on our ability to manage this growth and organizational change effectively to manage the expected growth of our headcount and operations we must continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures the failure to effectively manage growth could result in declines in the quality of or client satisfaction with our applications increases in costs difficulties or delays in introducing new applications or other operational difficulties any of which could adversely affect our business by impairing our ability to retain and attract clients or sell additional applications to our existing clients 

further we need to continue to expand our sales force and support team members in order to grow our client base and increase our revenues but our ability to add additional offices may be constrained by the willingness and availability of qualified personnel to staff and manage any new offices and our success in recruiting and training sales personnel in those new offices if our expansion efforts are unsuccessful our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our deployment or technical support services or if our solution fails to perform properly

our business depends on our ability to satisfy our clients both with respect to our applications and the technical support provided to help our clients use the applications that address the needs of their businesses we use our inhouse deployment personnel to implement and configure our solution and provide support to our clients if a client is not satisfied with the quality of our solution the applications delivered or the support provided we could incur additional costs to address the situation our profitability might be negatively affected and the client’s dissatisfaction with our deployment or support service could harm our ability to sell additional applications to that client in addition our sales process is highly dependent on the reputation of our solution and applications and on positive recommendations from our existing clients our clients have no obligation to continue to use our applications and may choose not to continue to use our applications at the same or higher level of service if at all moreover our clients generally have the right to cancel their agreements with us for any or no reason by providing 30 days’ prior written notice in the past some of our clients have elected not to continue to use our applications any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality technical support could adversely affect client retention our reputation our ability to sell our applications to existing and prospective clients and as a result our business operating results or financial condition 

 

 

further our solution is inherently complex and may in the future contain or develop undetected defects or errors any defects in our applications could adversely affect our reputation impair our ability to sell our applications in the future and result in significant costs to us the costs incurred in correcting any application defects may be substantial and could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition any defects in functionality or defects that cause interruptions in the availability of our applications could result in 















because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our applications could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our clients regard as significant our clients might assert claims against us in the future alleging that they suffered damages due to a defect error or other failure of our solution our errors and omissions insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention any failures in the performance of our solution could harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients which would have an adverse impact on our business operating results or financial condition

the market for our solution among large companies may be limited if these companies demand customized features and functions that we do not offer

prospective clients especially larger companies may require customized features and functions unique to their business processes that we do not offer in order to ensure we meet these requirements we may devote a significant amount of support and service resources to larger prospective clients increasing the cost and time required to complete sales with no guarantee that these prospective clients will adopt our solution further we may not be successful in implementing any customized features or functions if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we do not offer or that would be difficult for them to deploy themselves the market for our solution will be more limited and our business could be adversely affected

we are dependent on the continued service of our key executives and if we fail to retain such key executives our business could be adversely affected

we believe that our success depends in part on the continued services of our senior management team consisting of chad richison craig e boelte jeffrey d york jon evans and bradley s smith our business could be adversely affected if we fail to retain these key executives although the employment arrangements of certain of our key executives contain noncompetition restrictions our business could nonetheless be adversely affected if a key executive leaves paycom and attempts to compete with us in addition we have not purchased key person life insurance on any members of our senior management team 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel including software developers and skilled it sales marketing and operational personnel our ability to develop and market new and existing products and in turn increase our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected

our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new applications as a result we are heavily dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified software developers and it personnel with the requisite education background and industry experience in addition to continue to execute our growth strategy we must also attract and retain qualified sales marketing and operational personnel capable of supporting a larger and more diverse client base the software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors this competition for qualified personnel may be amplified by new immigration laws or policies that could limit software companies’ ability to recruit internationally although such changes in immigration laws or policies would not have a significant direct impact on our workforce the ensuing increase in demand for software developers and it personnel could impair our ability to attract or retain skilled employees andor significantly increase our costs to do so furthermore identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use of our applications requires significant time expense and attention and it can take a substantial amount of time before our employees are fully trained and productive the loss of the services of a significant number of employees could be disruptive to our development 

 

 

efforts which may adversely affect our business by causing us to lose clients increase operating expenses or divert management’s attention to recruit replacements for the departed employees 

the failure to develop and maintain our brand costeffectively could have an adverse effect on our business

we believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a costeffective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our solution and is an important element in attracting new clients and retaining existing clients successful promotion of our brand depends largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful applications at competitive prices brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues and even if they do any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brand if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand we may fail to attract enough new clients or retain our existing clients to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding efforts which could have an adverse effect on our business

certain of our operating results and financial metrics may be difficult to predict as a result of seasonality

we have historically experienced seasonality in our revenues because a significant portion of our recurring revenues relate to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 and the annual processing and filing of acarelated forms because these forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year first quarter revenues are generally higher than revenues in subsequent quarters in addition unscheduled payroll runs at the end of the year such as bonuses often result in increased revenues in the fourth quarter we expect this seasonality to continue in the future although the repeal or modification of the aca could have an impact on the seasonality of our revenues seasonal fluctuations in certain of our operating results and financial metrics may make such results and metrics difficult to predict

the modification or repeal of certain provisions of the aca could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we generate acarelated revenues i on an annual basis in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients and ii from clients who have purchased our enhanced aca application as part of the fixed bundled price charged per billing period on january 20 2017 president donald j trump issued an executive order stating that it is the policy of the new administration to seek the prompt repeal of the aca despite multiple efforts congress was unable to pass legislation significantly repealing or replacing the aca in 2017 but many uncertainties remain regarding its future the trump administration took additional action in october 2017 that may weaken the aca’s public health insurance marketplace and the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 enacted december 22 2017 eliminated the aca’s individual mandate penalty beginning january 1 2019 both events suggest additional action to further weaken repeal or replace the aca may occur the modification or repeal of certain provisions of the aca could harm our business operating results and financial condition if the aca is modified to eliminate the employer reporting requirements or if the aca is repealed and replaced with new legislation that does not include similar employer reporting requirements we will no longer generate revenues in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients while we generally do not track our revenues on an applicationbyapplication basis because applications are often sold in various groupings and configurations for a single price we estimate that if the aca is not modified or repealed revenues from our enhanced aca application and aca forms filings business will represent approximately 4 of total projected revenues for the year ending december 31 2020 further uncertainty regarding the potential future modification repeal or replacement of the aca could adversely affect our ability to sell our enhanced aca application to new clients

if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights our competitive advantage could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets generate reduced revenues or incur costly litigation to protect our rights

our success is dependent in part upon our intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and to protect our intellectual property rights however the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our applications and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products or services that compete with ours

we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property we have been involved in litigation in the past and litigation may be necessary in the future to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets such litigation could be costly timeconsuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights we may not be able to secure protect and enforce our intellectual property rights or control access to and the distribution of our solution and proprietary information which could adversely affect our business

 

 

we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 

considerable intellectual property development activity exists in our industry and we expect that software developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of applications and competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps our competitors as well as a number of other entities and individuals may own or claim to own intellectual property in technology areas relating to our solution or applications in addition we may increasingly be subject to trademark infringement claims as our presence grows in the marketplace from time to time third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights a claim of infringement may also be made relating to technology that we acquire or license from third parties however we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover or may be alleged to cover some or all of our solution applications or brands

the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable and as a result any future litigation or claim of infringement could i cause us to enter into an unfavorable royalty or license agreement pay ongoing royalties or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms ii require us to discontinue the sale of our solution or applications iii require us to indemnify our clients or thirdparty service providers or iv require us to expend additional development resources to redesign our solution or applications any of these outcomes could harm our business even if we were to prevail any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business and operations

the use of open source software in our applications may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property rights

some of our applications use software covered by open source licenses from time to time there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate such software into their products or applications as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software litigation could be costly for us to defend have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional development resources to change our applications in addition if we were to combine our applications with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain of the open source licenses be required to release the source code of our applications if we inappropriately use open source software we may be required to redesign our applications discontinue the sale of our applications or take other remedial actions which could adversely impact our business operating results or financial condition

we employ thirdparty licensed software for use in our applications and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs or reduced service levels which could adversely affect our business

our applications incorporate certain thirdparty software obtained under licenses from other companies we anticipate that we will continue to rely on such thirdparty software and development tools from third parties in the future although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the thirdparty software we currently license this may not always be the case or it may be difficult or costly to replace in addition incorporating the software used in our applications with new thirdparty software may require significant work and substantial investment of our time and resources also to the extent that our applications depend upon the successful operation of thirdparty software in conjunction with our software any undetected errors or defects in this thirdparty software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our applications delay new application introductions result in a failure of our applications and harm our reputation

adverse economic and market conditions could affect our business operating results or financial condition

our business depends on the overall demand for hcm applications and on the economic health of our current and prospective clients if economic conditions in the united states or in global markets deteriorate clients may cease their operations eliminate or reduce unscheduled payroll runs such as bonuses reduce headcount delay or reduce their spending on hcm and other outsourcing services or attempt to renegotiate their contracts with us an economic decline could result in reductions in sales of our applications decreased revenue from unscheduled payroll runs and fees charged on a peremployee basis longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition in addition hcm spending levels may not increase following any recovery

in recent years there have been several instances when there has been uncertainty regarding the ability of congress and the president collectively to reach agreement on federal budgetary and spending matters a period of failure to reach agreement on these matters particularly if accompanied by an actual or threatened government shutdown may have an adverse impact on the us economy additionally because certain of our clients rely on government resources to fund their operations a prolonged government shutdown may affect such clients’ ability to make timely payments to us which could adversely affect our operations results or financial condition

 

 

further as part of our payroll and tax filing application we collect and then remit client funds to taxing authorities and accounts designated by our clients during the interval between receipt and disbursement we may invest such funds in money market funds demand deposit accounts certificates of deposit and commercial paper these investments are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks and such risks may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility any loss of or inability to access such funds could have an adverse impact on our cash position and results of operations and could require us to obtain additional sources of liquidity which may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us if at all 

our outstanding indebtedness is subject to certain operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities and may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business

we have incurred indebtedness to fund certain construction projects at our corporate headquarters pursuant to the terms of our outstanding indebtedness we may not subject to certain exceptions



















in addition we are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” to fixed charges defined as current maturities of longterm debt interest expense rent expense and distributions of not less than 125 to 10 and a funded indebtedness defined as total indebtedness less accounts payable accrued expenses and deferred revenues to ebitda of not greater than 20 to 10 the operating and financial covenants in the loan agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into may restrict our ability to finance our operations engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies we may also be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on our debt which would reduce the amount of money available for operations working capital expansion or other general corporate purposes

our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations and comply with the operating and financial covenants may be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to control many of these factors and comply with these covenants a breach of any of the covenants under our loan agreements could result in an event of default which could cause all of our outstanding indebtedness to become immediately due and payable

we may acquire other businesses applications or technologies which could divert our management’s attention result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results

in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses applications or technologies that we believe complement or expand our applications enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities the pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur expenses in identifying investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions whether or not they are ultimately consummated

we do not have any experience in acquiring other businesses if we acquire additional businesses we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel operations and technologies successfully or to effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition we also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors including









 

 















in addition a significant portion of the purchase price of any companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets which must be assessed for impairment at least annually in the future if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process which could harm our results of operations acquisitions could also result in issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt which would result in dilution to our stockholders

our business depends in part on the success of our relationships with third parties

we rely on thirdparty couriers financial and accounting processing systems and various financial institutions to deliver payroll checks and tax forms perform financial services in connection with our applications such as providing automated clearing house “ach” and wire transfers as part of our payroll and tax payment services and to provide technology and content support manufacture time clocks and process background checks we anticipate that we will continue to depend on various thirdparty relationships in order to grow our business provide technology and content support manufacture time clocks process background checks and deliver payroll checks and tax forms identifying negotiating and documenting relationships with these third parties and integrating thirdparty content and technology requires significant time and resources our agreements with third parties typically are nonexclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors in addition these third parties may not perform as expected under our agreements and we may have disagreements or disputes with such third parties which could negatively affect our brand and reputation a global economic slowdown could also adversely affect the businesses of our thirdparty providers hindering their ability to provide the services on which we rely further a disruption of the federal reserve bank’s services including ach processing could negatively affect our payroll and expense reimbursement services by delaying direct deposits and other financial transactions across the united states if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected even if we are successful these relationships may not result in improved operating results

if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings

we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as of december 31 2019 we had recorded a total of 519 million of goodwill and 05 million of other intangible assets an adverse change in domestic or global market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of our critical assumptions or estimates made in connection with the impairment testing of goodwill or intangible assets could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge to our goodwill or other intangible assets any such material charges may have a negative impact on our operating results or financial condition

we may pay employees and taxing authorities amounts due for a payroll period before a client’s electronic funds transfers are finally settled to our account if client payments are rejected by banking institutions or otherwise fail to clear into our accounts we may require additional sources of shortterm liquidity and our operating results could be adversely affected

our payroll processing application moves significant funds from the account of a client to employees and relevant taxing authorities for larger funding amounts we require clients to transfer the funds to us via fed wire for smaller funding amounts we debit a client’s account prior to any disbursement on its behalf and due to ach banking regulations funds previously credited could be reversed under certain circumstances and time frames after our payment of amounts due to employees and taxing and other regulatory authorities there is therefore a risk that the employer’s funds will be insufficient to cover the amounts we have already paid on its behalf while such shortage and accompanying financial exposure has only occurred in very limited circumstances in the past should clients default on their payment obligations in the future we might be required to advance substantial funds to cover such obligations in such an event we may be required to seek additional sources of shortterm liquidity which may not be available on reasonable terms if at all and our operating results and our liquidity could be adversely affected and our banking relationships could be harmed

 

 

because our longterm success may depend in part on our ability to expand the sales of our solution to clients located outside of the united states our business could be subject to risks associated with international operations 

an element of our growth strategy is to expand our operations and client base to date we have not engaged in any operations outside of the united states if we decide to expand our operations into international markets it will require significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory economic and political risks that are different from those in the united states because of our lack of experience with international operations we cannot ensure that our international expansion efforts will be successful and the impact of such expansion efforts may adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected

as a public company we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements management must evaluate and furnish a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and our auditors must attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting

if we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports andor we could become subject to investigations by the new york stock exchange the “nyse” the sec or other regulatory authorities and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected

adverse tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our clients which could increase the costs of our solution and applications and could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

as a vendor of services we are ordinarily held responsible by taxing authorities for collecting and paying any applicable sales or other similar taxes additionally the application of federal state and local tax laws to services provided electronically like ours is evolving new income sales use or other tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time possibly with retroactive effect and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services and applications provided over the internet these enactments could adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and ultimately could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that change over time we review these rules and regulations periodically and when we believe we are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state we may voluntarily engage state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with that state’s rules and regulations we cannot ensure that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we currently believe no such taxes are required 

in addition existing tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be interpreted changed modified or applied adversely to us possibly with retroactive effect which could require us or our clients to pay additional tax amounts as well as require us or our clients to pay fines or penalties and substantial interest for past amounts if we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our clients we could be held liable for such costs thereby adversely affecting our business operating results or financial condition additionally the imposition of such taxes on us would effectively increase the cost of our software and services we provide to clients and would likely have a negative impact on our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the jurisdictions in which such taxes are imposed

our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance

we have released and may continue to release guidance in our earnings conference calls earnings releases or otherwise regarding our future performance which represents our estimates as of the date of release this guidance which includes forwardlooking statements has been and will be based on projections prepared by our management these projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections accordingly no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections

projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that while presented with numerical specificity are inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control projections are also based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions some of which will change the principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any third parties

 

 

guidance is necessarily speculative in nature and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will vary significantly from actual results accordingly our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material in light of the foregoing investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock 

any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this “risk factors” section in this form 10k could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance and the differences may be adverse and material

the issuance of additional stock in connection with acquisitions our stock incentive plans warrants or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to one hundred million shares of common stock and up to ten million shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations we may issue all of these shares that are not already outstanding without any action or approval by our stockholders we intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions in the future we may pay for such acquisitions in part or in full through the issuance of additional equity securities

any issuance of shares in connection with an acquisition the exercise of stock options or warrants the award of shares of restricted stock or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by our existing stockholders

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management

any provision of our certificate of incorporation bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

generally accepted accounting principles in the united states are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change

our certificate of incorporation contains an exclusive forum provision that may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers

our certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if no court of chancery located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or other employees to us or our stockholders any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of delaware law or our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws as either may be amended from time to time or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in addition this exclusive forum selection provision will not apply to claims under the exchange act moreover section 22 of the securities act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the securities act or the rules and regulations thereunder accordingly there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce our forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the securities act this forum selection provision may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us it is also possible that notwithstanding the forum selection clause included in our certificate of incorporation a court could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this “form 10k” the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties see part i “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” for a discussion of the uncertainties risks and assumptions associated with those statements actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in the section entitled “risk factors” unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires the terms “we” “us” “our” and the “company” refer to paycom software inc and its consolidated subsidiaries all amounts presented in tables other than per share amounts are in thousands unless otherwise noted

overview 

we are a leading provider of comprehensive cloudbased human capital management “hcm” software delivered as softwareasaservice we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment lifecycle from recruitment to retirement our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions including talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and human resources management applications our userfriendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees enabling selfmanagement of their hcm activities in the cloud which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity

we generate revenues from i fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed and ii fixed amounts charged per billing period we do not require clients to enter into longterm contractual commitments with us our billing period varies by client based on when each client pays its employees which may be weekly biweekly semimonthly or monthly our revenues are primarily generated through our sales force that solicits new clients and our client relations representatives who sell new applications to existing clients

our continued growth depends on attracting new clients through further penetration of our existing markets and geographic expansion into new markets targeting a high degree of client employee usage across our solution and introducing new applications to our existing client base we believe our ability to continue to develop new applications and to improve existing applications will enable us to increase revenues in the future and the number of our new applications adopted by our clients has been a significant factor in our revenue growth 

throughout our history we have built strong relationships with our clients as the hcm needs of our clients evolve we believe that we are wellpositioned to expand the hcm spending of our clients and we believe this opportunity is significant to be successful we must continue to demonstrate the operational and economic benefits of our solution as well as effectively hire train motivate and retain qualified personnel

growth outlook opportunities and challenges

as a result of our significant growth and geographic expansion we are presented with a variety of opportunities and challenges our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications consequently we have historically generated the majority of our revenues from our payroll applications although our revenue mix has evolved and will continue to evolve as we develop and add new nonpayroll applications to our solution we believe our strategy of focusing on increased employee usage is key to longterm client satisfaction and client retention client adoption of new applications and client employee usage of both new and existing applications have been significant factors in our revenue growth and we expect the continuation of this trajectory will depend in part on the introduction of applications to our existing client base that encourage and promote more employee usage moreover in order to increase revenues and continue to improve our operating results we must also attract new clients we intend to obtain new clients by i continuing to leverage our salesforce productivity within markets where we currently have existing sales offices ii expanding our presence in metropolitan areas where we currently have an existing sales office through adding sales teams or offices thereby increasing the number of sales professionals within such markets and iii opening sales offices in new metropolitan areas 

our target client size range is 50 to 5000 employees while we continue to serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one employee to many thousands of employees the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations increased the number of applications we offer and experienced traction with larger companies our solution requires no adjustment to serve larger clients we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of potential clients and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost to us because we charge our clients on a per employee basis for certain services we provide any increase or decrease in the number of employees at our clients will have a positive 

 

 

or negative impact respectively on our results of operations we expect the changes in certain factors affecting our performance will correlate with improvement or deterioration in the labor market 

based on our total revenues we have grown at a 35 compound annual growth rate from january 1 2016 through december 31 2019 growing our business has resulted in and will continue to result in substantial investments in sales professionals operating expenses system development and programming costs and general and administrative expenses which have and will continue to increase our expenses specifically our revenue growth and geographic expansion drive increases in our employee headcount which in turn precipitates an increase in i salaries and benefits ii stockbased compensation expense and iii facility costs related to the expansion of our corporate headquarters operations facilities and additional sales office leases

we believe the challenges of managing the everchanging complexity of payroll and human resources will continue to drive companies to turn to outsourced providers for help with their hcm needs the hcm industry historically has been driven in part by legislation and regulatory action including cobra changes to the minimum wage laws or overtime rules and legislation from federal state or municipal taxation authorities the implementation of the affordable care act the “aca” is an example of legislation that has created demand in the hcm industry we generate acarelated revenues i on an annual basis in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients and ii from clients who have purchased our enhanced aca application as part of the fixed bundled price charged per billing period while we generally do not track our revenues on an applicationbyapplication basis because applications are often sold in various groupings and configurations for a single price we estimate that if the aca is not modified or repealed revenues from our enhanced aca application and aca forms filings business will represent approximately 4 of total projected revenues for the year ending december 31 2020

for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 our gross margins were approximately 85 84 and 83 respectively although our gross margins may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonality and hiring trends we expect our gross margins will remain relatively consistent in future periods

key metrics

in addition to the us gaap and nongaap metrics discussed elsewhere in this form 10k we also monitor the following metrics to evaluate our business measure our performance and identify trends affecting our business 

 



 









 

 

components of results of operations 

sources of revenues 

revenues are comprised of recurring revenues and implementation and other revenues we expect our revenues to increase as we introduce new applications expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients as a percentage of total revenues we expect our mix of recurring revenues and implementation and other revenues to remain relatively constant

recurring revenues 

recurring revenues include fees for our talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for form filings and delivery of client payroll checks and reports these revenues are derived from i fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed or ii fixed amounts charged per billing period we do not require clients to enter into longterm contractual commitments with us our billing period varies by client based on when each client pays its employees which may be weekly biweekly semimonthly or monthly because recurring revenues are based in part on fees for use of our applications and the delivery of checks and reports that are levied on a peremployee basis our recurring revenues increase as our clients hire more employees recurring revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered 

recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs such as bonuses for our clients because payroll forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year and many of our clients are subject to aca form filing requirements in the first quarter first quarter revenues and margins are generally higher than in subsequent quarters we anticipate our revenues will continue to exhibit this seasonal pattern related to aca form filings for so long as the aca or replacement legislation includes employer reporting requirements in addition we often experience increased revenues during the fourth quarter due to unscheduled payroll runs for our clients that occur before the end of the year therefore we expect the seasonality of our revenue cycle to decrease to the extent clients utilize more of our nonpayroll applications

recurring revenues also include interest earned on funds held for clients we collect funds from clients in advance of either the applicable due date for payroll tax submissions or the applicable disbursement date for employee payment services these collections from clients are typically disbursed from one to 30 days after receipt with some funds being held for up to 120 days we typically invest funds held for clients in money market funds demand deposit accounts commercial paper and certificates of deposit until they are paid to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees we expect interest earned on funds held for clients will increase as we introduce new applications expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients the amount of interest we earn from the investment of client funds is also impacted by changes in interest rates 

implementation and other revenues

results of operations

the following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of income data and such data as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods indicated as well as yearoveryear changes with respect to each line item refer to the annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 filed with the sec on february 14 2019 for a discussion of results for the year ended december 31 2017 

 



 

 

revenues 

the increase in total revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 from the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily the result of i the addition of new clients and productivity and efficiency gains in mature sales offices which are offices that have been open for at least 24 months ii higher average interest rates earned on funds held for clients iii the strong performance of our tax forms filing business iv the sale of additional applications to our existing clients v contributions from new sales offices that were progressing toward maturity or reached maturity during 2019 and vi the modest price increase implemented for a portion of our clients in march 2019 

the increase in implementation and other revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 from the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily the result of the increased recognition of nonrefundable conversion fees that are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client setup these fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the tenyear estimated life of our clients

expenses

cost of revenues

during the year ended december 31 2019 operating expenses increased from the prior year by 131 million primarily due to a 71 million increase in expenses attributable to growth in the number of operating personnel as well as a 46 million increase in shipping fees and a 14 million increase in automated clearing house fees both of which related to the increase in revenues additionally depreciation and amortization expense increased 59 million or 40 primarily due to the development of additional technology and purchases of other related fixed assets 

administrative expenses

sales and marketing

during the year ended december 31 2019 sales and marketing expenses increased from the prior year by 354 million due to a 256 million increase in employeerelated expenses including commissions bonuses and noncash stockbased compensation and a 98 million increase in marketing and advertising expense the increase in employeerelated expenses included a 04 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense

research and development

during the year ended december 31 2019 research and development expenses increased from the prior year due to a 268 million increase in employeerelated expenses including a 24 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense

as we continue the ongoing development of our platform and product offerings we generally expect research and development expenses exclusive of stockbased compensation to continue to increase particularly as we hire more personnel to support our growth while we expect this trend to continue on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of total revenues we also anticipate the rate of increase to decline over time as we leverage our growth and realize additional economies of scale as is customary for our business we also expect fluctuations in research and development expense as a percentage of revenue on a quartertoquarter basis due to seasonal revenue trends the introduction of new products the amount and timing of research and development costs that may be capitalized and the timing of onboarding new hires and restricted stock vesting events

expenditures for software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a threeyear period on a straightline basis the nature of the development projects underway during a particular period directly impacts the timing and extent of these capitalized expenditures and can affect the amount of research and development expenses in such period the table below sets forth the amounts of capitalized and expensed research and development costs for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018

 



 

general and administrative

during the year ended december 31 2019 general and administrative expenses increased by 309 million from the prior year due to a 213 million increase in employeerelated expenses which included a 77 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense and a 96 million increase in accounting and legal expenses related to regulatory and compliance matters

 

 

noncash stockbased compensation expense 



 

during the year ended december 31 2019 our noncash stockbased compensation expense increased 109 million from the prior year primarily due to the issuance and subsequent accelerated vesting of restricted stock subject to marketbased vesting conditions during the first quarter of 2019 which exceeded expenses associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock subject to marketbased vesting conditions in 2018

depreciation and amortization

during the year ended december 31 2019 depreciation and amortization expense increased from the prior year primarily due to the development of additional technology and purchases of other related fixed assets

interest expense

the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2019 was due to the timing of construction of our expanded operations facility and our fourth headquarters building which resulted in less capitalized interest in 2019 

other income net

the decrease in other income net for the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swap as compared to the year ended december 31 2018

provision for income taxes

the provision for income taxes is based on a current estimate of the annual effective income tax rate adjusted to reflect the impact of discrete items our effective income tax rate was 20 and 22 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the lower effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily resulted from an increase in excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation related to vesting events which was partially offset by changes in tax legislation that increased nondeductible expenses

liquidity and capital resources

our principal sources of capital and liquidity are our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents are comprised primarily of demand deposit accounts money market funds and certificates of deposit additionally we maintain a senior secured revolving credit facility the “facility” which can be accessed as needed to supplement our operating cash flow and cash balances the facility provides us the ability to borrow funds in the aggregate principal amount of 750 million which may be increased up to 1250 million subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying certain other conditions we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months 

we have historically funded our operations from cash flows generated from operations cash from the sale of equity securities and debt financing although we have funded most of the costs for construction projects at our corporate headquarters and other facilities from available cash we have incurred indebtedness for a portion of these costs further all purchases under our stock repurchase plans were paid for from available cash 

term credit agreement as of december 31 2019 our indebtedness consisted solely of term loans the “term loans” made under a senior secured term credit agreement as amended from time to time the “term credit agreement” among the company certain of our subsidiaries jpmorgan chase bank na bank of america na and kirkpatrick bank our obligations under the term loans are secured by a mortgage and first priority security interest in our headquarters property the term loans mature on september 7 2025 and bear interest at our option at either a a prime rate plus 10 or b an adjusted libor rate for the interest period in effect for such term loan plus 15 

 

 

under the term credit agreement we are required to comply with certain financial and nonfinancial covenants including maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 125 to 10 and a funded indebtedness to ebitda ratio of not greater than 20 to 10 additionally the term credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including covenants limiting our ability to among other things grant liens incur debt effect certain mergers make investments dispose of assets enter into certain transactions including swap agreements and sale and leaseback transactions pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock and enter into transactions with affiliates in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit agreement of this size and type as of december 31 2019 we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in the term credit agreement 

interest rate swap agreement in connection with entering into the term credit agreement we also entered into a floatingtofixed interest rate swap agreement to limit the exposure to interest rate risk related to the term loans the “interest rate swap agreement” the interest rate swap agreement which has a maturity date of september 7 2025 provides that we will receive quarterly variable interest payments based on the libor rate and will pay interest at a fixed rate we have elected not to designate this interest rate swap as a hedge and as such changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 we recognized a loss of 14 million and a gain of 07 million respectively for the change in fair value of the interest rate swap which is included in other income net in the consolidated statements of income 

revolving credit agreement on february 12 2018 we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement the “revolving credit agreement” with jpmorgan chase bank na and bank of america na that provided for the facility in the aggregate principal amount of 500 million the “revolving commitment” which could be increased to up to 1000 million subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying certain other conditions the facility includes a 50 million sublimit for swingline loans and a 25 million sublimit for letters of credit the facility was scheduled to mature on february 12 2020 on april 15 2019 we entered into the first amendment to revolving credit agreement the “first amendment” pursuant to first amendment wells fargo bank na was added as a lender and the revolving commitment was increased to 750 million which may be further increased to 1250 million subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying other conditions and the scheduled maturity date of the facility was extended to april 15 2022 

borrowings under the facility will generally bear interest at a prime rate plus 10 or at our option an adjusted libor rate for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus 15 in each case subject to certain conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreement as of december 31 2019 we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the facility

stock repurchase plan and withholding shares to cover taxes in may 2016 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan allowing for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in open market transactions at prevailing market prices in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws including rule 10b51 programs since the initial authorization of the stock repurchase plan our board of directors has amended and extended the stock repurchase plan from time to time most recently on november 20 2018 we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 1500 million of our common stock our stock repurchase plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time the actual timing number and value of shares repurchased depends on a number of factors including the market price of our common stock general market and economic conditions the shares withheld for taxes associated with the vesting of restricted stock and other corporate considerations 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we withheld 219764 shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to the delivery of vested shares of restricted stock to certain employees our payment of the taxes on behalf of those employees resulted in a cash expenditure of 425 million and as such we generally subtract the amounts attributable to such withheld shares from the aggregate amount available for future purchases under our stock repurchase plan as of december 31 2019 there was 1194 million available for repurchases the stock repurchase plan will expire on november 19 2020 

cash flow analysis

our cash flows from operating activities have historically been significantly impacted by profitability implementation revenues received but deferred our investment in sales and marketing to drive growth and research and development our ability to meet future liquidity needs will be driven by our operating performance and the extent of continued investment in our operations failure to generate sufficient revenues and related cash flows could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our liquidity needs and achieve our business objectives

as our business grows we expect our capital expenditures and our investment activity to continue to increase we are currently focused on the ongoing construction of our new texas operations facility in grapevine texas capital expenditures related to the construction of the facility began in the second quarter of 2019 on august 5 2019 we purchased 1075 acres of land adjacent to our corporate headquarters in oklahoma city for 192 million while there are no immediate plans for development we expect a portion of this land will be utilized to facilitate our growth in the future depending on certain growth opportunities we may choose to accelerate investments in sales and marketing acquisitions technology and services actual future capital requirements will depend 

 

 

on many factors including our future revenues cash from operating activities and the level of expenditures in all areas of our business 

as part of our payroll and payroll tax filing services we collect funds from our clients for federal state and local employment taxes which we remit to the appropriate tax agencies we invest these funds in money market funds demand deposit accounts commercial paper and certificates of deposit from which we earn interest income during the period between their receipt and disbursement

our cash flows from investing and financing activities are influenced by the amount of funds held for clients which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter the balance of the funds we hold depends on our clients’ payroll calendars and therefore such balance changes from period to period in accordance with the timing of each payroll cycle 

our cash flows from financing activities are also affected by the extent to which we use available cash to purchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase plan as well as restricted stock vesting events that result in net share settlements and the company paying withholding taxes on behalf of certain employees

the following table summarizes the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018

 



1 amounts have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of accounting standards update no 201618 “statement of cash flows topic 230 restricted cash a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force” see note 2 for a summary of reclassifications and adjustments

operating activities

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily consisted of payments received from our clients and interest earned on funds held for clients cash used in operating activities primarily consisted of personnelrelated expenditures to support the growth and infrastructure of our business these payments included costs of operations advertising and other sales and marketing efforts it infrastructure development product research and development and security and administrative costs compared to the year ended december 31 2018 our operating cash flows for the year ended december 31 2019 were positively impacted by the growth of our business

investing activities

cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2019 increased from the prior year period due to an 863 million decrease in proceeds from maturities of shortterm investments from funds held for clients a 508 million increase in purchases of shortterm investments from funds held for clients and a 330 million increase in cash used for purchases of property and equipment which was primarily related to the purchase of land adjacent to our corporate headquarters

financing activities

cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december 31 2019 decreased from the prior year period primarily due to the impact of 8164 million of changes in client funds obligation which is due to the timing of receipts from our clients and payments made to our clients’ employees and applicable taxing authorities on their behalf additionally cash flows from financing activities were positively impacted by a 1052 million decrease in repurchases of common stock these cash flows provided by financing activities were partially offset by a 223 million increase in withholding taxes paid related to net share settlements and a 09 million increase in payments on longterm debt

contractual obligations

our principal commitments primarily consist of longterm debt and leases for office space we disclose our longterm debt in note 6 and our commitments and contingencies in note 12 in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

 

 

as of december 31 2019 the future noncancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows 

 



 

we plan to continue to lease additional office space to support our growth in addition many of our existing lease agreements provide us with the option to renew when applicable our future operating lease obligations include payments due during any renewal period provided for in the lease where the lease imposes a penalty for failure to renew

the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum services to be used fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above

offbalance sheet arrangements

as of december 31 2019 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that may be material to investors

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results may materially differ from these estimates made by management under different assumptions and conditions

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are described below accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations

revenue recognition

revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to for those goods or services substantially all of our revenues are comprised of revenue from contracts with clients sales and other applicable taxes are excluded from revenues

recurring revenues are derived primarily from our talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for form ﬁlings and delivery of client payroll checks and reports talent acquisition includes our applicant tracking candidate tracker background check onboarding everify and tax credit services applications time and labor management includes time and attendance schedulingschedule exchange timeoff requests labor allocation labor management reportspush reporting and geofencinggeotracking payroll includes our payroll and tax management paycom pay expense management garnishment management and gl concierge applications talent management includes our employee selfservice compensation budgeting performance management executive dashboard and paycom learning and course content applications hr management includes our document and task management government and compliance beneﬁts administration cobra administration personnel action forms surveys and enhanced aca applications

the performance obligations related to recurring revenues are satisfied during each client’s payroll period with the agreedupon fee being charged and collected as part of our processing of the client’s payroll recurring revenues are recognized at the conclusion of processing of each client’s payroll period when each respective payroll client is billed collectability is reasonably assured as the fees are collected through an automated clearing house as part of the client’s payroll cycle or through direct wire transfer which minimizes the default risk 

the contract period for substantially all contracts associated with these revenues is one month due to the fact that both we and the client have the unilateral right to terminate a wholly unperformed contract without compensating the other party by providing 30 

 

 

days’ notice of termination our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications for clients who purchase multiple applications due to the shortterm nature of our contracts we do not believe it is meaningful to separately assess and identify whether or not each application potentially represents its own individual performance obligation as the revenue generated from each application is recognized within the same month as the revenue from the core payroll application similarly we do not believe it is meaningful to individually determine the standalone selling price for each application we consider the total price charged to a client in a given period to be indicative of the standalone selling price as the total amount charged is within a reasonable range of prices typically charged for our goods and services for comparable classes of client groups 

implementation and other revenues consist of nonrefundable upfront conversion fees which are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client setup as well as revenues from the sale of time clocks as part of our employee time and attendance services although these revenues are related to our recurring revenues they represent distinct performance obligations 

implementation activities primarily represent administrative activities that allow us to fulfill future performance obligations for our clients and do not represent services transferred to the client however the nonrefundable upfront fee charged to our clients results in an implied performance obligation in the form of a material right to the client related to the client’s option to renew at the end of each 30day contract period further given that all other services within the contract are sold at a total price indicative of the standalone selling price coupled with the fact that the upfront fees are consistent with upfront fees charged in similar contracts that we have with clients the standalone selling price of the client’s option to renew the contract approximates the dollar amount of the nonrefundable upfront fee the nonrefundable upfront fee is typically included on the client’s first invoice and is deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated renewal period ie tenyear estimated client life 

revenues from the sale of time clocks are recognized when control is transferred to the client upon delivery of the product we estimate the standalone selling price for the time clocks by maximizing the use of observable inputs such as our specific pricing practices for time clocks 

goodwill and other intangible assets

goodwill is not amortized but we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually or earlier if at the reporting unit level an indicator of impairment arises the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows if impairment exists a writedown to fair value is recorded our business is largely homogeneous and as a result goodwill is associated with one reporting unit we have selected june 30 as our annual goodwill impairment testing date we elected to perform a qualitative analysis of the fair value of our goodwill and determined there was no impairment as of june 30 2019 for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 there were no indicators of impairment intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives

impairment of longlived assets

longlived assets including intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset we have determined that there is no impairment of longlived assets for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017

marketbased restricted stock awards

we measure noncash stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock awards issued by using a monte carlo simulation model this model considers various subjective assumptions as inputs and represent our best estimates which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment as it relates to market volatilities the historical volatility of our stock price riskfree rates and expected life the valuation model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data determining these assumptions is subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our marketbased stock awards and the associated compensation expense refer to note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stockbased compensation awards

nongaap financial measures

management uses adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income as supplemental measures to review and assess the performance of our core business operations and for planning purposes we define i adjusted ebitda as net income plus interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization noncash stockbased compensation expense certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations if any and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap and ii nongaap net income as net income plus noncash stockbased compensation expense certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations if any and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap all of which are adjusted for the effect of income taxes adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income are metrics that provide investors with greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking we believe these metrics are useful to investors because they facilitate comparisons of our core business operations across periods on a consistent basis as well as comparisons with the results of peer companies many of which use similar nongaap financial measures to supplement results under us gaap in addition adjusted ebitda is a measure that provides useful information to management about the amount of cash available for reinvestment in our business repurchasing common stock and other purposes management believes that the nongaap measures presented in this form 10k when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with us gaap provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business and performance

adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income are not measures of financial performance under us gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income which we consider to be the most directly comparable us gaap measure adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing our operating performance you should not consider adjusted ebitda or nongaap net income in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other consolidated statements of income data prepared in accordance with us gaap adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income may not be comparable to similar titled measures of other companies and other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do 

 

 

the following tables reconcile net income to adjusted ebitda net income to nongaap net income and earnings per share to nongaap net income per share on a basic and diluted basis refer to our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 filed with the sec on february 14 2019  for a presentation of the 2017 amounts 



 



 



 



 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate sensitivity

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 1337 million as of december 31 2019 these amounts are invested primarily in demand deposit accounts and money market funds we consider all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less and secregistered money market mutual funds to be cash equivalents the primary objectives of our investing activities are capital preservation meeting our liquidity needs and with respect to investing client funds generating interest income while maintaining the safety of principal we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes

our cash equivalents are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates the market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates

as described elsewhere in this form 10k the term loans made under the term credit agreement bear interest at our option at either a a prime rate plus 10 or b an adjusted libor rate for the interest period in effect for such term loan plus 15 as a result we are exposed to increased interest rate risk to mitigate the increased interest rate risk we entered into the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate swap agreement has effectively fixed our interest rate at 40 eliminating a portion of the variable rate and coinciding interest rate risk associated with the term loans as of december 31 2019 an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points would not have had a material effect on our operating results or financial condition

as described elsewhere in this form 10k the revolving credit agreement as amended provides for a facility in the aggregate amount of 750 million which may be increased to up to 1250 million borrowings under the facility will generally bear interest at a prime rate plus 10 or at our option an adjusted libor rate for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus 15 as of december 31 2019 we have not made any draws under the facility to the extent we make draws under the facility in the future we may be exposed to increased interest rate risk

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure we believe however that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error within a company if any have been detected

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

business

unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires the terms “paycom” “we” “us” “our” and the “company” refer to paycom software inc a delaware corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 

overview

we are a leading provider of comprehensive cloudbased human capital management “hcm” solution delivered as softwareasaservice “saas” we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment lifecycle from recruitment to retirement our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions including talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and human resources “hr” management applications our userfriendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees enabling selfmanagement of their hcm activities in the cloud which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity

organizations need sophisticated flexible and intuitive applications that can quickly adapt to their evolving hcm requirements streamline their hr processes and systems and enable them to control costs we believe the hcm needs of most organizations are currently served either by multiple providers in an attempt to replicate a comprehensive saas product or to a lesser extent by legacy providers offering outdated onpremise products these approaches often result in challenges with system integration and data integrity low scalability high costs extended delivery times and large upfront capital requirements

because our solution was developed inhouse and is based on a single platform there is no need to integrate update or access multiple databases which are common issues with competitor offerings that use multiple thirdparty systems in order to link together their hcm offerings additionally our solution maintains data integrity for accurate actionable and realtime analytics and business intelligence and helps clients minimize the risks of compliance errors due to inaccurate or missing information we deliver featurerich applications while maintaining excellence in information security and quality management standards as evidenced by our international organization for standardization “iso” certifications 

we sell our solution directly through our internally trained clientfocused and highly skilled sales force based in offices across the united states as a part of our client retention effort a specialist within a dedicated team is assigned to each client to provide industryleading personalized service we have over 23500 clients none of which constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2018 we believe that as a result of our focus on client retention we enjoy high client satisfaction as evidenced by an annual revenue retention rate of 92 91 and 91 from existing clients for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively we believe our revenue retention rate understates our client loyalty because this rate is decreased by former clients that were acquired or otherwise ceased operations

we were founded in 1998 since our founding we have focused on providing an innovative saas hcm solution as of december 31 2018 we had 3050 employees across the united states for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 our 

 

 

revenues were 5663 million 4330 million and 3291 million respectively representing yearover year growth in revenues of approximately 31 and 32 respectively we currently derive the majority of our revenues from payroll processing we are able to determine revenues from payroll processing because all of our clients are required to utilize our p ayroll application in order to access our other applications we generally do not separately track our revenues across our other applications because we often sell applications in various groupings and configurations for a single price we realized net inc ome of 1371 million 1235 million and 704 million for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

the paycom solution

comprehensive hcm solution

our solution offers functionality that manages the entire employment lifecycle for employers and employees from recruitment to retirement our userfriendly applications streamline client processes and provide clients and their employees with the ability to directly access and manage administrative processes including applications that identify candidates onboard employees manage time and labor administer payroll deductions and benefits manage performance terminate employees and administer posttermination health benefits such as cobra the widespread employee usage of our applications further integrates our solution into the administrative processes of our clients our solution also has the advantage of being built inhouse by our highly trained and skilled team of software developers thereby minimizing data integrity issues across applications

core system of record

our solution is based on a core system of record that contains payroll and hr information in one convenient database thereby reducing costs and eliminating the need for multiple software products and vendors and the maintenance of employee data in numerous databases this core system of record enables our clients to input employee data one time and enjoy seamless functionality across our applications when a revision is made to the file of an employee all appropriate personnel have access to the change in real time in addition our core system of record helps clients minimize the risk of compliance errors due to inaccurate or missing information that results from maintaining multiple databases through accurate tracking and management of employee payroll and other hr data such information can be compiled for comprehensive and consistent reporting for our clients

data analytics and business intelligence

our solution’s core system of record allows clients to strategically analyze comprehensive and accurate employee information to make informed business decisions based upon actionable realtime analytics provided through our client dashboard this functionality allows our clients to operate with a more complete and accurate picture of their organization as our solution’s embedded analytics capture the content and context of everyday business events facilitating fast and informed decisionmaking from any location these tools help clients reduce administrative and operational costs and better manage talent

enhanced employee experience 

the employees of our clients also benefit from our hcm applications as workforces transition from technologysavvy to technologydependent employees expect mobile technology and the resources necessary to readily access information and control their professional development through our employee selfservice technology employees can view realtime hr information including pay stubs w2s and benefits information as well as manage their schedules and vacation time and update w4 contact information our mobile apps available on both the google play™ store and the app store® online store make it easier for employees to access their selfservice information our apps have fingerprint and facial recognition capabilities aiding employers in their efforts to engage technologydependent workers our system also allows employers to engage their workforce through learning management courses and training paths surveys and performance goals and reviews

in addition to our selfservice appbased functionality we also provide our clients with a strategy to drive usage among their employees this strategy includes training clients’ employees how to use the paycom app during implementation and providing additional training from our client relations representatives allowing employees to make changes directly to our database creates efficiencies for both the employer and employee today’s employees have little tolerance for complexity and with our solution employees have become accustomed to having a direct relationship with their hr database this relationship is directly correlated with our singledatabase that is key to increasing usage our strategy to promote employee usage of the paycom system elevates hr personnel to focus on the human element of their jobs creating a more positive culture and giving hr personnel more time to engage with their employees

personalized support provided by trained personnel

our applications are supported by oneonone personal assistance from trained specialists service specialists are assigned to specific clients and are trained across all of our applications ensuring they provide comprehensive expertlevel service our client 

 

 

service is iso 90012015 certified on the basis of its quality and consistency we strive to provide our clients with high levels of service and support to ensure their continued use of our solution for all of their hcm needs we have maintained high client satisfaction as evidenced by an annual revenue retention rate of 92 91 and 91 from existing clients for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

softwareasaservice delivery model

our saas delivery model allows clients with geographically dispersed and mobile workforces to operate more efficiently and allows these clients to implement access and use our clientoriented internet solution on demand and remotely through standard web browsers smart phones tablets and other webenabled devices our saas solution reduces the time risk headcount and costs associated with installing and maintaining applications for onpremise products within the information technology “it” infrastructure of our clients

secure cloudbased architecture

our cloudbased architecture allows our solution to be implemented remotely with minimal client interaction updates such as software enhancements and newly developed applications can be deployed without client interaction disruption or involvement allowing our clients to make a smaller investment in hardware personnel implementation time and consulting additionally we own and maintain all of the infrastructure technology to host our solution and to maximize system availability for clients our focus on and investment in technology and data security has been recognized with isoiec 270012013 certified security standards that provide our clients with a “bestinclass” level of data security

scalability to grow with our clients

our solution is highly scalable we serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one employee to many thousands of employees while our target client size range is 50 to 5000 employees we calculate the number of clients’ employees based on parent company grouping our clients are able to use the same solution while their businesses grow by deploying applications asneeded in realtime pricing is determined by employee headcount and the number of applications utilized enabling our clients to align hcm spending with their evolving hcm needs as compared to traditional hcm products that require clients to migrate to new software as they grow but retain fixed costs even if the client shrinks in size

efficient and productive research and development

we believe we benefit from a competitive advantage with our research and development investments people and processes early investments in our proprietary cloudbased architecture enable us to develop and deploy applications in a timely and costeffective manner we have also chosen to base our research and development team in oklahoma and texas which we believe provides us with highquality talent at a lower cost compared to other locations in the united states where there is more competition for technology talent these strategic decisions have enabled us to have a highly productive research and development function

our strategy for growth

our strategy is to continue to establish our solution as the hcm industry standard by increasing our presence in existing markets and expanding into additional markets we intend to continue to open new sales offices as well as potentially expand over the longer term into international markets we will also execute our strategy for growth by targeting larger clients as well as strengthening and extending our solution 

increase our presence in existing markets

we believe a significant market opportunity exists to increase our presence within markets where we currently have a sales office each sales office is typically staffed with one sales team with each team comprised of a sales manager and approximately six to eight other sales professionals although we have a sales office in 37 of the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas “msas” in the united states based on july 2017 us census bureau estimates only five of these msas are currently served by multiple paycom sales teams in addition to expanding into new markets we plan to further penetrate and more effectively capture existing markets by adding sales offices and increasing the number of sales teams in such markets since our initial public offering “ipo” in april 2014 we have expanded our presence within three msas that were already served by at least one paycom sales team by opening new sales offices in brooklyn chicago long island and pasadena 

expand into additional markets

we plan to continue expanding our sales capability by opening sales offices in certain metropolitan areas where we currently have no sales teams since our ipo in april 2014 we have expanded into 14 new markets 

we have historically selected new locations based on potential client and employee demographics as well as business density when opening a new sales office we typically relocate a proven sales manager from an existing territory who then recruits a team of highperforming sales representatives it typically takes a new sales office 24 months to reach maturity 

 

 

enlarge our existing client relationships 

we dedicate our resources to helping our clients facilitate their goals whether through helping them execute better hiring decisions manage compensation more effectively or simply operate more efficiently we believe a significant growth opportunity exists in selling additional applications to our current clients many clients have subsequently deployed additional applications as they recognize the benefits of our comprehensive solution as we extend and enhance the functionality of our solution we will continue to invest in initiatives to increase the adoption of our solution and maintain our high levels of client satisfaction

target larger clients

the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations and increased the number of applications we offer we serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one employee to many thousands of employees while our target client size is 50 to 5000 employees based on our total revenues we have grown at a 39 compound annual growth rate from january 1 2015 through december 31 2018 our solution requires no adjustment to serve larger clients we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost to us to further capitalize on this opportunity we intend to continue targeting larger businesses opportunistically where our current sales model is effective

maintain our leadership in innovation by strengthening and extending our solution

our ability to develop and deploy new applications and updates rapidly and costeffectively has been integral to the results that we have achieved to date we intend to continue extending the functionality and range of our solution in the future our development efforts are performed exclusively inhouse and are heavily based upon proactive research and client input we are focusing our investments on the development of new applications enhancements and learning courses that are responsive to the needs of our clients which are garnered through ongoing client interaction and collaboration

our applications 

our hcm solution offers a full suite of applications that generally fall within the following categories talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management

talent acquisition

our clients

we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry we have over 23500 clients or approximately 12700 clients based on parent company grouping none of which constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2018 we stored data for over 41 million persons employed by our clients during the year ended december 31 2018

many small to midsized companies can typically make the decision to adopt our solution more quickly than larger companies which we believe results in a shorter sales cycle and more closely corresponds to our target sales cycle of 30 to 90 days as a result of the nature and size of our clientele we maintain a diversified client base and very low revenue concentration among our clients we believe however that larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients we serve and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost as we attract clients at the higher end of our target client size range we may face longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales 

competition

the market for hcm solutions is rapidly evolving highly competitive and subject to changing technology shifting client needs and frequent introduction of new products and services our competitors range from small regional firms to large wellestablished international firms with multiple product offerings

we compete with firms that provide hcm solutions by various means many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software but as demand for greater flexibility and access to information grows we believe there will be increased competition in the delivery of hcm cloudbased solutions by other saas providers our competitors offer hcm solutions that may overlap with one several or all categories of applications offered by our solution our talent acquisition and talent management applications compete primarily with cornerstone ondemand inc oracle corporation sap se and workday inc our payroll applications including payroll processing compete primarily with automatic data processing inc “adp” ceridian hcm inc “ceridian” paychex inc paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc our hr management applications compete primarily with adp ceridian oracle corporation paychex inc paylocity holding corporation sap se and workday inc our time and labor management applications compete primarily with adp ceridian kronos incorporated paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc our larger competitors compete with us across multiple segments in addition our hcm solution continues to face competition from inhouse payroll and hr systems and departments as well as hr systems and software sold by thirdparty vendors

competition in the hcm solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation breadth of service application offering and price the importance of these factors depends on the size of the business price tends to be the most important factor of competition for smaller businesses with fewer employees while the scope of features and customization is more important to larger businesses regardless of a company’s size another important factor is the implementation experience as all organizations are seeking a streamlined and simplified process 

sales and marketing

we sell our solution exclusively through our captive sales force substantially all of whom have a fouryear college degree we typically recruit sales candidates who have sales experience in nonhcm industries or with respect to candidates recruited directly from colleges and universities who have demonstrated an aptitude for sales our sales force is comprised of inside sales and field sales personnel who are organized geographically and client relations representatives “crrs” who sell additional applications to existing clients as of the filing of this form 10k we have 49 sales teams located in 26 states and plan to open additional sales offices to further expand our presence in the us market

we provide our sales force with an intensive eightweek training course that includes at least one week of training at our headquarters in oklahoma city our unique training program includes instruction in accounting business metrics application features and tax matters relevant to our target market and we believe it fosters loyalty and helps maintain our corporate culture our training continues for our sales force through weekly inoffice strategy sessions and leadership development training executive sales representatives are also required to attend inperson quarterly conferences to share best practices and receive legal and business updates

when a new client processes payroll with us for an entire month our sales representative receives a onetime commission based upon an estimate of future annual revenues from such client when an existing client purchases and then utilizes a new application for one payroll cycle a crr receives a onetime commission based upon an estimate of future annual revenues from such 

 

 

client executive sales representatives receive a higher commission rate and bas e salary based upon both current year and lifetodate realized sales 

we generate client leads accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs that target senior finance and hr executives technology professionals and senior business leaders of companies that perform hcm functions inhouse or outsource these functions to one of our competitors our marketing programs include







in addition to managing client relationships our crrs are focused on expanding the number of applications our clients purchase from us by introducing them to additional applications our crrs call upon select clients periodically and are paid a nonrecurring commission on any additional sales they generate

technology operations and security

technology

our multitenant architecture enables us to deliver our solution across our client base with a single instance of our solution while securely partitioning access to our clients’ respective application data because a single version of our solution is developed supported and deployed across all of our clients updates are delivered to all of our clients at the same time making it easier to scale our solution as our number of clients and their respective employee headcounts increase

we maintain multiple loadbalanced internet lines serviced by multiple networks to provide our clients continuous access to our solution and their stored data we back up our client data at regular intervals utilizing live replication snapshots and cold archive methods of backup and manually monitor backup success and failure regularly our server cluster and database servers have redundant “hot swappable” disks to ensure continuous service in the event of a disk failure

operations

we physically host our solution for our clients in three secure data center facilities located in oklahoma and texas all of our critical systems are fully redundant and backedup in realtime to these facilities physical security includes idoriented access control alarm systems and manned 24houraday camera monitoring by our security guards server facilities also have environmental monitoring and extensive environmental controls such as heat and fire protection moisture temperature and humidity sensors backup power supply and exterior reinforced concrete walls

security

we maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of our clients’ data during the regular course of business we receive client data through our online system that we in turn process record and store following isoiec 2700012013 certified controls and procedures all communications with our servers that might contain sensitive information are encrypted before they leave the network and our servers are configured to only allow highgrade encryption algorithms

we strictly regulate and limit all access to servers and networks at each of our facilities local network access is restricted by our authenticated server using access control lists and remote network access is restricted by a firewall which provides no accessible route from external networks to systems within our local network we also employ network and host intrusion detection and prevention sensors throughout our infrastructure systems that monitor that infrastructure and alert our security department of cybersecurity issues a system for managing and installing patches for unsecure thirdparty applications and highly restricted access to the internet for anyone who has access to client data our information security department regularly performs penetration testing and we retain a thirdparty penetration testing company to conduct penetration tests and periodic audits to identify and remediate any issues

our applications are secured using multiple libraries and secure coding practices our it infrastructure is secured and monitored using a number of best practices and tools at multiple layers of the physical and logical network this security is also continually monitored by our information security department all of our operations employees work in either our oklahoma or texas locations and with the exception of certain it personnel are not permitted to work remotely

software development

our application development team works closely with our clients to enhance our existing application offerings and develop new applications this process is led by experienced product managers who oversee the evolution of their respective applications within a 

 

 

focused timeframe of innovation and cultivation in order to deliver the welldeveloped applications and enhancements desired by our clients our product managers many of whom are form er hr executives are proactive in their approach to assigning development requests based on research trends and user feedback a key element of our development process is the oneonone personal interaction between clients and our crrs through whom our clients personally suggest new applications and features 

we develop our solution from the “ground up” with our internal development and engineering teams our development and engineering teams and our employees conceive new applications and enhancements review requests schedule development in order of priority and subsequently develop the applications or enhancements our new applications and enhancements are independently reviewed by the quality assurance team in accordance with our software development process before being fully implemented any enhancements to our applications are released on a monthly scheduled release date to coordinate the communication and release to our clients

capitalized software development expenses which include compensation for employees directly associated with development projects were 220 million 158 million and 88 million for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively

client service

we are committed to providing industryleading clientcentered service for this reason we assign each client a specialist within a dedicated team this oneonone service is a key part of our client service model and helps to ensure we are delivering an industryleading solution and maintaining high client satisfaction the primary elements of our client service model include the following

streamlined setup and onboarding

after electing to deploy our solution a new client begins our onboarding process with assistance from a team of new client setup specialists and the sales representative responsible for obtaining the client’s business in addition we also have a team of transition specialists whose job it is to ensure that the process is performed smoothly data is collected properly and all relevant employees are fully trained on the system this team works closely with the client until the client is capable of managing our solution independently at which time responsibility for the client relationship is transferred to our dedicated crrs and service specialists unlike certain of our competitors we do not outsource any of our onboarding efforts

dedicated service specialists

after completing the onboarding process each client is assigned to a services specialist within a dedicated team clients can then contact their dedicated services specialist or a team member if any issues or questions arise these specialists provide personalized service with actual knowledge of the clients’ business needs when appropriate client questions can be elevated to the specialists with the appropriate application regulatory or tax expertise in addition our crrs proactively contact our clients to ensure satisfaction with our solution and introduce additional applications

expert level service

our client specialists are trained across all of our applications to ensure that they can provide comprehensive expertlevel service our client service is iso 90012015 certified and helps support our high client retention rate

regulatory and certifications

we are subject to varying degrees of regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide services local laws and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement differ significantly among those jurisdictions these regulations and laws cover among others information privacy

data privacy has become a significant issue in the united states and in other countries the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future many federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations affecting or regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information in the united states these include for example rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca and state breach notification laws further because some of our clients have establishments in the european union the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” may impact our processing of certain client and employee information

we voluntarily obtain thirdparty security examinations relating to our internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with system and organization controls report i “soc 1” our soc 1 examination is conducted every six months by one of the four largest independent international auditing firms and addresses among other areas our physical and environmental safeguards for production data centers data availability and integrity procedures change management procedures and logical security procedures 

 

 

in october 2016 we renewed a certification based on isoiec 270012013 criteria a security standard for information security management systems published by iso covering our production quality assurance and implementation environments this independent assessment of our conformity to the iso 27001 standard inclu des assessing security risks designing and implementing comprehensive security controls and adopting an information security management process to meet security needs on an ongoing basis the certification is valid until december 2019 with continuing ass essments taking place annually 

in april 2017 we renewed a certification based on iso 90012015 criteria a standard for the implementation of quality management processes published by iso covering our activities required to create and deliver our solution this independent assessment of our conformity to the iso 90012015 standard includes assessing the design and implementation of quality objectives to meet delivery standards on an ongoing basis the certification is valid until april 2020 with continuing assessments taking place annually 

intellectual property

we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights we also have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we do not have any patents or patent applications pending

seasonality

our revenues are seasonal in nature recurring revenues include revenues related to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs such as bonuses for our clients because payroll forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year first quarter revenues and margins are generally higher than in subsequent quarters further beginning in the first quarter of 2016 we began generating additional revenues as a result of the enactment of the aca as many clients began complying with filing requirements for forms 1094 and 1095 we anticipate that our revenues will continue to exhibit this seasonal pattern related to aca form filings for so long as the aca or replacement legislation includes employer reporting requirements in addition we often experience increased revenues during the fourth quarter due to unscheduled payroll runs for our clients that occur before the end of the year therefore we expect the seasonality of our revenue cycle to decrease to the extent clients utilize more of our nonpayroll applications

employees

our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees is critical to our continued success we invest heavily in our training and leadership development programs to encourage the development and promotion of our employees as of december 31 2018 we employed 3050 people substantially all of which are fulltime none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

facilities

our corporate headquarters is an approximately 500000squarefoot campus located on over 30 acres of companyowned property in oklahoma city oklahoma in addition to housing two fully redundant data centers at our corporate headquarters we operate another fully redundant data center at a leased property near dallas texas we plan to relocate our texas operations including the data center to a new expanded facility in grapevine texas we also lease a disaster recovery site in downtown oklahoma city 

we also lease offices in arizona california colorado connecticut florida georgia illinois indiana maryland massachusetts michigan minnesota missouri new jersey new york north carolina ohio oklahoma oregon pennsylvania tennessee texas utah virginia washington and wisconsin we believe that these facilities are suitable for our current operations and upon the expiration of the terms of the leases we believe we could renew these leases or find suitable space elsewhere on acceptable terms

segment information

we operate in a single operating segment and a single reporting segment operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker function which is fulfilled by our chief executive officer in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance our chief executive officer allocates resources and assesses performance based upon financial information at the consolidated level since we operate in one operating segment all required financial segment information is presented in the consolidated financial statements

risk factors 

tableend

the risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this form 10k including those risks identified in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” describe examples of risks uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statement if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect actual outcomes may vary materially from those included in this form 10k

changes in laws government regulations and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

many of our applications are designed to assist our clients in complying with government regulations that continually change the introduction of new regulatory or licensing requirements or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations could increase our cost of doing business changing regulatory requirements may make the introduction of new applications and enhancements more costly or more timeconsuming than we currently anticipate or could prevent the introduction of new applications and enhancements by us altogether changes in laws regulations or policies could also affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for certain of our existing applications which would result in decreased revenues further we may spend time and money developing new applications and enhancements that due to regulatory changes become unnecessary prior to being released in addition any failure to educate and assist our clients with respect to new or revised legislation that impacts them could have an adverse effect on our reputation and any failure to modify our applications or develop new applications in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in addition the future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the internet as a primary medium for commerce communication and business federal state and foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet as a commercial medium changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our applications further government agencies or private organizations may impose taxes fees or other charges for accessing the internet or commerce conducted via the internet these laws or charges could limit the growth of internetrelated commerce or communications generally or could result in reductions in the demand for internetbased applications such as ours

if our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to our clients’ or their employees’ sensitive data is otherwise obtained our solution may not be perceived as being secure clients may reduce the use of or stop using our solution our ability to attract new clients may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities

our solution involves the collection storage and transmission of clients’ and their employees’ confidential and proprietary information including personal identifying information as well as financial and payroll data hcm software is often targeted in cyberattacks including computer viruses worms phishing attacks malicious software programs and other information security breaches which could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our clients’ sensitive data or otherwise disrupt our clients’ or other third parties’ business operations if cybercriminals are able to circumvent our security measures or if we are unable to detect an intrusion into our systems and contain such intrusion in a reasonable amount of time our clients’ sensitive data may be compromised

certain of our employees have access to sensitive information about our clients’ employees while we conduct background checks of our employees and limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls resulting in a security breach 

although we have security measures in place to protect client information and prevent data loss and other security breaches these measures could be breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently we may not be able to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative or protective measures while we currently maintain a cyber liability insurance policy cyber liability insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our cyber liability insurance policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention from our business and operations

any actual or perceived breach of our security could damage our reputation cause existing clients to discontinue the use of our solution prevent us from attracting new clients or subject us to thirdparty lawsuits regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

 

 

any damage failure or disruption of our saas network infrastructure or data centers could impair our ability to effectively provide our solution harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

our saas network infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations our clients access our solution through standard web browsers smart phones tablets and other webenabled devices and depend on us for fast and reliable access to our solution we serve all of our clients from our three fully redundant data centers located in oklahoma and texas our saas network infrastructure and data centers are vulnerable to damage failure and disruption 

in the future we may experience issues with our computing and communications infrastructure or data centers caused by the following factors

















if our saas network infrastructure or our clients’ ability to access our solution is interrupted client and employee data from recent transactions may be permanently lost and we could be exposed to significant claims by clients particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds payable to employees further any adverse changes in service levels at our data centers resulting from damage to or failure of our data centers could result in disruptions in our services any significant instances of system downtime or performance problems at our data centers could negatively affect our reputation and ability to attract new clients prevent us from gaining new or additional business from our current clients or cause our current clients to terminate their use of our solution any of which would adversely impact our revenues in addition if our network infrastructure and data centers fail to support increased capacity due to growth in our business our clients may experience interruptions in the availability of our solution such interruptions may reduce our revenues cause us to issue refunds to clients or adversely affect our retention of existing clients any of which could have a negative impact on our business operating results or financial condition

privacy concerns and laws or other regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our applications

our applications are subject to various complex laws and regulations on the federal state and local levels including those governing data privacy which has become a significant issue globally the regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future many federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information in the united states these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca federal and state labor and employment laws and state data breach notification laws further because some of our clients have establishments in the european union gdpr may impact our processing of certain client and employee information failure to comply with privacy laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition

in addition to government regulation privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different selfregulatory standards because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws are still uncertain it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our solution any failure to comply with government regulations that apply to our applications including privacy and data protection laws could subject us to liability in addition to the possibility of fines lawsuits and other claims we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our solution which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition any inability to adequately address privacy concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws regulations and policies could result in additional cost and liability to us damage our reputation inhibit sales and adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

furthermore privacy concerns may cause our clients’ employees to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our clients and their employees to use our applications effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our applications in certain industries all of these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect 

 

 

the ability of our clients to process handle store use and transmit demographic and personal information from their employees which could reduce demand for our solution 

the market in which we participate is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected

the market for hcm software is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented we expect competition to intensify in the future with the introduction of new technologies and new market entrants many of our current and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition longer operating histories more established relationships in the industry and significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as a result some of these competitors may be able to















some of our principal competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures similarly some competitors offer different billing terms which has resulted in pressures on our billing terms if we are unable to maintain our pricing levels and our billing terms our operating results would be negatively impacted in addition pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales reduced margins losses or the failure of our solution to maintain widespread market acceptance any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

we compete with firms that provide hcm solutions by various means our competitors offer hcm solutions that overlap with one several or all categories of applications that we offer our talent acquisition and talent management applications compete primarily with cornerstone ondemand inc oracle corporation sap se and workday inc our payroll applications including payroll processing compete primarily with adp ceridian concur technologies inc intuit inc paychex inc paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc our hr management applications compete primarily with adp ceridian oracle corporation paychex inc paylocity holding corporation sap se and workday inc our time and labor management applications compete primarily with adp ceridian kronos incorporated paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc most of our larger competitors compete with us across multiple application categories in addition our hcm solution continues to face competition from inhouse payroll and hr systems as well as hr systems and software sold by thirdparty vendors

competition in the hcm solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness application quality and reputation breadth of service and product offering and price many of our competitors have established marketing relationships access to larger client bases and major distribution agreements with consultants software vendors and distributors in addition some competitors may offer software that addresses one or a limited number of hcm functions at a lower price point or with greater depth than our solution further some potential clients particularly large enterprises may elect to develop their own internal solutions if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected

the adoption of new or adverse interpretations of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes could subject us to additional regulation and related expenses and require changes to our business

the adoption of new money transmitter or money services business statutes in jurisdictions changes in regulators’ interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes or regulations or disagreements by regulatory authorities with our interpretation of such statutes or regulations could subject us to registration or licensing or limit business activities until we are appropriately licensed these occurrences could also require changes to the manner in which we conduct certain aspects of our business or invest client funds which could adversely impact the amount of interest income we receive from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities and accounts designated by our clients

while we maintain that we are not a money services business or money transmitter we have adopted an antimoney laundering “aml” compliance program to mitigate the risk of our application being used for illegal or illicit activity and to help detect and prevent fraud our aml compliance program is designed to foster trust in our application and services 

 

 

recently we were required to register as a “money services business” in one jurisdiction should other state or fed eral regulators make a determination that we have operated as an unlicensed money services business or money transmitter we could be subject to civil and criminal fines penalties costs of registration legal fees reputational damage or other negative c onsequences all of which may have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

our financial results may fluctuate due to many factors some of which may be beyond our control

our results of operations including our revenues costs of revenues administrative expenses operating income cash flow and deferred revenue may vary significantly in the future and the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance fluctuations in our financial results may negatively impact the value of our common stock our financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control and as a result may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate from period to period include without limitation





































our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth and organizational change if we fail to manage such growth and change effectively we may be unable to execute our business plan maintain high levels of service or adequately address competitive challenges

we have experienced and may continue to experience rapid growth in our headcount and operations which has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management operational and financial resources for example our headcount has grown from 523 employees as of december 31 2011 to 3050 employees as of december 31 2018 and we have expanded from 20 sales teams as of december 31 2011 to 49 sales teams as of the filing of this form 10k we have also experienced significant growth in the number of clients and transactions and the amount of client and employee data that our infrastructure supports finally our organizational structure and recording systems and procedures are becoming more complex as we improve our operational financial and management controls our success depends in part on our ability to manage this growth and organizational change effectively 

 

 

to manage the expected growth of our headcount and operations we m ust continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures the failure to effectively manage growth could result in declines in the quality of or client satisfaction with our applications increas es in costs difficulties in introducing new applications or other operational difficulties any of which could adversely affect our business by impairing our ability to retain and attract clients or sell additional applications to our existing clients 

further we need to continue to expand our sales force and support team members in order to grow our client base and increase our revenues but our ability to add additional offices may be constrained by the willingness and availability of qualified personnel to staff and manage any new offices and our success in recruiting and training sales personnel in those new offices if our expansion efforts are unsuccessful our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our deployment or technical support services or if our solution fails to perform properly

our business depends on our ability to satisfy our clients both with respect to our applications and the technical support provided to help our clients use the applications that address the needs of their businesses we use our inhouse deployment personnel to implement and configure our solution and provide support to our clients if a client is not satisfied with the quality of our solution the applications delivered or the support provided we could incur additional costs to address the situation our profitability might be negatively affected and the client’s dissatisfaction with our deployment or support service could harm our ability to sell additional applications to that client in addition our sales process is highly dependent on the reputation of our solution and applications and on positive recommendations from our existing clients our clients have no obligation to continue to use our applications and may choose not to continue to use our applications at the same or higher level of service if at all in the past some of our clients have elected not to continue to use our applications moreover our clients generally have the right to cancel their agreements with us for any or no reason by providing 30 days’ prior written notice any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality technical support could adversely affect client retention our reputation our ability to sell our applications to existing and prospective clients and as a result our business operating results or financial condition 

further our solution is inherently complex and may in the future contain or develop undetected defects or errors any defects in our applications could adversely affect our reputation impair our ability to sell our applications in the future and result in significant costs to us the costs incurred in correcting any application defects may be substantial and could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition any defects in functionality or that cause interruptions in the availability of our applications could result in 













because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our applications could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our clients regard as significant our clients might assert claims against us in the future alleging that they suffered damages due to a defect error or other failure of our solution our errors and omissions insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention any failures in the performance of our solution could harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients which would have an adverse impact on our business operating results or financial condition

if we are not able to develop enhancements and new applications keep pace with technological developments or respond to future disruptive technologies we might not remain competitive and our business could be adversely affected

our continued success will depend on our ability to adapt and innovate in order to attract new clients and increase revenues from existing clients we need to enhance add new features to and improve our existing applications and introduce new applications the success of any enhancements or new features and applications depends on several factors including timely completion and introduction and market acceptance we may expend significant time and resources developing and pursuing sales of a particular enhancement or application that may not result in revenues in the anticipated time frame or at all or may not result in revenue growth sufficient to offset increased expenses further changing legal and regulatory requirements may delay the development or introduction of enhancements or new applications or render certain of our applications obsolete if we are unable to successfully 

 

 

develop enhancements new features or new applications to meet client needs our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

in addition because our applications are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using internet tools and protocols we must continuously modify and enhance our applications to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies if we are unable to respond in a timely and costeffective manner to these rapid technological developments our current and future applications may become less marketable and less competitive or even obsolete

our success is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver hcm solutions at lower prices more efficiently or more conveniently such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete

the market for our solution among large companies may be limited if these companies demand customized features and functions that we do not offer

prospective clients especially larger companies may require customized features and functions unique to their business processes that we do not offer in order to ensure we meet these requirements we may devote a significant amount of support and service resources to larger prospective clients increasing the cost and time required to complete sales with no guarantee that these prospective clients will adopt our solution further we may not be successful in implementing any customized features or functions if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we do not offer or that would be difficult for them to deploy themselves the market for our solution will be more limited and our business could be adversely affected

we are dependent on the continued service of our key executives and if we fail to retain such key executives our business could be adversely affected

we believe that our success depends in part on the continued services of our senior management team consisting of chad richison craig e boelte jeffrey d york jon evans and bradley s smith our business could be adversely affected if we fail to retain these key executives although the employment arrangements of certain of our key executives contain noncompetition restrictions our business could nonetheless be adversely affected if a key executive leaves paycom and attempts to compete with us in addition we have not purchased key person life insurance on any members of our senior management team 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel including software developers and skilled it sales and marketing personnel our ability to develop and market new and existing products and in turn increase our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected

our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new applications as a result we are heavily dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified software developers and it personnel with the requisite education background and industry experience in addition to continue to execute our growth strategy we must also attract and retain qualified sales marketing and operational personnel capable of supporting a larger and more diverse client base the software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors this competition for qualified personnel may be amplified by new immigration laws or policies that could limit software companies’ ability to recruit internationally although such changes in immigration laws or policies would not have a significant direct impact on our workforce the ensuing increase in demand for software developers and it personnel could impair our ability to attract or retain skilled employees andor significantly increase our costs to do so furthermore identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use of our applications requires significant time expense and attention and it can take a substantial amount of time before our employees are fully trained and productive the loss of the services of a significant number of employees could be disruptive to our development efforts which may adversely affect our business by causing us to lose clients increase operating expenses or divert management’s attention to recruit replacements for the departed employees

the failure to develop and maintain our brand costeffectively could have an adverse effect on our business

we believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a costeffective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our solution and is an important element in attracting new clients and retaining existing clients successful promotion of our brand depends largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful applications at competitive prices brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues and even if they do any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brand if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand we may fail to attract enough new clients or retain our existing clients to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding efforts which could have an adverse effect on our business

certain of our operating results and financial metrics may be difficult to predict as a result of seasonality

we have historically experienced seasonality in our revenues because a significant portion of our recurring revenues relate to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 and beginning in 2016 the annual processing and filing of 

 

 

acarelated forms because these forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year first quarter revenues are generally higher than revenues in subsequent quarters in addition unscheduled payroll runs at the end of the year such as bonuse s often result in increased revenues in the fourth quarter we expect this seasonality to continue in the future although the repeal or modification of the aca could have an impact on the seasonality of our revenues seasonal fluctuations in certain of our operating results and financial metrics may make such results and metrics difficult to predict 

the modification or repeal of certain provisions of the aca could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we generate acarelated revenues i on an annual basis in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients and ii from clients who have purchased our enhanced aca application as part of the fixed bundled price charged per billing period on january 20 2017 president donald j trump issued an executive order stating that it is the policy of the new administration to seek the prompt repeal of the aca despite multiple efforts congress was unable to pass legislation significantly repealing or replacing the aca in 2017 but many uncertainties remain regarding its future the trump administration took additional action in october 2017 that may weaken the aca’s public health insurance marketplace and the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 enacted december 22 2017 eliminates the aca’s individual mandate penalty beginning january 1 2019 both events suggest additional action to further weaken repeal or replace the aca may occur the modification or repeal of certain provisions of the aca could harm our business operating results and financial condition if the aca is modified to eliminate the employer reporting requirements or if the aca is repealed and replaced with new legislation that does not include similar employer reporting requirements we will no longer generate revenues in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients while we generally do not track our revenues on an applicationbyapplication basis because applications are often sold in various groupings and configurations for a single price we estimate that if the aca is not modified or repealed revenues from our enhanced aca application and aca forms filings business will represent approximately 4 of total projected revenues for the year ending december 31 2019 further uncertainty regarding the potential future modification repeal or replacement of the aca could adversely affect our ability to sell our enhanced aca application to new clients

if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights our competitive advantage could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets generate reduced revenues or incur costly litigation to protect our rights

our success is dependent in part upon our intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and to protect our intellectual property rights however the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our applications and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products or services that compete with ours

we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property we have been involved in litigation in the past and litigation may be necessary in the future to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets such litigation could be costly timeconsuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights we may not be able to secure protect and enforce our intellectual property rights or control access to and the distribution of our solution and proprietary information which could adversely affect our business

we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights

considerable intellectual property development activity exists in our industry and we expect that software developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of applications and competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps our competitors as well as a number of other entities and individuals may own or claim to own intellectual property in technology areas relating to our solution or applications in addition we may increasingly be subject to trademark infringement claims as our presence grows in the marketplace from time to time third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights a claim of infringement may also be made relating to technology that we acquire or license from third parties however we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover or may be alleged to cover some or all of our solution applications or brands

the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable and as a result any future litigation or claim of infringement could i cause us to enter into an unfavorable royalty or license agreement pay ongoing royalties or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms ii require us to discontinue the sale of our solution or applications iii require us to indemnify our clients or thirdparty service providers or iv require us to expend additional development resources to redesign our solution or applications any of these outcomes could harm our business even if we were to prevail any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business and operations

 

 

the use of open source software in our applications may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property rights 

some of our applications use software covered by open source licenses from time to time there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate such software into their products or applications as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software litigation could be costly for us to defend have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional development resources to change our applications in addition if we were to combine our applications with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain of the open source licenses be required to release the source code of our applications if we inappropriately use open source software we may be required to redesign our applications discontinue the sale of our applications or take other remedial actions which could adversely impact our business operating results or financial condition

we employ thirdparty licensed software for use in our applications and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs or reduced service levels which could adversely affect our business

our applications incorporate certain thirdparty software obtained under licenses from other companies we anticipate that we will continue to rely on such thirdparty software and development tools from third parties in the future although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the thirdparty software we currently license this may not always be the case or it may be difficult or costly to replace in addition incorporating the software used in our applications with new thirdparty software may require significant work and substantial investment of our time and resources also to the extent that our applications depend upon the successful operation of thirdparty software in conjunction with our software any undetected errors or defects in this thirdparty software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our applications delay new application introductions result in a failure of our applications and harm our reputation

adverse economic and market conditions could affect our business operating results or financial condition

our business depends on the overall demand for hcm applications and on the economic health of our current and prospective clients if economic conditions in the united states or in global markets deteriorate clients may cease their operations eliminate or reduce unscheduled payroll runs such as bonuses reduce headcount delay or reduce their spending on hcm and other outsourcing services or attempt to renegotiate their contracts with us an economic decline could result in reductions in sales of our applications decreased revenue from unscheduled payroll runs and fees charged on a peremployee basis longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition in addition hcm spending levels may not increase following any recovery

in recent years there have been several instances when there has been uncertainty regarding the ability of congress and the president collectively to reach agreement on federal budgetary and spending matters a period of failure to reach agreement on these matters particularly if accompanied by an actual or threatened government shutdown may have an adverse impact on the us economy additionally because certain of our clients rely on government resources to fund their operations a prolonged government shutdown may affect such clients’ ability to make timely payments to us which could adversely affect our operations results or financial condition

further as part of our payroll and tax filing application we collect and then remit client funds to taxing authorities and accounts designated by our clients during the interval between receipt and disbursement we may invest such funds in money market funds demand deposit accounts certificates of deposit and commercial paper these investments are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks and such risks may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility any loss of or inability to access such funds could have an adverse impact on our cash position and results of operations and could require us to obtain additional sources of liquidity which may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us if at all

our outstanding indebtedness is subject to certain operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities and may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business

we have incurred indebtedness to fund certain construction projects at our corporate headquarters pursuant to the terms of our outstanding indebtedness we may not subject to certain exceptions













 

 







in addition we are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” to fixed charges defined as current maturities of longterm debt interest expense rent expense and distributions of not less than 125 to 10 and a funded indebtedness defined as total indebtedness less accounts payable accrued expenses and deferred revenues to ebitda of not greater than 20 to 10 the operating and financial covenants in the loan agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into may restrict our ability to finance our operations engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies we may also be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on our debt which would reduce the amount of money available for operations working capital expansion or other general corporate purposes

our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations and comply with the operating and financial covenants may be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to control many of these factors and comply with these covenants a breach of any of the covenants under our loan agreements could result in an event of default which could cause all of our outstanding indebtedness to become immediately due and payable

we may acquire other businesses applications or technologies which could divert our management’s attention result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results

in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses applications or technologies that we believe complement or expand our applications enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities the pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur expenses in identifying investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions whether or not they are ultimately consummated

we do not have any experience in acquiring other businesses if we acquire additional businesses we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel operations and technologies successfully or to effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition we also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors including























in addition a significant portion of the purchase price of any companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets which must be assessed for impairment at least annually in the future if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process which could harm our results of operations acquisitions could also result in issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt which would result in dilution to our stockholders

our growth depends in part on the success of our relationships with third parties

we rely on thirdparty financial and accounting processing systems as well as various financial institutions to perform financial services in connection with our applications such as providing automated clearing house “ach” and wire transfers as part of our payroll and expense reimbursement services and to provide technology and content support manufacture time clocks and process 

 

 

background checks we anticipate that we will continue to de pend on various thirdparty relationships in order to grow our business provide technology and content support manufacture time clocks and process background checks identifying negotiating and documenting relationships with these third parties and inte grating thirdparty content and technology requires significant time and resources our agreements with third parties typically are nonexclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors in addition these third parties may not perform a s expected under our agreements and we may have disagreements or disputes with such third parties which could negatively affect our brand and reputation a global economic slowdown could also adversely affect the businesses of our thirdparty providers particularly those financial institutions that process transactions through the ach network and it is possible that they may not be able to devote the resources we expect to our relationship 

if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected even if we are successful these relationships may not result in improved operating results

if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings

we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as of december 31 2018 we had recorded a total of 519 million of goodwill and 07 million of other intangible assets an adverse change in domestic or global market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of our critical assumptions or estimates made in connection with the impairment testing of goodwill or intangible assets could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge to our goodwill or other intangible assets any such material charges may have a negative impact on our operating results or financial condition

we may pay employees and taxing authorities amounts due for a payroll period before a client’s electronic funds transfers are finally settled to our account if client payments are rejected by banking institutions or otherwise fail to clear into our accounts we may require additional sources of shortterm liquidity and our operating results could be adversely affected

our payroll processing application moves significant funds from the account of a client to employees and relevant taxing authorities for larger funding amounts we require clients to transfer the funds to us via fed wire for smaller funding amounts we debit a client’s account prior to any disbursement on its behalf and due to ach banking regulations funds previously credited could be reversed under certain circumstances and time frames after our payment of amounts due to employees and taxing and other regulatory authorities there is therefore a risk that the employer’s funds will be insufficient to cover the amounts we have already paid on its behalf while such shortage and accompanying financial exposure has only occurred in very limited circumstances in the past should clients default on their payment obligations in the future we might be required to advance substantial funds to cover such obligations in such an event we may be required to seek additional sources of shortterm liquidity which may not be available on reasonable terms if at all and our operating results and our liquidity could be adversely affected and our banking relationships could be harmed

because our longterm success may depend in part on our ability to expand the sales of our solution to clients located outside of the united states our business could be subject to risks associated with international operations

an element of our growth strategy is to expand our operations and client base to date we have not engaged in any operations outside of the united states if we decide to expand our operations into international markets it will require significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory economic and political risks that are different from those in the united states because of our lack of experience with international operations we cannot ensure that our international expansion efforts will be successful and the impact of such expansion efforts may adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected

as a public company we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements management must evaluate and furnish a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and our auditors must attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting

if we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports andor we could become subject to investigations by the new york stock exchange the “nyse” the sec or other regulatory authorities and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected

 

 

adverse tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our clients which could increase the costs of our solution and applications and could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

as a vendor of services we are ordinarily held responsible by taxing authorities for collecting and paying any applicable sales or other similar taxes additionally the application of federal state and local tax laws to services provided electronically like ours is evolving new income sales use or other tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time possibly with retroactive effect and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services and applications provided over the internet these enactments could adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and ultimately could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that change over time we review these rules and regulations periodically and when we believe we are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state we may voluntarily engage state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with that state’s rules and regulations we cannot ensure that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we currently believe no such taxes are required 

in addition existing tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be interpreted changed modified or applied adversely to us possibly with retroactive effect which could require us or our clients to pay additional tax amounts as well as require us or our clients to pay fines or penalties and substantial interest for past amounts if we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our clients we could be held liable for such costs thereby adversely affecting our business operating results or financial condition additionally the imposition of such taxes on us would effectively increase the cost of our software and services we provide to clients and would likely have a negative impact on our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the jurisdictions in which such taxes are imposed

our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance

from time to time we have released and may continue to release guidance in our earnings conference calls earnings releases or otherwise regarding our future performance which represents our estimates as of the date of release this guidance which includes forwardlooking statements has been and will be based on projections prepared by our management these projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections accordingly no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections

projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that while presented with numerical specificity are inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control projections are also based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions some of which will change the principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any third parties

guidance is necessarily speculative in nature and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will vary significantly from actual results accordingly our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material in light of the foregoing investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this “form 10k” the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties see part i “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” for a discussion of the uncertainties risks and assumptions associated with those statements actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward looking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in the section entitled “risk factors” unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires the terms “we” “us” “our” and the “company” refer to paycom software inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 

overview

we are a leading provider of comprehensive cloudbased human capital management “hcm” software delivered as softwareasaservice we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment lifecycle from recruitment to retirement our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions including talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and human resources management applications our userfriendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees enabling selfmanagement of their hcm activities in the cloud which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity

we generate revenues from i fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed and ii fixed amounts charged per billing period we do not require clients to enter into longterm contractual commitments with us our billing period varies by client based on when they pay their employees which is either weekly biweekly semimonthly or monthly our revenues are primarily generated through our sales force that solicits new clients and our client relations representatives who sell new applications to existing clients

we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry none of our clients constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2018 we stored data for over 41 million persons employed by our clients during the year ended december 31 2018

our continued growth depends on the introduction of new applications to our existing client base while targeting a high degree of client employee usage across those applications attracting new clients through further penetration of our existing markets and geographic expansion into new markets during the year ended december 31 2018 we opened new sales offices in salt lake city utah rochester new york columbus ohio and san diego california the opening of these four new sales offices brings our total number of sales teams to 49 sales teams located in 26 states we plan to open additional sales offices in the future to further expand our presence in the us market we also plan to relocate our texas operations to a new expanded facility in grapevine texas with construction scheduled to begin in the first half of 2019 our principal marketing efforts include email campaigns social and digital media search engine marketing methods tradeshows and outbound marketing including television and print advertising in addition we generate leads and build recognition of our brand and thought leadership with relevant and informative content such as white papers blogs podcast episodes and webinars

during the last three years we have developed several new applications we believe our ability to continue to develop new applications and to improve existing applications will enable us to increase revenues in the future and the number of our new applications adopted by our clients has been a significant factor in our revenue growth over the last three years

growth outlook opportunities and challenges

based on our total revenues we have grown at a 39 compound annual growth rate from january 1 2015 through december 31 2018 as a result of our significant revenue growth and geographic expansion since our initial public offering in april 2014 we are presented with a variety of opportunities and challenges our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications consequently we have historically generated the majority of our revenues from our payroll applications although our revenue mix has evolved and will continue to evolve as we develop and add new nonpayroll applications to our solution we believe our strategy of focusing on increased employee usage is key to longterm client satisfaction and client retention client adoption of new applications and client employee usage of both new and existing applications have been significant factors in our revenue growth and we expect the continuation of this trajectory will depend in part on the introduction of applications to our existing client base that encourage and promote more employee usage moreover in order to increase revenues and continue to improve our operating results we must also attract new clients we intend to obtain new clients by i continuing to leverage our salesforce productivity within markets where we currently have existing sales offices ii expanding our presence in metropolitan areas where we currently have an existing sales office through adding sales 

 

 

teams or offices thereby increasing the number of sales professionals within such markets and iii opening sales offices in new metropolitan areas 

our target client size range is 50 to 5000 employees while we continue to serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one employee to many thousands of employees the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations increased the number of applications we offer and experienced traction with larger companies our solution requires no adjustment to serve larger clients we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of potential clients and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost to us because we charge our clients on a peremployee basis for certain services we provide any increase or decrease in the number of employees at our clients will have a positive or negative impact respectively on our results of operations we expect that changes in certain factors affecting our performance will correlate with improvement or deterioration in the labor market

throughout our history we have built strong relationships with our clients as the hcm needs of our clients evolve we believe that we are wellpositioned to gain additional share of the hcm spending of our clients and we believe this opportunity is significant to be successful we must continue to demonstrate the operational and economic benefits of our solution as well as effectively hire train motivate and retain qualified personnel

growing our business has resulted in and will continue to result in substantial investments in sales professionals operating expenses system development and programming costs and general and administrative expenses which have and will continue to increase our expenses specifically our revenue growth and geographic expansion drive increases in our employee headcount which in turn precipitates an increase in i salaries and benefits ii stockbased compensation expense and iii facility costs related to the expansion of our corporate headquarters operations facilities and additional sales office leases

we believe the challenges of managing the everchanging complexity of payroll and human resources will continue to drive companies to turn to outsourced providers for help with their hcm needs the hcm industry historically has been driven in part by legislation and regulatory action including cobra changes to the minimum wage laws or overtime rules and legislation from federal state or municipal taxation authorities the implementation of the affordable care act the “aca” is an example of legislation that has created demand in the hcm industry we generate acarelated revenues i on an annual basis in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients and ii from clients who have purchased our enhanced aca application as part of the fixed bundled price charged per billing period while we generally do not track our revenues on an applicationbyapplication basis because applications are often sold in various groupings and configurations for a single price we estimate that if the aca is not modified or repealed revenues from our enhanced aca application and aca forms filings business will represent approximately 4 of total projected revenues for the year ending december 31 2019

for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 our gross margins were approximately 84 83 and 84 respectively although our gross margins may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonality and hiring trends we expect our gross margins will remain relatively constant in future periods

key metrics

in addition to the us gaap and nongaap metrics discussed elsewhere in this form 10k we also monitor the following metrics to evaluate our business measure our performance and identify trends affecting our business 

 



 





 

 





components of results of operations

sources of revenues 

revenues are comprised of recurring revenues and implementation and other revenues we expect our revenues to increase as we introduce new applications expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients as a percentage of total revenues we expect our mix of recurring revenues and implementation and other revenues to remain relatively constant

recurring revenues 

recurring revenues include fees for our talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for form filings and delivery of client payroll checks and reports these revenues are derived from i fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed or ii fixed amounts charged per billing period we do not require clients to enter into longterm contractual commitments with us our billing period varies by client based on when they pay their employees which is done either weekly biweekly semimonthly or monthly because recurring revenues are based in part on fees for use of our applications and the delivery of checks and reports that are levied on a peremployee basis our recurring revenues increase as our clients hire more employees recurring revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered 

recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs such as bonuses for our clients because payroll forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year and many of our clients have been subject to aca form filing requirements in the first quarter first quarter revenues and margins are generally higher than in subsequent quarters we anticipate our revenues will continue to exhibit this seasonal pattern related to aca form filings for so long as the aca or replacement legislation includes employer reporting requirements in addition we often experience increased revenues during the fourth quarter due to unscheduled payroll runs for our clients that occur before the end of the year therefore we expect the seasonality of our revenue cycle to decrease to the extent clients utilize more of our nonpayroll applications

beginning april 1 2016 recurring revenues also include interest earned on funds held for clients we collect funds from clients in advance of either the applicable due date for payroll tax submissions or the applicable disbursement date for employee payment services these collections from clients are typically disbursed from one to 30 days after receipt with some funds being held for up to 120 days we typically invest funds held for clients in money market funds demand deposit accounts commercial paper and certificates of deposit until they are paid to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees we expect interest earned on funds held for clients will increase as we introduce new applications expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients the amount of interest we earn from the investment of client funds is also impacted by changes in interest rates 

implementation and other revenues 

implementation and other revenues are comprised of implementation fees for the deployment of our solution and other revenues from sales of time clocks as part of our time and attendance services nonrefundable implementation fees are charged to new clients at inception and upon the addition of certain incremental applications for existing clients these fees range from 10 to 30 of the annualized value of the transaction implementation revenues are recognized as deferred revenue and amortized into income over the life of the client which is estimated to be ten years and other revenues are recognized upon shipment of time clocks implementation and other revenues comprised approximately 16 and 18 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

cost of revenues

cost of revenues consists of expenses related to hosting and supporting our applications hardware costs systems support and technology and depreciation and amortization these costs include employeerelated expenses including noncash stockbased compensation expenses and other expenses related to client support bank charges for processing ach transactions certain implementation expenses delivery charges and paper costs they also include our cost for time clocks sold and ongoing technology and support costs related to our systems the amount of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment allocated to cost of revenues is determined based upon an estimate of assets used to support our operations

provision for income taxes

our consolidated financial statements include a provision for income taxes incurred for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as for any operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we recognize a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized

revenues

the increase in total revenues for the year ended december 31 2018 from the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily the result of i the addition of new clients and productivity and efficiency gains in mature sales offices which are offices that have been open for at least 24 months and in sales offices that reached maturity in 2018 ii contributions from new sales offices opened in 2017 that were progressing to maturity during 2018 iii the sale of additional applications to our existing clients iv the strong performance of our tax forms filing business and v higher average interest rates earned on funds held for clients 

the increase in implementation and other revenues for the year ended december 31 2018 from the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily the result of the recognition of additional nonrefundable conversion fees that are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client setup these fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the tenyear estimated life of our clients

the increase in total revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 from the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily the result of i the addition of new clients in mature sales offices ii contributions from the six new sales offices opened in 2016 that were progressing to maturity during 2017 iii the sale of additional applications to our existing clients iv the strong performance of our tax forms filing business and v growth in our clients’ employee headcounts as a result of favorable economic conditions nonetheless the magnitude of the increases in revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 was offset in part due to the impact of hurricanes in texas and florida in august and september in particular we experienced some disruption to our prospecting and conversion efforts in the affected areas as well as implementation delays for new clients 

the increase in implementation and other revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 from the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily the result of the recognition of additional nonrefundable conversion fees that are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client setup these fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the tenyear estimated life of our clients 

 

 

expenses 

cost of revenues

the increase in cost of revenues of 187 million for the year ended december 31 2018 from the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily due to an 89 million increase in operating expenses attributable to growth in the number of operating personnel a 47 million increase in shipping and automated clearing house fees related to the yearoveryear increase in revenues and a 01 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense depreciation and amortization expense increased 49 million or 52 primarily due to placing our fourth headquarters building in service in june 2018 the development of additional technology and purchases of other assets

the increase in cost of revenues of 180 million for the year ended december 31 2017 from the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily due to a 122 million increase in employeerelated expenses which consisted of a 105 million increase in expenses attributable to growth in the number of operating personnel and a 17 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense additionally shipping fees and ach fees increased 11 million and 09 million respectively in connection with increased sales depreciation and amortization expense increased 38 million or 65 primarily due to the development of additional technology and purchases of other assets particularly with respect to the new headquarters building that was not in service for the entire prior year period

administrative expenses

sales and marketing

during the year ended december 31 2018 sales and marketing expenses increased from the prior year by 330 million due to a 237 million increase in employeerelated expenses including commissions bonuses and noncash stockbased compensation and a 93 million increase in marketing and advertising expense primarily due to a national advertising campaign executed in the second half of 2018 the increase in employeerelated expenses included a 25 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense

during the year ended december 31 2017 sales and marketing expenses increased from the prior year by 255 million due to a 213 million increase in employeerelated expenses including commissions bonuses and noncash stockbased compensation and a 42 million increase in marketing and advertising expense the increase in employeerelated expenses included a 20 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense

during the year ended december 31 2017 research and development expenses increased from the prior year due to a 95 million increase in employeerelated expenses including a 11 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense

as we continue to develop our platform and product offerings we generally expect research and development expenses exclusive of stockbased compensation to continue to increase particularly as we hire more personnel to support our growth while we expect this trend to continue on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of total revenues we also anticipate the rate of increase to decline over time as we leverage our growth and realize additional economies of scale 

 

 

expenditures for software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized ov er a threeyear period on a straightline basis the nature of the development projects underway during a particular period directly impacts the timing and extent of these capitalized expenditures and can affect the amount of research and development expe nses in such period the table below sets forth the amounts of capitalized and expensed research and development costs for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 

 



 

general and administrative

 prior year amounts have been recast to reflect the adoption of asu 201409 see note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a description of adjustments  

 

during the year ended december 31 2018 our noncash stockbased compensation expense increased 04 million from the prior year primarily due to the issuance and subsequent accelerated vesting of restricted stock subject to marketbased vesting conditions during the first quarter of 2018 which exceeded expenses associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock subject to marketbased vesting conditions in 2017

during the year ended december 31 2017 our noncash stockbased compensation expense increased 153 million from the prior year primarily due to the vesting of restricted stock with marketbased vesting conditions and the issuance of restricted stock with a higher grantdate fair value than shares issued in the prior year

depreciation and amortization

during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 depreciation and amortization expense increased from the respective comparable prior year periods primarily due to the development of additional technology and purchases of other assets particularly with respect to the timing of new buildings and a parking garage that were placed in service in 2018 and 2017 respectively

 

 

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2018 decreased 01 million from the prior year primarily due to increased capitalized interest related to the construction of our fourth headquarters building in the first half of 2018 interest expense for the year ended december 31 2017 decreased 01 million from the comparable prior year period primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest related to the construction of our third and fourth headquarters buildings during 2017 

other income net

for the year ended december 31 2018 other income net increased from the prior year by 28 million due primarily to the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swap and the loss on early repayment of debt which occurred in 2017 for the year ended december 31 2017 other income net decreased 14 million compared to the year ended december 31 2016 primarily due to a 09 million loss on early repayment of debt and a 06 million unrealized loss recognized on the fair value of an interest rate swap 

provision for income taxes

for the year ended december 31 2018 income tax expense increased 334 million compared to the year ended december 31 2017 income tax expense in 2017 was lower due to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” and recognition of excess tax benefits from sharebased payment awards due to the vesting of various marketbased stock awards during 2017 as a result of the tax act we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on expected future rates this remeasurement as adjusted for the adoption of asu 201409 resulted in a 249 million benefit to our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2017

liquidity and capital resources

our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents which totaled 457 million and 461 million as of december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively our cash and cash equivalents are comprised primarily of demand deposit accounts money market funds and certificates of deposit we also have the ability to borrow funds pursuant to a senior secured revolving credit facility the “facility” in the aggregate principal amount of 500 million which may be increased up to 1000 million subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying certain other conditions we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months

we have historically financed our operations from cash flows generated from operations cash from the sale of equity securities and debt financing although we have funded most of the costs for ongoing construction projects at our corporate headquarters from available cash we have incurred indebtedness for a portion of these costs further all purchases under our stock repurchase plans were funded from available cash

in connection with entering into the term credit agreement we also entered in to a floatingtofixed interest rate swap agreement to limit the exposure to interest rate risk related to the term loans the “interest rate swap agreement” the interest rate swap agreement which has a maturity date of september 7 2025 provides that we will receive quarterly variable interest payments based on the libor rate and will pay interest at a fixed rate we have elected not to designate this interest rate swap as a hedge and as such changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument a re recognized in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 we recognized a gain of 07 million and a loss of 06 million respectively for the change in fair value of the interest rate swap which is include d in other income net in the consolidated statements of income 

revolving credit agreement on february 12 2018 we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement the “revolving credit agreement” with jpmorgan chase bank na and bank of america na which provides for the facility in the aggregate principal amount of 500 million which may be increased to up to 1000 million subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying certain other conditions the facility includes a 50 million sublimit for swingline loans and a 25 million sublimit for letters of credit the facility is scheduled to mature on february 12 2020 borrowings under the facility will generally bear interest at a prime rate plus 10 or at our option an adjusted libor rate for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus 15 in each case subject to certain conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreement the revolving credit agreement also contains financial and nonfinancial covenants that are substantially similar to the covenants in the term credit agreement described above the proceeds from the loans under the facility are to be used for working capital and general business purposes letters of credit are to be used to support our business operations as of december 31 2018 we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the facility as of december 31 2018 we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in the revolving credit agreement 

stock repurchase plan in may 2016 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan allowing for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in open market transactions at prevailing market prices in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws including rule 10b51 programs since the initial authorization of the stock repurchase plan our board of directors has amended and extended the stock repurchase plan from time to time on february 13 2018 we announced our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 1000 million of common stock most recently on november 20 2018 we announced our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 1500 million of our common stock our stock repurchase plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time the actual timing number and value of shares repurchased depends on a number of factors including the market price of our common stock general market and economic conditions the shares withheld for taxes associated with the vesting of restricted stock and other corporate considerations 

during the year ended december 31 2018 we repurchased an aggregate of 1108885 shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of 1254 million including 186165 shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations for certain employees upon the vesting of restricted stock as discussed below as of december 31 2018 there was 1620 million available for repurchases the stock repurchase plan will expire on november 19 2020 

withholding shares to cover taxes  during the year ended december 31 2018 we withheld 186165 shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to the delivery of vested shares of restricted stock to certain employees our payment of the taxes on behalf of those employees resulted in a cash expenditure of 202 million and as such we generally subtract the amounts attributable to such withheld shares from the aggregate amount available for future purchases under our stock repurchase plan 

cash flow analysis

our cash flows from operating activities have historically been significantly impacted by profitability implementation revenues received but deferred our investments in sales and marketing initiatives to drive growth and research and development our ability to meet future liquidity needs will be driven by our operating performance and the extent of continued investment in our operations failure to generate sufficient revenues and related cash flows could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our liquidity needs and achieve our business objectives

as our business grows we expect our capital expenditures and our investment activity to continue to increase although we completed construction of our fourth headquarters building in the second quarter of 2018 we are now focused on the planning and design of our new texas operations facility in grapevine texas capital expenditures related to the construction of the facility are expected to begin in the first half of 2019 for the year ending december 31 2019 we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of total revenues to be consistent with capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2018 depending on certain growth opportunities we may choose to accelerate investments in sales and marketing acquisitions technology and services actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our future revenues cash from operating activities and the level of expenditures in all areas of our business 

as part of our payroll and payroll tax filing services we collect funds from our clients for federal state and local employment taxes which we remit to the appropriate tax authorities we invest these funds in money market funds demand deposit accounts 

 

 

commercial paper and certificates of deposit from which we earn interest income during the period between their receipt and disbursement 

our cash flows from investing and financing activities are influenced by the amount of funds held for clients which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter the balance of the funds we hold depends on our clients’ payroll calendars and therefore such balance changes from period to period in accordance with the timing of each payroll cycle 

our cash flows from financing activities are also affected by the extent to which we use available cash to purchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase plan as well as restricted stock vesting events that result in net share settlements and the company paying withholding taxes on behalf of certain employees

the following table summarizes the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016

 



 

operating activities

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2018 primarily consisted of payments received from our clients and interest earned on funds held for clients cash used in operating activities primarily consisted of personnelrelated expenditures to support the growth and infrastructure of our business these payments included costs of operations advertising and other sales and marketing efforts it infrastructure development product research and development and security and administrative costs compared to the year ended december 31 2017 our operating cash flows for the year ended december 31 2018 were positively impacted by the growth of our business

investing activities

cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december 31 2018 increased from the prior year period due to the impact of 4175 million of changes in funds held for clients and a 143 million increase in proceeds from maturities of shortterm investments from funds held for clients partially offset by a 788 million increase in purchases of shortterm investments from funds held for clients and a 05 million increase in cash used for purchases of property and equipment primarily related to the development of additional technology and purchases of other assets

cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december 31 2017 decreased from the prior year period due to the impact of 2417 million of changes in funds held for clients a 156 million increase in purchases of property and equipment and a 03 million decrease in proceeds from sale of property and equipment partially offset by a 1251 million increase in proceeds from maturities of shortterm investments from funds held for clients and a 476 million decrease in purchases of shortterm investments from funds held for clients 

financing activities

cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december 31 2018 decreased from the prior year period due to the impact of 3524 million of changes in client funds obligation which is due to the timing of receipts from our clients and payments made to our clients’ employees and applicable taxing authorities on their behalf financing cash flows were also impacted by a 483 million increase in open market repurchases of common stock and a 409 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt these cash flows used in financing activities were partially offset by a 344 million decrease in principal payments on longterm debt a 126 million decrease in withholding taxes paid related to net share settlements a 08 million decrease in debt extinguishment costs and a 03 million decrease in the payment of debt issuance costs

cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december 31 2017 increased from the prior year period due to the impact of 694 million of changes in client funds obligation which is due to the timing of receipts from our clients and payments made to our clients’ employees and applicable taxing authorities on their behalf financing cash flows were also impacted by the 359 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt these cash flows provided by financing activities were 

 

 

partially offset by the 344 million increase in principal payments on longterm debt related to our previous loan agreements a 213 million increase in open market repurchases of common stock an 184 million increase in withholding taxes paid related to net share settlements 08 million in deb t extinguishment costs and a 03 million increase in the payment of debt issuance costs 

contractual obligations

our principal commitments primarily consist of longterm debt and leases for office space we disclose our longterm debt in note 5 and our commitments and contingencies in note 12 in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

as of december 31 2018 the future noncancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows

 

 



 

we plan to continue to lease additional office space to support our growth in addition many of our existing lease agreements provide us with the option to renew when applicable our future operating lease obligations include payments due during any renewal period provided for in the lease where the lease imposes a penalty for failure to renew

the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum services to be used fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above

offbalance sheet arrangements

as of december 31 2018 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that may be material to investors

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results may materially differ from these estimates made by management under different assumptions and conditions

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are described below accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations

revenue recognition

revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to for those goods or services substantially all of our revenues are comprised of revenue from contracts with clients sales and other applicable taxes are excluded from revenues

recurring revenues are derived primarily from our talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for form ﬁlings and delivery of client payroll checks and reports talent acquisition includes our applicant tracking candidate tracker background check onboarding everify and tax credit services applications time and labor management includes time and attendance schedulingschedule exchange timeoff requests labor allocation labor management reportspush reporting and geofencinggeotracking payroll includes our payroll and tax management 

 

 

paycom pay expense management garni shment management and gl concierge applications talent management includes our employee selfservice compensation budgeting performance management executive dashboard and paycom learning and course content applications hr management includes our docum ent and task management government and compliance beneﬁts administration cobra administration personnel action forms surveys and enhanced aca applications 

the performance obligations related to recurring revenues are satisfied during each client’s payroll period with the agreedupon fee being charged and collected as part of our processing of the client’s payroll recurring revenues are recognized at the conclusion of processing of each client’s payroll period when each respective payroll client is billed collectability is reasonably assured as the fees are collected through an automated clearing house as part of the client’s payroll cycle or through direct wire transfer which minimizes the default risk 

the contract period for substantially all contracts associated with these revenues is one month due to the fact that both we and the client have the unilateral right to terminate a wholly unperformed contract without compensating the other party by providing 30 days’ notice of termination our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications for clients who purchase multiple applications due to the shortterm nature of our contracts we do not believe it is meaningful to separately assess and identify whether or not each application potentially represents its own individual performance obligation as the revenue generated from each application is recognized within the same month as the revenue from the core payroll application similarly we do not believe it is meaningful to individually determine the standalone selling price for each application we consider the total price charged to a client in a given period to be indicative of the standalone selling price as the total amount charged is within a reasonable range of prices typically charged for our goods and services for comparable classes of client groups 

implementation and other revenues consist of nonrefundable upfront conversion fees which are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client setup as well as revenues from the sale of time clocks as part of our employee time and attendance services although these revenues are related to our recurring revenues they represent distinct performance obligations 

implementation activities primarily represent administrative activities that allow us to fulfill future performance obligations for our clients and for accounting recognition purposes do not represent services transferred to the client however the nonrefundable upfront fee charged to our clients results in an implied performance obligation in the form of a material right to the client related to the client’s option to renew at the end of each 30day contract period further given that all other services within the contract are sold at a total price indicative of the standalone selling price coupled with the fact that the upfront fees are consistent with upfront fees charged in similar contracts that we have with clients the standalone selling price of the client’s option to renew approximates the dollar amount of the nonrefundable upfront fee the nonrefundable upfront fee is typically included on the client’s first invoice and is deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated renewal period ie the tenyear estimated client life 

revenue from the sale of time clocks is recognized when control is transferred to the client upon delivery of the product we estimate the standalone selling price for the time clocks by maximizing the use of observable inputs such as our specific pricing practices for time clocks 

goodwill and other intangible assets

goodwill is not amortized but we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually or earlier if at the reporting unit level an indicator of impairment arises the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows if impairment exists a writedown to fair value is recorded our business is largely homogeneous and as a result goodwill is associated with one reporting unit we have selected june 30 as our annual goodwill impairment testing date and determined there was no impairment as of june 30 2018 for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 there were no indicators of impairment intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives

impairment of longlived assets

longlived assets including intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset we have determined that there is no impairment of longlived assets for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016

restricted stock 

we measure noncash stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock awards issued by using a monte carlo simulation model this model considers various subjective assumptions as inputs and represent our best estimates which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment as it relates to market volatilities the historical volatility of our stock price riskfree rates and expected life the valuation model also 

 

 

incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data determining these assumptions is subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock awards and the associated compensation expense refer to note 10 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stockbased compensation awards

nongaap financial measures

management uses adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income as supplemental measures to review and assess the performance of our core business operations and for planning purposes we define i adjusted ebitda as net income plus interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization noncash stockbased compensation expense loss on early repayment of debt certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap and ii nongaap net income as net income plus noncash stockbased compensation expense certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations loss on early repayment of debt and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap all of which are adjusted for the effect of income taxes adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income are metrics that provide investors with greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking we believe these metrics are useful to investors because they facilitate comparisons of our core business operations across periods on a consistent basis as well as comparisons with the results of peer companies many of which use similar nongaap financial measures to supplement results under us gaap in addition adjusted ebitda is a measure that provides useful information to management about the amount of cash available for reinvestment in our business repurchasing common stock and other purposes management believes that the nongaap measures presented in this form 10k when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with us gaap provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business and performance

adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income are not measures of financial performance under us gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income which we consider to be the most directly comparable us gaap measure adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing our operating performance you should not consider adjusted ebitda or nongaap net income in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other consolidated statements of income data prepared in accordance with us gaap adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income may not be comparable to similar titled measures of other companies and other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate sensitivity

cash and cash equivalents totaled 457 million as of december 31 2018 these amounts are invested primarily in demand deposit accounts money market funds and certificates of deposit we consider all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less and secregistered money market mutual funds to be cash equivalents the primary objectives of our investing activities are capital preservation meeting our liquidity needs and with respect to investing client funds generating interest income while maintaining the safety of principal we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes

our cash equivalents are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates the market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates

as of december 31 2018 an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points would not have had a material effect on our operating results or financial condition

in december 2017 we entered into the term credit agreement pursuant to which the lenders parties thereto have agreed to make term loans to us in an aggregate principal amount of up to 600 million which will mature on september 7 2025 as described elsewhere in this form 10k the term loans bear interest at our option at either a a prime rate plus 10 or b an adjusted libor rate for the interest period in effect for such term loan plus 15 as a result we are exposed to increased interest rate risk to mitigate the increased interest rate risk we entered into the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate swap agreement has effectively fixed our rate at 40 eliminating a portion of the variable rate and coinciding interest rate risk associated with the term loans

in february 2018 we entered into the revolving credit agreement which provides for a credit facility in the aggregate amount of 500 million which may be increased to up to 1000 million subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying certain other conditions as described elsewhere in this form 10k borrowings under the facility will generally bear interest at a prime rate plus 10 or at our option an adjusted libor rate for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus 15 as of december 31 2018 we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the facility to the extent we make draws under the facility in the future we may be exposed to increased interest rate risk

overview

we are a leading provider of a comprehensive cloudbased hcm software solution delivered as saas we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions including talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and human resources “hr” management applications our userfriendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees enabling selfmanagement of their hcm activities in the cloud which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity

organizations need sophisticated flexible and intuitive applications that can quickly adapt to their evolving hcm requirements streamline their hr processes and systems and enable them to control costs we believe that the hcm needs of most organizations are currently served either by multiple providers in an attempt to replicate a comprehensive saas product or to a lesser extent by legacy providers offering outdated onpremise products these approaches often result in challenges with system integration and data integrity low scalability high costs extended delivery times and large upfront capital requirements

because our solution was developed inhouse and is based on a single platform there is no need to integrate update or access multiple databases which are common issues with competitor offerings that use multiple thirdparty systems in order to link together their hcm offerings additionally our solution maintains data integrity for accurate actionable and realtime analytics and business intelligence and helps clients minimize the risk of compliance errors due to inaccurate or missing information we deliver featurerich applications while maintaining excellence in information security and quality management standards as evidenced by our international organization for standardization “iso” certifications 

we sell our solution directly through our internally trained clientfocused and highly skilled sales force based in offices across the united states as a part of our client retention effort a specialist within a dedicated team is assigned to each client to provide industryleading personalized service we have over 20000 clients none of which constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 we believe that as a result of our focus on client retention we enjoy high client satisfaction as evidenced by an annual revenue retention rate of 91 from existing clients for each of the three years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 we believe our revenue retention rate understates our client loyalty because this rate also includes former clients that were acquired or otherwise ceased operations

 

 

we were founded in 1998 since our founding we have focused on providing an innovative saas hcm solution as of december 31 2017 we had 2548 employees across the united states for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 our revenues were 4330 million 3291 million and 2247 million respectively representing yearoveryear growth in revenues of approximately 32 and 4 7 respectively we currently derive the majority of our revenues from payroll processing we are able to determine revenues from payroll processing because all of our clients are required to utilize our payroll application in order to access our other ap plications we generally do not separately track our revenues across our other applications because we often sell applications in various groupings and configurations for a single price we realized net income of 668 million 438 million and 209 mill ion for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively

softwareasaservice delivery model 

our saas delivery model allows clients with geographically dispersed and mobile workforces to operate more efficiently and allows these clients to implement access and use our clientoriented internet solution on demand and remotely through standard web browsers smart phones tablets and other webenabled devices our saas solution reduces the time risk headcount and costs associated with installing and maintaining applications for onpremise products within the information technology “it” infrastructure of our clients

secure cloudbased architecture

our cloudbased architecture allows our solution to be implemented remotely with minimal client interaction updates such as software enhancements and newly developed applications can be deployed without client interaction disruption or involvement allowing our clients to make a smaller investment in hardware personnel implementation time and consulting additionally we own and maintain all of the infrastructure technology to host our solution and to maximize system availability for clients our focus and investment in technology and data security has been recognized with isoiec 270012013 certified security standards that provide our clients with a “bestinclass” level of data security

scalability to grow with our clients

our solution is highly scalable we serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one employee to many thousands of employees although our target client size range is 50 to 2000 employees we calculate the number of clients’ employees based on parent company grouping our clients are able to use the same solution while their businesses grow by deploying applications asneeded in realtime pricing is determined by employee headcount and the number of applications utilized enabling our clients to align hcm spending with their evolving hcm needs as compared to traditional hcm products that require clients to migrate to new software as they grow but retain fixed costs even if the client shrinks in size

efficient and productive research and development

we believe that we benefit from a competitive advantage with our research and development investments people and processes early investments in our proprietary cloudbased architecture enable us to develop and deploy applications in a timely and costeffective manner we have also chosen to base our research and development team in oklahoma and texas which we believe provides us with highquality talent at a lower cost compared to other locations in the united states where there is more competition for technology talent these strategic decisions have enabled us to have a highly productive research and development function

our strategy for growth

our strategy is to continue to establish our solution as the hcm industry standard by increasing our presence in existing markets and expanding into additional markets we intend to open 10 to 14 new sales offices over the next two years as well as potentially expand over the longer term into international markets we will also execute our strategy for growth by targeting larger clients as well as strengthening and extending our solution

increase our presence in existing markets

we believe a significant market opportunity exists to increase our presence within markets where we currently have a sales office each sales office is typically staffed with one sales team with each team comprised of a sales manager and approximately six to eight other sales professionals although we have a sales office in 35 of the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas “msas” in the united states based on july 2016 us census bureau estimates only five of these msas are currently served by multiple paycom sales teams in addition to expanding into new markets we plan to further penetrate and more effectively capture existing markets by adding sales offices and increasing the number of sales teams in such markets since our initial public offering “ipo” in april 2014 we have expanded our presence within three msas that were already served by at least one paycom sales team by opening new sales offices in brooklyn chicago long island and pasadena 

expand into additional markets

we plan to continue expanding our sales capability by opening sales offices in certain metropolitan areas where we currently have no sales teams since our ipo in april 2014 we have expanded into eleven new markets by opening new sales offices in cincinnati cleveland kansas city milwaukee nashville pittsburgh richmond sacramento salt lake city san antonio and stamford 

we have historically selected new locations based on potential client and employee demographics as well as business density when opening a new sales office we typically relocate a proven sales manager from an existing territory who then recruits a team of high performing sales representatives it typically takes a new sales office 24 months to reach maturity 

 

 

enlarge our existing client relationships 

we dedicate our resources to helping our clients facilitate their goals whether through helping them execute better hiring decisions manage compensation more effectively or simply operate more efficiently we believe a significant growth opportunity exists in selling additional applications to our current clients many clients have subsequently deployed additional applications as they recognize the benefits of our comprehensive solution as we extend and enhance the functionality of our solution we will continue to invest in initiatives to increase the adoption of our solution and maintain our high levels of client satisfaction

target larger clients

the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations and increased the number of applications we offer based on our total revenues we have grown at an approximately 42 cagr from january 1 2013 through december 31 2017 our solution requires no adjustment to serve larger clients we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost to us to further capitalize on this opportunity we intend to continue targeting larger businesses opportunistically where our current sales model is effective

maintain our leadership in innovation by strengthening and extending our solution

our ability to develop and deploy new applications and updates rapidly and costeffectively has been integral to the results that we have achieved to date we intend to continue extending the functionality and range of our solution in the future our development efforts are performed exclusively inhouse and are heavily based upon proactive research and client input we are focusing our investments on the development of new applications enhancements and learning courses that are responsive to the needs of our clients which are garnered through ongoing client interaction and collaboration

our applications 

our hcm solution offers a full suite of applications that generally fall within the following categories talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management

talent acquisition

 



 

 

time and labor management 

 



 

 

payroll 



talent management

 



 

 

hr management 

 



our clients

we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry we have over 20000 clients or approximately 11000 clients based on parent company grouping none of which constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 we stored data for nearly 33 million persons employed by our clients during the year ended december 31 2017

many small to midsized companies can typically make the decision to adopt our solution more quickly than larger companies which we believe results in a shorter sales cycle and more closely corresponds to our target sales cycle of 30 to 90 days as a result of the nature and size of our clientele we maintain a diversified client base and very low revenue concentration among our clients we believe however that larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost as we attract clients at the higher end of our target client size range we may face longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales

competition

the market for hcm solutions is rapidly evolving highly competitive and subject to changing technology shifting client needs and frequent introduction of new products and services our competitors range from small regional firms to large wellestablished international firms with multiple product offerings

we compete with firms that provide hcm solutions by various means many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software but as demand for greater flexibility and access to information grows we believe there will be increased competition in the delivery of hcm cloudbased solutions by other saas providers our competitors offer hcm solutions that may overlap with one 

 

 

several or all categories of applications offered by our solution our talent acquisition and talent management applications compete primarily with cornerstone ondemand inc oracle corporation sap se and workday inc our payroll applications including payroll processing compete primarily with automatic data processing inc “adp” ceridian hcm inc “ceridian” concur technologies inc intuit inc paychex inc paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc our hr management applications compete primarily with adp ceridian oracle corporation paychex inc paylocity holding corporation sap se and workday inc our time and labor management applications compete primarily with adp ceridian kronos incorporated paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software grou p inc our larger competitors compete with us across multiple segments in addition our hcm solution continues to face competition from inhouse payroll and hr systems and departments as well as hr systems and software sold by thirdparty vendors 

competition in the hcm solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation breadth of service application offering and price the importance of these factors depends on the size of the business price tends to be the most important factor of competition for smaller businesses with fewer employees while the scope of features and customization is more important to larger businesses regardless of a company’s size another important factor is the implementation experience as all organizations are seeking a streamlined and simplified process 

sales and marketing

we sell our solution exclusively through our captive sales force substantially all of whom have a fouryear college degree we typically recruit sales candidates who have sales experience in nonhcm industries or with respect to candidates recruited directly from colleges and universities who have demonstrated an aptitude for sales our sales force is comprised of inside sales and field sales personnel who are organized geographically and client relations representatives “crrs” who sell additional applications to existing clients as of the filing of this form 10k we have 46 sales teams located in 26 states and plan to open additional sales offices to further expand our presence in the us market

we provide our sales force with an intensive sixweek training course that includes at least one week of training at our headquarters in oklahoma city our unique training program includes instruction in accounting business metrics application features and tax matters relevant to our target market and we believe it fosters loyalty and helps maintain our corporate culture our training continues for our sales force through weekly inoffice strategy sessions and leadership development training executive sales representatives are also required to attend inperson quarterly conferences to share best practices and receive legal and business updates

when a new client processes payroll with us for an entire month or an existing client purchases and then utilizes a new application for one month our sales representative or crr receives a onetime commission based upon an estimate of future annual revenues from such client executive sales representatives receive a higher commission rate and base salary based upon both current year and lifetodate realized sales respectively

we generate client leads accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs that target senior finance and hr executives technology professionals and senior business leaders of companies that perform hcm functions inhouse or outsource these functions to one of our competitors our marketing programs include







in addition to managing client relationships our crrs are focused on expanding the number of applications our clients purchase from us by introducing them to additional applications our crrs call upon select clients periodically and are paid a nonrecurring commission on any additional sales they generate

technology operations and security

technology

our multitenant architecture enables us to deliver our solution across our client base with a single instance of our solution while securely partitioning access to our clients’ respective application data because a single version of our solution is developed supported and deployed across all of our clients updates are delivered to all of our clients at the same time making it easier to scale our solution as our number of clients and their respective employee headcounts increase

we maintain multiple loadbalanced internet lines serviced by multiple networks to provide our clients continuous access to our solution and their stored data we back up our client data at regular intervals utilizing live replication snapshots and cold archive methods of backup and manually monitor backup success and failure regularly our server cluster and database servers have redundant “hot swappable” disks to ensure continuous service in the event of a disk failure

 

 

operations 

we physically host our solution for our clients in two secure data center facilities located in oklahoma and texas all of our critical systems are fully redundant and backedup in realtime to these facilities physical security includes idoriented access control alarm systems and manned 24houraday camera monitoring by our security guards server facilities also have environmental monitoring and extensive environmental controls such as heat and fire protection moisture temperature and humidity sensors backup power supply and exterior reinforced concrete walls

security

we maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of our clients’ data during the regular course of business we receive client data through our online system that we in turn process record and store following isoiec 2700012013 certified controls and procedures all communications with our servers that might contain sensitive information are encrypted before they leave the network and our servers are configured to only allow highgrade encryption algorithms

we strictly regulate and limit all access to servers and networks at each of our facilities local network access is restricted by our authenticated server using access control lists and remote network access is restricted by a firewall which provides no accessible route from external networks to systems within our local network we also employ network and host intrusion detection and prevention sensors throughout our infrastructure systems that monitor that infrastructure and alert our security department of cybersecurity issues a system for managing and installing patches for unsecure thirdparty applications and highly restricted access to the internet for anyone who has access to client data our information security department regularly performs penetration testing and we retain a thirdparty penetration testing company to conduct penetration tests and periodic audits to identify and remediate any issues

our applications are secured using multiple libraries and secure coding practices our it infrastructure is secured and monitored using a number of best practices and tools at multiple layers of the physical and logical network this security is also continually monitored by our information security department all of our operations employees work in either our oklahoma or texas locations and with the exception of certain it personnel are not permitted to work remotely

software development

our application development team works closely with our clients to enhance our existing application offerings and develop new applications this process is led by experienced product managers who oversee the evolution of their respective applications within a focused timeframe of innovation and cultivation in order to deliver the welldeveloped applications and enhancements desired by our clients our product managers many of whom are former hr executives are proactive in their approach to assigning development requests based on research trends and user feedback a key element of our development process is the oneonone personal interaction between clients and our crrs through whom our clients personally suggest new applications and features

we develop our solution from the “ground up” with our internal development and engineering teams our development and engineering teams and our employees conceive new applications and enhancements review requests schedule development in order of priority and subsequently develop the applications or enhancements our new applications and enhancements are independently reviewed by the quality assurance team in accordance with our software development process before being fully implemented any enhancements to our applications are released on a monthly scheduled release date to coordinate the communication and release to our clients

capitalized software development expenses which include compensation for employees directly associated with development projects were 158 million 88 million and 43 million for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively

client service

we are committed to providing industryleading clientcentered service for this reason we assign each client a specialist within a dedicated team this oneonone service is a key part of our client service model and helps to ensure that we are delivering an industryleading solution and maintaining high client satisfaction the primary elements of our client service model include the following

streamlined setup and onboarding

after electing to deploy our solution a new client begins our onboarding process with assistance from a team of new client setup specialists and the sales professional responsible for obtaining the client’s business in addition we also have a team of transition specialists whose job it is to ensure that the process is performed smoothly data is collected properly and all relevant employees are fully trained on the system this team works closely with the client until the client is capable of managing our solution independently at which time responsibility for the client relationship is transferred to our dedicated crrs and service specialists unlike certain of our competitors we do not outsource any of our onboarding efforts

 

 

dedicated service specialists 

after completing the onboarding process each client is assigned to a services specialist within a dedicated team clients can then contact their dedicated services specialist or a team member if any issues or questions arise these specialists provide personalized service with actual knowledge of the clients’ business needs when appropriate client questions can be elevated to the specialists with the appropriate application regulatory or tax expertise in addition our crrs proactively contact our clients to ensure satisfaction with our solution and introduce additional applications

expert level service

our client specialists are trained across all of our applications to ensure that they can provide comprehensive expertlevel service our client service is iso 90012008 certified and helps support a high client retention rate

regulatory and certifications

we are subject to varying degrees of regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide services local laws and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement differ significantly among those jurisdictions these regulations and laws cover among others information privacy

data privacy has become a significant issue in the united states and in other countries the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future many federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations affecting or regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information in the united states these include for example rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca and state breach notification laws

we voluntarily obtain thirdparty security examinations relating to security and data privacy in accordance with statement on standards for attestation engagements “ssae” no 16 reporting on controls at a service organization our ssae examination is conducted every six months by one of the four largest independent international auditing firms and addresses among other areas our physical and environmental safeguards for production data centers data availability and integrity procedures change management procedures and logical security procedures

in october 2016 we renewed a certification based on isoiec 270012013 criteria a security standard for information security management systems published by iso covering our production quality assurance and implementation environments this independent assessment of our conformity to the iso 27001 standard includes assessing security risks designing and implementing comprehensive security controls and adopting an information security management process to meet security needs on an ongoing basis the certification is valid until december 2019 with continuing assessments taking place annually

in april 2017 we renewed a certification based on iso 90012008 criteria a standard for the implementation of quality management processes published by iso covering our activities required to create and deliver our solution this independent assessment of our conformity to the iso 90012008 standard includes assessing the design and implementation of quality objectives to meet delivery standards on an ongoing basis the certification is valid until september 2018 with continuing assessments taking place annually

intellectual property

we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights we also have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we do not have any patents or patent applications pending

seasonality

our revenues are seasonal in nature recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs such as bonuses for our clients because payroll forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year first quarter revenues and margins are generally higher than in subsequent quarters further beginning in the first quarter of 2016 we began generating additional revenues as a result of the enactment of the aca as many clients began complying with filing requirements for forms 1094 and 1095 we anticipate that our revenues will continue to exhibit this seasonal pattern related to aca form filings for so long as the aca or replacement legislation includes employer reporting requirements in addition we often experience increased revenues during the fourth quarter due to unscheduled payroll runs for our clients that occur before the end of the year therefore we expect the seasonality of our revenue cycle to decrease to the extent clients utilize more of our nonpayroll applications

 

 

employees 

our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees is critical to our continued success we invest heavily in our training and leadership development programs to encourage the development and promotion of our employees as of december 31 2017 we employed 2548 people none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

facilities

our corporate headquarters is an approximately 250000squarefoot campus located on over 30 acres of companyowned property in oklahoma city oklahoma in addition to housing a fully redundant data center at our corporate headquarters we operate another fully redundant data center at a leased property near dallas texas we also lease a disaster recovery site in downtown oklahoma city 

we also lease offices in arizona california colorado connecticut florida georgia illinois indiana maryland massachusetts michigan minnesota missouri new jersey new york north carolina ohio oklahoma oregon pennsylvania tennessee texas utah virginia washington and wisconsin we believe that these facilities are suitable for our current operations and upon the expiration of the terms of the leases we believe we could renew these leases or find suitable space elsewhere on acceptable terms

segment information

we operate in a single operating segment and a single reporting segment operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker function which is fulfilled by our chief executive officer in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance our chief executive officer allocates resources and assesses performance based upon financial information at the consolidated level since we operate in one operating segment all required financial segment information is presented in the consolidated financial statements

risk factors 

tableend

the risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this form 10k including those risks identified in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” describe examples of risks uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statement if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect actual outcomes may vary materially from those included in this form 10k

changes in laws government regulations and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

many of our applications are designed to assist our clients in complying with government regulations that continually change the introduction of new regulatory or licensing requirements or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations could increase our cost of doing business and changing regulatory requirements may make the introduction of new applications and enhancements more costly or more timeconsuming than we currently anticipate or could prevent the introduction of new applications and enhancements by us altogether changes in laws regulations or policies could also affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for certain of our existing applications which would result in decreased revenues further we may spend time and money developing new applications and enhancements that due to regulatory changes become unnecessary prior to being released in addition any failure to educate and assist our clients with respect to new or revised legislation that impacts them could have an adverse effect on our reputation and any failure to modify our applications or develop new applications in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

 

in addition the future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the internet as a primary medium for commerce communication and business federal state and foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet as a commercial medium changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our applications in order to comply with these changes in addition government agencies or pri vate organizations may impose taxes fees or other charges for accessing the internet or commerce conducted via the internet these laws or charges could limit the growth of internetrelated commerce or communications generally or could result in reduction s in the demand for internetbased applications such as ours 

if our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to our clients’ or their employees’ sensitive data is otherwise obtained our solution may not be perceived as being secure clients may reduce the use of or stop using our solution our ability to attract new clients may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities

our solution involves the collection storage and transmission of clients’ and their employees’ confidential and proprietary information including personal identifying information as well as financial and payroll data hcm software is often targeted in cyberattacks including computer viruses worms phishing attacks malicious software programs and other information security breaches which could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our clients’ sensitive data or otherwise disrupt our clients’ or other third parties’ business operations if cybercriminals are able to circumvent our security measures or if we are unable to detect an intrusion into our systems and contain such intrusion in a reasonable amount of time our clients’ sensitive data may be compromised

certain of our employees have access to sensitive information about our clients’ employees while we conduct background checks of our employees and limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls resulting in a security breach 

although we have security measures in place to protect client information and prevent data loss and other security breaches these measures could be breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently we may not be able to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative or protective measures while we currently maintain a cyber liability insurance policy cyber liability insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our cyber liability insurance policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention from our business and operations

any actual or perceived breach of our security could damage our reputation cause existing clients to discontinue the use of our solution prevent us from attracting new clients or subject us to thirdparty lawsuits regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

any damage failure or disruption of our saas network infrastructure or data centers could impair our ability to effectively provide our solution harm our reputation and adversely affect our business

our saas network infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations our clients access our solution through standard web browsers smart phones tablets and other webenabled devices and depend on us for fast and reliable access to our solution we serve all of our clients from our two fully redundant data centers located in oklahoma and texas our saas network infrastructure and data centers are vulnerable to damage failure and disruption 

in the future we may experience issues with our computing and communications infrastructure or data centers caused by the following factors

















if our saas network infrastructure or our clients’ ability to access our solution is interrupted client and employee data from recent transactions may be permanently lost and we could be exposed to significant claims by clients particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds payable to employees further any adverse changes in service 

 

 

levels at our data centers resulting from dam age to or failure of our data centers could result in disruptions in our services any significant instances of system downtime or performance problems at our data centers could negatively affect our reputation and ability to attract new clients prevent us from gaining new or additional business from our current clients or cause our current clients to terminate their use of our solution  which would adversely impact our revenues in addition if our network infrastructure and data centers fail t o support increased capacity due to growth in our business our clients may experience interruptions in the availability of our solution this might reduce our revenues cause us to issue refunds to clients or adversely affect our retention of existing cli ents which could have a negative impact on our business operating results or financial condition 

privacy concerns and laws or other regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our applications

our applications are subject to various complex government laws and regulations on the federal state and local levels including those governing data privacy which has become a significant issue globally the regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future many federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information in the united states these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca federal and state labor and employment laws and state data breach notification laws failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition

in addition to government regulation privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different selfregulatory standards because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws are still uncertain it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our solution any failure to comply with government regulations that apply to our applications including privacy and data protection laws could subject us to liability in addition to the possibility of fines lawsuits and other claims we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our solution which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition any inability to adequately address privacy concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws regulations and policies could result in additional cost and liability to us damage our reputation inhibit sales and adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

furthermore privacy concerns may cause our clients’ employees to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our clients and their employees to use our applications effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our applications in certain industries all of these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the ability of our clients to process handle store use and transmit demographic and personal information from their employees which could reduce demand for our applications

the market in which we participate is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected

the market for hcm software is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented we expect competition to intensify in the future with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants many of our current and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition longer operating histories more established relationships in the industry and significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as a result some of these competitors may be able to















 

 

some of our principal competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures similarly some competitors offer different billing terms which has resulted in pressures on our billing terms if we are unable to maintain our pricing levels and our billing terms our operating results would be negatively impacted in addition pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales reduced margins losses or the failure of our solution to maintain widespread market acceptance any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

we compete with firms that provide hcm solutions by various means many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software but as demand for greater flexibility and access to information grows we believe there will be increased competition in the delivery of hcm cloudbased solutions by other saas providers our competitors offer hcm solutions that overlap with one several or all categories of applications that we offer our talent acquisition and talent management applications compete primarily with cornerstone ondemand inc oracle corporation sap se and workday inc our payroll applications including payroll processing compete primarily with adp ceridian concur technologies inc intuit inc paychex inc paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc our hr management applications compete primarily with adp ceridian oracle corporation paychex inc paylocity holding corporation sap se and workday inc our time and labor management applications compete primarily with adp ceridian kronos incorporated paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc most of our larger competitors compete with us across multiple application categories in addition our hcm solution continues to face competition from inhouse payroll and hr systems as well as hr systems and software sold by thirdparty vendors

competition in the hcm solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness application quality and reputation breadth of service and product offering and price many of our competitors have established marketing relationships access to larger client bases and major distribution agreements with consultants software vendors and distributors in addition some competitors may offer software that addresses one or a limited number of hcm functions at a lower price point or with greater depth than our solution further some potential clients particularly large enterprises may elect to develop their own internal solutions if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected

our financial results may fluctuate due to many factors some of which may be beyond our control

our results of operations including the levels of our revenues costs of revenues administrative expenses operating income cash flow and deferred revenue may vary significantly in the future and the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance fluctuations in our financial results may negatively impact the value of our common stock our financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control and as a result may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate from period to period include without limitation





























 

 









our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth and organizational change if we fail to manage such growth and change effectively we may be unable to execute our business plan maintain high levels of service or adequately address competitive challenges

we have experienced and may continue to experience rapid growth in our headcount and operations which has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management operational and financial resources for example our headcount has grown from 523 employees as of december 31 2011 to 2548 employees as of december 31 2017 and we have expanded from 20 sales teams as of december 31 2011 to 46 sales teams as of the filing of this form 10k we have also experienced significant growth in the number of clients and transactions and the amount of client and employee data that our infrastructure supports finally our organizational structure and recording systems and procedures are becoming more complex as we improve our operational financial and management controls our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth and organizational change effectively to manage the expected growth of our headcount and operations we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures the failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulties or delays in obtaining clients selling additional applications to our clients declines in quality or client satisfaction of our applications increases in costs difficulties in introducing new applications or other operational difficulties any of which could adversely affect our business by impairing our ability to retain and attract clients or sell additional applications to our existing clients 

further we need to continue to expand our sales force and support team members in order to grow our client base and increase our revenues but our ability to add additional offices may be constrained by the willingness and availability of qualified personnel to staff and manage any new offices and our success in recruiting and training sales personnel in those new offices if our expansion efforts are unsuccessful our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our deployment or technical support services or if our solution fails to perform properly

our business depends on our ability to satisfy our clients both with respect to our applications and the technical support provided to help our clients use the applications that address the needs of their businesses we use our inhouse deployment personnel to implement and configure our solution and provide support to our clients if a client is not satisfied with the quality of our solution or the applications delivered or the support provided we could incur additional costs to address the situation our profitability might be negatively affected and the client’s dissatisfaction with our deployment service could damage our ability to sell additional applications to that client in addition our sales process is highly dependent on the reputation of our solution and applications and on positive recommendations from our existing clients our clients have no obligation to continue to use our applications and may choose not to continue to use our applications at the same or higher level of service if at all in the past some of our clients have elected not to continue to use our applications moreover our clients generally have the right to cancel their agreements with us for any or no reason by providing 30 days’ prior written notice any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality technical support could adversely affect client retention our reputation our ability to sell our applications to existing and prospective clients and as a result our business operating results or financial condition 

further our solution is inherently complex and may in the future contain or develop undetected defects or errors any defects in our applications could adversely affect our reputation impair our ability to sell our applications in the future and result in significant costs to us the costs incurred in correcting any application defects may be substantial and could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition any defects in functionality or that cause interruptions in the availability of our applications could result in 













 

 

because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our applications could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain i naccuracies that our clients regard as significant our clients might assert claims against us in the future alleging that they suffered damages due to a defect error or other failure of our solution our errors and omissions insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention any failures in the p erformance of our solution could harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients which would have an adverse impact on our business operating results or financial condition 

if we are not able to develop enhancements and new applications keep pace with technological developments or respond to future disruptive technologies we might not remain competitive and our business could be adversely affected

our continued success will depend on our ability to adapt and innovate in order to attract new clients and increase revenues from existing clients we need to enhance add new features to and improve our existing applications and introduce new applications the success of any enhancements or new features and applications depends on several factors including timely completion introduction and market acceptance we may expend significant time and resources developing and pursuing sales of a particular enhancement or application that may not result in revenues in the anticipated time frame or at all or may not result in revenue growth sufficient to offset increased expenses further changing legal and regulatory requirements may delay the development or introduction of enhancements or new applications or render certain of our applications obsolete if we are unable to successfully develop enhancements new features or new applications to meet client needs our business and operating results could be adversely affected

in addition because our applications are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using internet tools and protocols we will need to continuously modify and enhance our applications to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies if we are unable to respond in a timely and costeffective manner to these rapid technological developments our current and future applications may become less marketable and less competitive or even obsolete

our success is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver hcm solutions at lower prices more efficiently or more conveniently such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete

the market for our solution among large companies may be limited if these companies demand customized features and functions that we do not offer

prospective clients especially larger companies may require customized features and functions unique to their business processes that we do not offer in order to ensure we meet these requirements we may devote a significant amount of support and service resources to larger prospective clients increasing the cost and time required to complete sales with no guarantee that these prospective clients will adopt our solution further we may not be successful in implementing any customized features or functions if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we do not offer or that would be difficult for them to deploy themselves the market for our solution will be more limited and our business could be adversely affected

we are dependent on the continued service of our key executives and if we fail to retain such key executives our business could be adversely affected

we believe that our success depends in part on the continued services of our senior management team consisting of chad richison craig e boelte jeffrey d york and stacey pezold our business could be adversely affected if we fail to retain these key executives although the employment arrangements with each of our key executives contain noncompetition restrictions our business could nonetheless be adversely affected if a key executive leaves paycom and attempts to compete with us in addition we have not purchased key person life insurance on any members of our senior management team 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel including software developers and skilled it sales and marketing personnel our ability to develop and market new and existing products and in turn increase our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected

our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new applications as a result we are heavily dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified software developers and it personnel with the requisite education background and industry experience in addition to continue to execute our growth strategy we must also attract and retain qualified sales marketing and operational personnel capable of supporting a larger and more diverse client base the software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors this competition for qualified personnel may be amplified by new immigration laws or policies that could limit software companies’ ability to recruit internationally although such changes in immigration laws or policies would not have a significant direct impact on our workforce the ensuing increase in demand for software developers and it personnel could impair our ability to attract or retain skilled employees andor significantly increase our costs to do so furthermore identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use of our 

 

 

applications requires significant time expense and attention and it can take a substantial amount of time before our employees are fully trained and productive the loss of the services of a significant number of employee s could be disruptive to our development efforts which may adversely affect our business by causing us to lose clients increase operating expenses or divert management’s attention to recruit replacements for the departed employees 

certain of our operating results and financial metrics may be difficult to predict as a result of seasonality

we have historically experienced seasonality in our revenues because a significant portion of our recurring revenues relate to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 and beginning in 2016 the annual processing and filing of acarelated forms because these forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year first quarter revenues are generally higher than subsequent quarters in addition unscheduled payroll runs at the end of the year such as bonuses often result in increased revenues in the fourth quarter we expect this seasonality to continue in the future although the repeal or modification of the aca could have an impact on the seasonality of our revenues nonetheless the seasonal fluctuations in certain of our operating results and financial metrics may make such results and metrics difficult to predict

the modification or repeal of certain provisions of the aca could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we generate acarelated revenues i on an annual basis in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients and ii from clients who have purchased our enhanced aca application as part of the fixed bundled price charged per billing period on january 20 2017 president donald j trump issued an executive order stating that it is the policy of the new administration to seek the prompt repeal of the aca despite multiple efforts congress was unable to pass legislation significantly repealing or replacing the aca in 2017 but many uncertainties remain regarding its future the trump administration took additional action in october 2017 that may weaken the aca’s public health insurance marketplace and the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 enacted december 22 2017 eliminates the aca’s individual mandate penalty beginning january 1 2019 both events suggest additional action to further weaken repeal or replace the aca may occur the modification or repeal of certain provisions of the aca could harm our business operating results and financial condition if the aca is modified to eliminate the employer reporting requirements or if the aca is repealed and replaced with new legislation that does not include similar employer reporting requirements we will no longer generate revenues in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients while we generally do not track our revenues on an applicationbyapplication basis because applications are often sold in various groupings and configurations for a single price we estimate that if the aca is not modified or repealed revenues from our enhanced aca application and aca forms filings business will represent approximately 5 of total projected revenues for the year ending december 31 2018 further uncertainty regarding the potential future modification repeal or replacement of the aca could adversely affect our ability to sell our enhanced aca application to new clients

if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights our competitive advantage could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets generate reduced revenues or incur costly litigation to protect our rights

our success is dependent in part upon our intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and to protect our intellectual property rights however the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our applications and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products or services that compete with ours

we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property we have been involved in litigation in the past and litigation may be necessary in the future to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets such litigation could be costly timeconsuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights we may not be able to secure protect and enforce our intellectual property rights or control access to and the distribution of our solution and proprietary information which could affect our business

we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights

considerable intellectual property development activity exists in our industry and we expect that software developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of applications and competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps our competitors as well as a number of other entities and individuals may own or claim to own intellectual property in technology areas relating to our solution or applications in addition we may increasingly be subject to trademark infringement claims as our presence grows in the marketplace from time to time third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights a claim of infringement may also be made relating to technology that we acquire or license from third parties however we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover or may be alleged to cover some or all of our solution applications or brands

 

 

the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable and as a result any future li tigation or claim of infringement could i cause us to enter into an unfavorable royalty or license agreement pay ongoing royalties or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms ii require us to discontinue the sale of our solution or applica tions iii require us to indemnify our clients or thirdparty service providers or iv require us to expend additional development resources to redesign our solution or applications any of these outcomes could harm our business even if we were to prev ail any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business and operations 

the use of open source software in our applications may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property rights

some of our applications use software covered by open source licenses from time to time there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate such software into their products or applications as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software litigation could be costly for us to defend have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional development resources to change our applications in addition if we were to combine our applications with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain of the open source licenses be required to release the source code of our applications if we inappropriately use open source software we may be required to redesign our applications discontinue the sale of our applications or take other remedial actions which could adversely impact our business operating results or financial condition

we employ thirdparty licensed software for use in our applications and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs or reduced service levels which could adversely affect our business

our applications incorporate certain thirdparty software obtained under licenses from other companies we anticipate that we will continue to rely on such thirdparty software and development tools from third parties in the future although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the thirdparty software we currently license this may not always be the case or it may be difficult or costly to replace in addition incorporating the software used in our applications with new thirdparty software may require significant work and substantial investment of our time and resources also to the extent that our applications depend upon the successful operation of thirdparty software in conjunction with our software any undetected errors or defects in this thirdparty software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our applications delay new application introductions result in a failure of our applications and harm our reputation

the failure to develop and maintain our brand costeffectively could have an adverse effect on our business

we believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a costeffective manner is critical to achieving the widespread acceptance of our solution and is an important element in attracting new clients and retaining existing clients successful promotion of our brand depends largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful applications at competitive prices brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues and even if they do any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brand if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand we may fail to attract enough new clients or retain our existing clients to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding efforts which could have an adverse effect on our business

our outstanding indebtedness is subject to certain operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities and may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business

we have incurred indebtedness to fund certain construction projects at our corporate headquarters pursuant to the terms of our outstanding indebtedness we may not subject to certain exceptions



















 

 

in addition we are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” to fixed charges defined as current maturities of longterm debt interest expense rent expense and distributions of greater than 125 to 10 and a funded indebtedness defined as total indebtedness less accounts payable accrued expenses and deferred revenues to ebitda of no greater than 20 to 10 both of which are measure d on a quarterly basis the operating and financial covenants in the loan agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into may restrict our ability to finance our operations engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies we may also be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on our debt which would reduce the amount of money we have for operations working capital expansion or other general corporate purposes 

our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations and comply with the operating and financial covenants may be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to control many of these factors and comply with these covenants a breach of any of the covenants under our loan agreements could result in an event of default which could cause all of our outstanding indebtedness to become immediately due and payable

we may acquire other businesses applications or technologies which could divert our management’s attention result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results

in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses applications or technologies that we believe complement or expand our applications enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities the pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur expenses in identifying investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions whether or not they are ultimately consummated

we do not have any experience in acquiring other businesses if we acquire additional businesses we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel operations and technologies successfully or to effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition we also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors including























in addition a significant portion of the purchase price of any companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets which must be assessed for impairment at least annually in the future if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process which could harm our results of operations acquisitions could also result in issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt which would result in dilution to our stockholders

our growth depends in part on the success of our relationships with third parties

we rely on thirdparty financial and accounting processing systems as well as various financial institutions to perform financial services in connection with our applications such as providing automated clearing house “ach” and wire transfers as part of our payroll and expense reimbursement services and to provide technology and content support manufacture time clocks and process background checks we anticipate that we will continue to depend on various thirdparty relationships in order to grow our business provide technology and content support manufacture time clocks and process background checks identifying negotiating and documenting relationships with these third parties and integrating thirdparty content and technology requires significant time and resources our agreements with third parties typically are nonexclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors 

 

 

in addition these third parties may not perform as expected under our agreements and we may have disagreements or disputes with such third parties which could negatively affect our brand and reputation a global economic slowdown could also adversely affect the businesses of our thirdparty providers particularly those financial institutions that process transact ions through the ach network and it is possible that they may not be able to devote the resources we expect to our relationship 

if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected even if we are successful these relationships may not result in improved operating results

adverse economic conditions could affect our business operating results or financial condition

our business depends on the overall demand for hcm applications and on the economic health of our current and prospective clients if economic conditions in the united states or in global markets deteriorate clients may cease their operations delay or reduce their spending on hcm and other outsourcing services or attempt to renegotiate their contracts with us this could result in reductions in sales of our applications longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition in addition hcm spending levels may not increase following any recovery

further as part of our payroll and tax filing application we collect and then remit client funds to taxing authorities and accounts designated by our clients during the interval between receipt and disbursement we may invest such funds in money market funds demand deposit accounts certificates of deposit and commercial paper these investments are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks and such risks may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility any loss of or inability to access such funds could have an adverse impact on our cash position and results of operations and could require us to obtain additional sources of liquidity which may not be available on reasonable terms if at all

if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings

we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as of december 31 2017 we had recorded a total of 519 million of goodwill and 10 million of other intangible assets an adverse change in domestic or global market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of our critical assumptions or estimates made in connection with the impairment testing of goodwill or intangible assets could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge to our goodwill or other intangible assets any such material charges may have a negative impact on our operating results

we typically pay employees and may pay taxing authorities amounts due for a payroll period before a client’s electronic funds transfers are finally settled to our account if client payments are rejected by banking institutions or otherwise fail to clear into our accounts we may require additional sources of shortterm liquidity and our operating results could be adversely affected

our payroll processing application moves significant funds from the account of a client to employees and relevant taxing authorities for larger funding amounts we require clients to transfer the funds to us via fed wire for smaller funding amounts we debit a client’s account prior to any disbursement on its behalf and due to ach banking regulations funds previously credited could be reversed under certain circumstances and time frames after our payment of amounts due to employees and taxing and other regulatory authorities there is therefore a risk that the employer’s funds will be insufficient to cover the amounts we have already paid on its behalf while such shortage and accompanying financial exposure has only occurred in very limited circumstances in the past should clients default on their payment obligations in the future we might be required to advance substantial funds to cover such obligations in such an event we may be required to seek additional sources of shortterm liquidity which may not be available on reasonable terms if at all and our operating results and our liquidity could be adversely affected and our banking relationships could be harmed

because our longterm success may depend in part on our ability to expand the sales of our solution to clients located outside of the united states our business could be subject to risks associated with international operations

an element of our growth strategy is to expand our operations and client base to date we have not engaged in any operations outside of the united states if we decide to expand our operations into international markets it will require significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory economic and political risks that are different from those in the united states because of our lack of experience with international operations we cannot ensure that our international expansion efforts will be successful and the impact of such expansion efforts may adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected

as a public company we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements management must evaluate and furnish a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and our auditors must attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting

 

 

if we have a material weakness in our internal cont rol over financial reporting we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated compliance with the public company requirements has made some activities more timeconsuming costly and complicated if we i dentify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting investors may los e confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports andor we could become subject to investigations by the new york stock exchange the “nyse” the sec or other regulatory authorities and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected 

adverse tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our clients which could increase the costs of our solution and applications and could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

as a vendor of services we are ordinarily held responsible by taxing authorities for collecting and paying any applicable sales or other similar taxes additionally the application of federal state and local tax laws to services provided electronically like ours is evolving new income sales use or other tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time possibly with retroactive effect and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services and applications provided over the internet these enactments could adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and ultimately could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that change over time we review these rules and regulations periodically and when we believe we are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state we may voluntarily engage state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with that state’s rules and regulations we cannot ensure that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we currently believe no such taxes are required 

in addition existing tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be interpreted changed modified or applied adversely to us possibly with retroactive effect which could require us or our clients to pay additional tax amounts as well as require us or our clients to pay fines or penalties and substantial interest for past amounts if we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our clients we could be held liable for such costs thereby adversely affecting our business operating results or financial condition additionally the imposition of such taxes on us would effectively increase the cost of our software and services we provide to clients and would likely have a negative impact on our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the jurisdictions in which such taxes are imposed

our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance

from time to time we have released and may continue to release guidance in our earnings conference calls earnings releases or otherwise regarding our future performance which represents our estimates as of the date of release this guidance which includes forwardlooking statements has been and will be based on projections prepared by our management these projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections accordingly no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections

projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that while presented with numerical specificity are inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control projections are also based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions some of which will change the principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any third parties

guidance is necessarily speculative in nature and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will vary significantly from actual results accordingly our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material in light of the foregoing investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock

any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this “risk factors” section in this form 10k could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance and the differences may be adverse and material

the issuance of additional stock in connection with acquisitions our stock incentive plans warrants or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to one hundred million shares of common stock and up to ten million shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations we may issue all of these shares that are not already outstanding without any action or approval by our stockholders we intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions in the future we may pay for such acquisitions partly or in full through the issuance of additional equity securities

 

 

any issuance of shares in connection with an acquisition the exercise of stock options or warrants the award of shares of restric ted stock or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by our existing stockholders 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management

any provision of our certificate of incorporation bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

generally accepted accounting principles in the united states are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change

our certificate of incorporation contains an exclusive forum provision that may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers

our certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if no court of chancery located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or other employees to us or our stockholders any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of delaware law or our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws as either may be amended from time to time or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers alternatively if a court outside of delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in multiple jurisdictions which could materially and adversely affect our financial results

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this “form 10k” the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties see part i “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” for a discussion of the uncertainties risks and assumptions associated with those statements actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward looking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in the section entitled “risk factors” unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires the terms “we” “us” “our” and the “company” refer to paycom software inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 

overview

we are a leading provider of comprehensive cloudbased human capital management “hcm” software delivered as softwareasaservice we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions including talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and human resources “hr” management applications our userfriendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees enabling selfmanagement of their hcm activities in the cloud which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity

we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry we have over 20000 clients none of which constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 we stored data for nearly 33 million persons employed by our clients during the year ended december 31 2017

our revenues are primarily generated through our sales force that solicits new clients and our client relations representatives who sell additional applications to existing clients as of the filing of this form 10k we have 46 sales teams located in 26 states and plan to open additional sales offices to further expand our presence in the us market during the year ended december 31 2017 we opened three new sales offices with one new sales office located in each of milwaukee richmond and long island on february 6 2018 we announced the opening of our salt lake city office our continued growth depends on attracting new clients through further penetration of our existing markets geographic expansion and the introduction of new applications to our existing client base we also expect that changes in certain factors affecting our performance will correlate with improvement or deterioration in the labor market our principal marketing programs include national and local television commercials email campaigns social and digital media campaigns tradeshows and search engine marketing methods that include website optimization and payperclick searches in addition we generate awareness and build recognition of our brand and thought leadership with relevant and informative content through podcasts white papers infographics and webinars

during the last three years we have developed several new applications we believe our ability to continue to develop new applications and to improve existing applications will enable us to increase revenues in the future and the number of our new applications adopted by our clients has been a significant factor in our revenue growth over the last three years

trends opportunities and challenges

our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications as a result of our significant revenue growth and geographic expansion since our initial public offering in april 2014 we are presented with a variety of opportunities and challenges our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications consequently we have historically generated the majority of our revenues from payroll processing although our revenue mix has evolved and will continue to evolve as we develop and add new nonpayroll applications to our solution client adoption of new applications has been a significant factor in our revenue growth over the last three years and we expect that the continuation of this trajectory will depend in part on the introduction of new applications to our existing client base moreover in order to increase revenues and continue to improve our operating results we must also attract new clients we intend to obtain new clients by i opening sales offices in new metropolitan areas and ii continuing to expand our presence in metropolitan areas where we currently have an existing sales office through adding sales teams or offices thereby increasing the number of sales professionals within such markets

for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 our gross margins were approximately 83 84 and 84 respectively although our gross margins may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonality and hiring trends we expect that our gross margins will remain relatively consistent in future periods

 

 

growing our business has also r esulted in and will continue to result in substantial investment in sales professionals operating expenses systems development and programming costs and general and administrative expenses which has and will continue to increase our expenses specific ally our revenue growth and geographic expansion drive increases in our employee headcount which in turn precipitates increases in i salaries and benefits ii stockbased compensation expense and iii costs related to the expansion of our corporate headquarters while we expect our growth to continue to drive increases in headcount personnel costs and general operating expenses for the foreseeable future we also expect to continue our practice of driving efficiencies across our organization we an ticipate leveraging our size and benefiting from economies of scale and believe these efficiencies will allow for ongoing realization of competitive operating margins and cash flows we intend to obtain new clients by i continuing to expand our presenc e in metropolitan areas where we currently have an existing sales office through adding sales teams or offices and increasing the number of our sales professionals and ii opening sales offices in new metropolitan areas our ability to increase revenues a nd improve operating results depends on our ability to add new clients 

the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations and increased the number of applications we offer based on our total revenues we have grown at an approximately 42 cagr from january 1 2013 through december 31 2017 because we charge our clients on a per employee basis for certain services we provide any increase or decrease in the number of employees that our clients have will have a positive or negative impact respectively on our results of operations our solution requires no adjustment to serve larger clients we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of potential clients and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost to us moreover we believe we are wellpositioned to take full advantage of improved economic and hiring trends that result from changes in the regulatory environment including but not limited to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” in december 2017 while the impact of the tax act on our current and prospective clients and their hiring decisions is still yet to be fully understood we anticipate wage increases and higher employee counts resulting from improved economic and hiring trends could have a net positive impact on our results in 2018 and beyond we also expect the lower federal corporate tax rate under the tax act to result in a reduction to our future overall effective tax rate and to have a net positive effect on our net earnings and operating cash flows

we believe the challenges of managing the everchanging complexity of payroll and human resources will continue to drive companies to turn to outsourced providers for help with their hcm needs the hcm industry historically has been driven in part by legislation and regulatory action including cobra changes to the minimum wage laws or overtime rules and legislation from federal state or municipal taxation authorities the implementation of the affordable care act the “aca” is the most recent example of legislation that has created demand in the hcm industry we generate acarelated revenues i on an annual basis in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients and ii from clients who have purchased our enhanced aca application as part of the fixed bundled price charged per billing period while we generally do not track our revenues on an applicationbyapplication basis because applications are often sold in various groupings and configurations for a single price we estimate that if the aca is not modified or repealed revenues from our enhanced aca application and aca forms filings business will represent approximately 5 of total projected revenues for the year ending december 31 2018

throughout our history we have built strong relationships with our clients as the hcm needs of our clients evolve we believe that we are wellpositioned to gain additional share of the hcm spending of our clients and we believe this opportunity is significant to be successful we must continue to demonstrate the operational and economic benefits of our solution as well as effectively hire train motivate and retain qualified personnel

key metrics

in addition to the us gaap and nongaap metrics discussed elsewhere in this form 10k we also monitor the following metrics to evaluate our business measure our performance and identify trends affecting our business 

 



 



 

 







components of results of operations

sources of revenues 

revenues are comprised of recurring revenues and implementation and other revenues we expect our revenues to increase as we introduce new applications expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients as a percentage of total revenues we expect our mix of recurring revenues and implementation and other revenues to remain relatively constant

recurring recurring revenues include fees for our talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for form filings and delivery of client payroll checks and reports these revenues are derived from i fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed or ii fixed amounts charged per billing period we do not require clients to enter into longterm contractual commitments with us our billing period varies by client based on when they pay their employees which is done either weekly biweekly semimonthly or monthly because recurring revenues are based in part on fees for use of our applications and the delivery of checks and reports that are levied on a peremployee basis our recurring revenues increase as our clients hire more employees recurring revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered beginning april 1 2016 recurring revenues also include interest earned on funds held for clients we collect funds from clients in advance of either the applicable due date for payroll tax submissions or the applicable disbursement date for employee payment services these collections from clients are typically disbursed from one to 30 days after receipt with some funds being held for up to 120 days we typically invest funds held for clients in money market funds demand deposit accounts commercial paper and certificates of deposit until they are paid to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees we expect that interest earned on funds held for clients will increase as we introduce new applications expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients the amount of interest we earn from the investment of client funds is also impacted by changes in interest rates recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs such as bonuses for our clients because payroll forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year first quarter revenues and margins are generally higher than in subsequent quarters further beginning in the first quarter of 2016 we began generating additional revenues as a result of the enactment of the aca as many clients began complying with filing requirements for forms 1094 and 1095 we anticipate that our revenues will continue to exhibit this seasonal pattern related to aca form filings for so long as the aca or replacement legislation includes employer reporting requirements in addition we often experience increased revenues during the fourth quarter due to unscheduled payroll runs for our clients that occur before the end of the year therefore we expect the seasonality of our revenue cycle to decrease to the extent clients utilize more of our nonpayroll applications 

implementation and other implementation and other revenues are comprised of implementation fees for the deployment of our solution and other revenues from sales of time clocks as part of our time and attendance services nonrefundable implementation fees are charged to new clients at inception and upon the addition of certain incremental applications for existing clients these fees range from 10 to 30 of the annualized value of the transaction implementation revenues are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the life of the client which is estimated to be ten years and other revenues are recognized upon shipment of time clocks implementation and other revenues comprised approximately 18 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2017

our consolidated financial statements include a provision for income taxes incurred for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as for any operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 

 

 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of income data and such data as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods indicated as well as yearoveryear changes with respect to each line item 

 



 

revenues

the increase in total revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 from the year ended december 31 2016 was due to several factors including i the addition of new clients in mature sales offices which are offices that have been open for at least 24 months and in sales offices that reached maturity during 2017 ii contributions from the six new sales offices opened in 2016 that are progressing to maturity iii the sale of additional applications to our existing clients iv the strong performance of our tax forms filing business and v growth in our clients’ employee headcounts as a result of favorable economic conditions nonetheless the magnitude of the increases in revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 was tempered as a result of the hurricanes that hit texas and florida in august and september in particular we experienced some disruption to our prospecting and conversion efforts in the affected areas and we noted certain newly signed clients delayed implementation of our solution 

the increase in total revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 from the year ended december 31 2015 was due to several factors including i the addition of clients in mature sales offices as well as contributions from sales offices that were reaching maturity in 2016 ii the addition of new clients in the sales offices opened in 2016 iii the sale of additional applications to our existing clients iv additional revenues in the first quarter attributable to the strong performance of our tax form filing business including additional revenues from the first year of acarelated filings v an increase in average revenues per client as we continued to sell our applications to larger clients and vi growth in the number of employees of our clients in addition during the second quarter of 2016 we elected to change our accounting policy for recording interest income earned on funds held for clients such that beginning april 1 2016 interest earned in the period between receipt and disbursement of client funds is recorded as recurring revenue prior to april 1 2016 this interest income was recorded as other income net

 

 

expenses 

cost of revenues

the increase in cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 from the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily due to a 122 million increase in employeerelated expenses which consisted of a 105 million increase in expenses attributable to growth in the number of operating personnel and a 17 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense additionally shipping fees and ach fees increased 11 million and 09 million respectively in connection with increased sales depreciation and amortization expense increased 38 million or 65 primarily due to the development of additional technology and purchases of other assets particularly with respect to the new headquarters building that was not in service for the entire prior year period

the increase in cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 from the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily due to a 123 million increase in employeerelated expenses which consisted of a 103 million increase in expenses related to an increase in the number of operating personnel and a 20 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense additionally shipping fees and ach fees each increased 13 million in connection with increased sales depreciation and amortization expense increased 21 million or 57 primarily due to the development of technology purchases of other assets and the construction of assets in connection with the expansion of our headquarters

administrative expenses

sales and marketing

during the year ended december 31 2017 sales and marketing expenses increased from the comparable prior year period due to a 247 million increase in employeerelated expenses including commissions and bonuses a 42 increase in marketing and advertising expense and a 24 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense 

during the year ended december 31 2016 sales and marketing expenses increased from the comparable prior year period primarily due to a 221 million increase in employeerelated expenses including commissions and bonuses and a 31 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense 

research and development

during the year ended december 31 2017 research and development expenses increased from the comparable prior year period due to an 84 million increase in expenses related to growth in the number of research and development personnel and a 11 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense

during the year ended december 31 2016 research and development expenses increased from the comparable prior year period due to an 116 million increase in expenses related to an increase in the number of research and development personnel and a 07 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense 

as we continue the ongoing development of our platform and product offerings we generally expect research and development expenses exclusive of stockbased compensation to continue to increase particularly as we hire more personnel to support our growth while we expect this trend to continue on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of total revenues we also anticipate the rate of increase to decline over time as we leverage our growth and realize additional economies of scale as is customary for our business we also expect fluctuations in research and development expense as a percentage of revenue on a quartertoquarter basis due to seasonal revenue trends the amount and timing of research and development costs that may be capitalized and the timing of onboarding new hires and restricted stock vesting events 

expenditures for software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a threeyear period on a straightline basis the nature of the development projects underway during a particular period directly impacts the timing and extent of these capitalized expenditures and can affect the amount of research and development expenses in such period the table below sets forth the amounts of capitalized and expensed research and development costs for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015

 



 

 

 

general and administrative 

during the year ended december 31 2017 general and administrative expenses increased from the comparable prior year period due to a 134 million increase in employeerelated expenses and a 107 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense which were partially offset by a 16 million decrease in accounting and legal costs

during the year ended december 31 2016 general and administrative expenses increased from the comparable prior year period primarily due to a 137 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense and a 75 million increase in employeerelated expenses 

noncash stockbased compensation expense

 



 

during the year ended december 31 2017 our noncash stockbased compensation expense increased 160 million primarily due to the vesting of restricted stock with marketbased vesting conditions and the issuance of restricted stock with a greater grantdate fair value than shares issued in the prior year during the year ended december 31 2016 our noncash stockbased compensation expense increased 195 million primarily due to the issuance and subsequent vesting of restricted stock with marketbased vesting conditions 

depreciation and amortization

during the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 depreciation and amortization expense increased from the comparable prior year periods primarily due to the development of additional technology and purchases of other assets particularly with respect to the timing of new buildings that were placed in service in 2016 and 2017

provision for income taxes

for the year ended december 31 2017 income tax expense decreased compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the decrease primarily resulted from the recognition of excess tax benefits from sharebased payment awards due to the vesting of various marketbased awards during 2017 as a result of the tax act we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on expected future rates this remeasurement resulted in a 04 million charge to our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2017

other income net

for the year ended december 31 2017 other income net decreased 14 million compared to the year ended december 31 2016 due to 09 million loss on early repayment of debt and a 06 million unrealized loss recognized on the fair value of an interest rate swap the early repayment of debt and the interest rate swap related to our entry into a new credit agreement in december 2017 as discussed under “liquidity and capital resources” below see note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the interest rate swap

liquidity and capital resources

our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents which totaled 461 million and 602 million as of december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively our cash and cash equivalents are comprised primarily of demand deposit accounts money market funds and certificates of deposit we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months

we have historically financed our operations from cash flows generated from operations cash from the sale of debt and equity securities and borrowings under our loans since inception we have raised 1251 million of equity capital 643 million of which was the net proceeds raised in our initial public offering that closed in april 2014 although we have funded most of the costs for ongoing construction projects at our corporate headquarters from available cash we have incurred indebtedness for a portion of these 

 

 

costs and may continue to d o so in the future further to date all purchases under our stock repurchase plan have been paid for from available cash and to the extent we repurchase additional shares in the future we expect to continue to use cash 

recent liquidity developments

new credit agreement on december 7 2017 the “effective date” we entered into a senior secured term credit agreement the “new credit agreement” pursuant to which jpmorgan chase bank na bank of america na and kirkpatrick bank collectively the “lenders” have agreed to make certain term loans to us the “term loans” in an aggregate principal amount of 600 million on or prior to september 7 2018 as of december 31 2017 our indebtedness consists solely of term loans made under the new credit agreement 

on the effective date in connection with our entry into the new credit agreement we terminated and prepaid all obligations outstanding under i the consolidated amended and restated loan agreement with kirkpatrick bank dated december 15 2011 as amended from time to time ii the loan agreement with kirkpatrick bank dated may 13 2015 as amended from time to time and iii the loan agreement with kirkpatrick bank dated august 2 2016 collectively the “existing credit agreements” including applicable interest and prepayment penalties in conjunction with the termination and prepayment of the existing credit agreements we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of 08 million for the year ended december 31 2017 which is included in other income net in the consolidated statements of income the principal and accrued interest outstanding together with remaining borrowing capacity under these terminated agreements was approximately 576 million in the aggregate as of the effective date proceeds of the term loans made on the effective date were used to refinance existing indebtedness associated with these terminated agreements

in connection with entering into the new credit agreement we also entered into a floatingtofixed interest rate swap agreement to limit the exposure to interest rate risk related to the term loans the “interest rate swap agreement” the interest rate swap agreement which has a maturity date of september 7 2025 provides that we will receive quarterly variable interest payments based on the libor rate and will pay interest at a fixed rate we have elected not to designate this interest rate swap as a hedge and as such changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are being recognized in earnings in our consolidated statements of income for the fiscal year ended december 31 2017 we recorded a loss of 06 million for the change in fair value of the interest rate swap which is included in other income net in the consolidated statements of income

common stock through october 30 2019  additionally as announced on february 13 2018 our board of directors further amended and extended the stock repurchase plan such that we are authorized to purchase up to an additional 1000 million of common stock as of the filing of this form 10 k there was 1324 million available for repurchases the stock repurchase plan will expire on february 12 2020 shares may be repurchased from timetotime in open market transactions at prevailing market prices in privately negotiated transactions o r by other means in accordance with federal securities laws including rule 10b51 programs and the repurchase plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time the actual timing number and value of shares repurchased depends on a number of factors in cluding the market price of our common stock general market and economic conditions and other corporate considerations 

during the year ended december 31 2017 we repurchased an aggregate of 1238577 shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of 897 million including 464302 shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to the delivery of vested shares of restricted stock to certain employees as discussed below 

withholding shares to cover taxes  during the year ended december 31 2017 we withheld 464302 shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to the delivery of vested shares of restricted stock to certain employees our payment of the taxes on behalf of those employees resulted in an expenditure of 328 million in cash and as such we generally subtract the amounts attributable to such withheld shares from the aggregate amount available for future purchases under our stock repurchase plan 

cash flow analysis

our cash flows from operating activities have historically been significantly impacted by profitability implementation revenues received but deferred research and development and our investment in sales and marketing to drive growth our ability to meet future liquidity needs will be driven by our operating performance and the extent of continued investment in our operations failure to generate sufficient revenues and related cash flows could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our liquidity needs and achieve our business objectives

as our business grows we expect our capital expenditures and our investment activity to continue to increase depending on certain growth opportunities we may choose to accelerate investments in sales and marketing acquisitions technology and services actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our future revenues cash from operating activities and the level of expenditures in all areas of our business and may use available cash to repurchase shares of our common stock

as part of our payroll and payroll tax filing services we collect funds from our clients for federal state and local employment taxes which we remit to the appropriate tax agencies we invest these funds in money market funds demand deposit accounts commercial paper and certificates of deposit from which we earn interest income during the period between their receipt and disbursement

our cash flows from investing and financing activities are influenced by the amount of funds held for clients which varies significantly from quarter to quarter the balance of the funds we hold depends on our clients’ payroll calendars and therefore such balance changes from period to period in accordance with the timing of each payroll cycle 

our cash flows from financing activities are also affected by the extent to which we use available cash to purchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase plan as well as restricted stock vesting events that may result in the company paying withholding taxes on behalf of certain employees

the following table summarizes the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015

cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december 31 2017 changed by 853 million due to the impact of changes in funds held for clients and a 156 million increase in cash used for purchases of property and equipment primarily as a result of the ongoing construction of our fourth headquarters building

financing activities

cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december 31 2017 changed by 301 million due to the impact of changes in client funds obligation which is due to the timing of receipts from our clients and payments to our client’s employees financing cash flows were also impacted by the 359 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt these cash flows provided by financing activities were partially offset by the 343 million increase in payments on longterm debt related to our previous loan agreements a 213 million increase in open market purchases of common stock an 185 million increase in withholding taxes paid related to net share settlements 08 million in debt extinguishment costs and a 03 million increase in the payment of debt issuance costs

contractual obligations

our principal commitments primarily consist of longterm debt and leases for office space we disclose our longterm debt in note 5 and our commitments and contingencies in note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

as of december 31 2017 the future noncancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows

 



we may continue to lease additional office space to support our growth in addition many of our existing lease agreements provide us with the option to renew our future operating lease obligations include payments due during any renewal period provided for in the lease where the lease imposes a penalty for failure to renew

 

 

the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are ass ociated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum services to be used fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 

offbalance sheet arrangements

as of december 31 2017 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that may be material to investors

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results may materially differ from these estimates made by management under different assumptions and conditions

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are described below accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations

revenue recognition

our total revenues are comprised of recurring revenues and implementation and other revenues we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting standards for software and service companies when all of the following criteria have been met









recurring revenues are derived primarily from our talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management applications these services are rendered during each client’s payroll period with the agreedupon fee being charged and collected as part of the client’s payroll revenues are recognized at time of billing of each client’s payroll period collectability is reasonably assured as the fees are collected through ach as part of the client’s payroll cycle or through direct wire transfer which minimizes the default risk our implementation and other revenues represent nonrefundable conversion fees which are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client setup and revenues from sale of time clocks as part of our employee time and attendance services because these conversion fees and sale of time clocks relate to our recurring revenues we have evaluated such arrangements under the accounting guidance that governs multiple element arrangements

for arrangements with multiple elements we evaluate whether each element represents a separate unit of accounting in order to treat deliverables in a multiple element arrangement as separate units of accounting the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery if the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery we account for each deliverable separately and revenue is recognized for the respective deliverables as they are delivered if one or more of the deliverables does not have standalone value upon delivery the deliverables that do not have standalone value are generally combined with the final deliverable within the arrangement and treated as a single unit of accounting

for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 we determined that there was no standalone value associated with the upfront conversion fees as they did not have value to our clients on a standalone basis nor were they offered as an individual service therefore the conversion fees were deferred and are recognized ratably over the estimated life of our clients based on our historical client attrition rate which we estimate to be ten years revenues from the sale of time clocks are recognized when they are delivered

goodwill and other intangible assets

goodwill is not amortized but we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually or earlier if at the reporting unit level an indicator of impairment arises the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows if impairment exists a writedown to fair value is recorded our business is largely homogeneous and as a result goodwill is associated with one reporting unit we have selected june 30 as our annual goodwill impairment testing date and determined there was no impairment as of june 30 2017 for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 there were no indicators of impairment intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives

 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets including intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset we have determined that there is no impairment of longlived assets for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015

restricted stock 

we measure noncash stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock awards issued by using a monte carlo simulation model this model considers various subjective assumptions as inputs and represent our best estimates which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment as it relates to market volatilities the historical volatility of our stock price riskfree rates and expected life the valuation model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data determining these assumptions is subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock awards and the associated compensation expense refer to note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stockbased compensation awards

refer to note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements

nongaap financial measures

management uses adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income as supplemental measures to review and assess the performance of our core business operations and for planning purposes we define i adjusted ebitda as net income plus interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization noncash stockbased compensation expense loss on early repayment of debt certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap and ii nongaap net income as net income plus noncash stockbased compensation expense certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations loss on early repayment of debt and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap all of which are adjusted for the effect of income taxes adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income are metrics that provide investors with greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking we believe these metrics are useful to investors because they facilitate comparisons of our core business operations across periods on a consistent basis as well as comparisons with the results of peer companies many of which use similar nongaap financial measures to supplement results under us gaap in addition adjusted ebitda is a measure that provides useful information to management about the amount of cash available for reinvestment in our business repurchasing common stock and other purposes management believes that the nongaap measures presented in this form 10k when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with us gaap provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business and performance

adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income are not measures of financial performance under us gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income which we consider to be the most directly comparable us gaap measure adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing our operating performance you should not consider adjusted ebitda or nongaap net income in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other consolidated statements of income data prepared in accordance with us gaap adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income may not be comparable to similar titled measures of other companies and other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do

 

 

the following tables reconcile net income to adjusted ebitda net income to nongaap net income and earnings per share to nongaap net income per share on a basic and d iluted basis 

 



 



 



 

 

 



 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate sensitivity

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 461 million as of december 31 2017 we consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less and money market funds to be cash equivalents these amounts are invested primarily in demand deposit accounts money market funds and certificates of deposit we also invest funds held for clients in money market funds demand deposit accounts commercial paper and certificates of deposit the primary objectives of our investing activities are capital preservation meeting our liquidity needs and with respect to investing client funds generating interest income while maintaining the safety of principal we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes

our investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates the market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates

we do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition with respect to our cash equivalents

in december 2017 we entered into the new credit agreement pursuant to which the lenders have agreed to make term loans to us in an aggregate principal amount of 600 million which will mature september 7 2025 as describe elsewhere in this form 10k the term loans bear interest at a variable stated interest rate that is determined based on an adjusted libor rate as a result we are exposed to increased interest rate risk to mitigate the increased interest rate risk we entered into the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate swap has effectively fixed our rate at 40 eliminating a portion of the variable rate and coinciding interest rate risk associated with the new term loans

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure we believe however that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error within a company if any have been detected 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2017 the end of the period covered by this form 10k based upon such evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date

overview

we are a leading provider of a comprehensive cloudbased hcm software solution delivered as saas we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions including talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and human resources “hr” management applications our userfriendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees enabling selfmanagement of their hcm activities in the cloud which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity

organizations need sophisticated flexible and intuitive applications that can quickly adapt to their evolving hcm requirements streamline their hr processes and systems and enable them to control costs we believe that the hcm needs of most organizations are currently served either by multiple providers that partner in an attempt to replicate a comprehensive saas product or by legacy providers offering outdated onpremise products these approaches often result in challenges with system integration low scalability high costs extended delivery times and large upfront capital requirements

because our solution was developed inhouse and is based on a single platform there is no need to integrate update or access multiple databases which are common issues with competitor offerings that use multiple thirdparty systems in order to link together their hcm offerings additionally our solution maintains data integrity for accurate actionable and realtime analytics and business intelligence and helps clients minimize the risk of compliance errors due to inaccurate or missing information we deliver featurerich applications while maintaining excellence in information security and quality management standards as evidenced by our international organization for standardization “iso” certifications 

we sell our solution directly through our internally trained clientfocused and highly skilled sales force based in offices across the united states as a part of our client retention effort a specialist within a dedicated team is assigned to each client to provide industryleading personalized service we have over 17800 clients none of which constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 we believe that as a result of our focus on client retention we enjoy high client satisfaction as evidenced by an annual revenue retention rate of 91 from existing clients for each of the three years ended 

 

 

december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 we believe our revenue retention rate understates our client loyalty because th is rate also includes former clients that were acquired or otherwise ceased operations 

we were founded in 1998 since our founding we have focused on providing an innovative saas hcm solution as of december 31 2016 we had 2075 employees across the united states for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 our revenues were 3291 million 2247 million and 1509 million respectively representing yearoveryear growth in revenues of approximately 47 and 49 respectively we currently derive the majority of our revenues from payroll processing we are able to determine revenues from payroll processing because all of our clients are required to utilize our payroll application in order to access our other applications we generally do not separately track our revenues across our other applications because we often sell applications in various groupings and configurations for a single price we realized net income of 438 million 209 million and 57 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively

according to the international data corporation “idc” the us market for hcm applications is comprised of software that automates business processes covering the entire span of an employee’s relationship with his or her employer idc estimates that the us market for hcm applications excluding payroll services and expense management will total 88 billion in 2017 these applications include maintenance of hr records recruiting applications performance management time and labor management tracking compliance compensation management and other hr functions according to idc the us market for payroll services will be an estimated 177 billion in 2017 the payroll services market includes transactional activities associated with paying employees maintaining accounting records and administrating payroll taxes while payroll accounting applications offer the functionality to effectively track these various payments and transfers

secure cloudbased architecture

our cloudbased architecture allows our solution to be implemented remotely with minimal client interaction updates such as software enhancements and newly developed applications can be deployed without client interaction disruption or involvement allowing our clients to make a smaller investment in hardware personnel implementation time and consulting additionally we own and maintain all of the infrastructure technology to host our solution and to maximize system availability for clients our focus and investment in technology and data security has been recognized with isoiec 270012013 certified security standards that provide our clients with a “bestinclass” level of data security

scalability to grow with our clients

our solution is highly scalable we serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one to over 8000 employees we calculate the number of clients’ employees based on parent company grouping our clients are able to use the same solution while their businesses grow by deploying applications asneeded in realtime pricing is determined by employee headcount and the number of applications utilized enabling our clients to align hcm spending with their evolving hcm needs as compared to traditional hcm products that require clients to migrate to new software as they grow but retain fixed costs even if the client shrinks in size

efficient and productive research and development

we believe that we benefit from a competitive advantage with our research and development investments people and processes early investments in our proprietary cloudbased architecture enable us to develop and deploy applications in a timely and costeffective manner we have also chosen to base our research and development team in oklahoma and texas which we believe provides us with highquality talent at a lower cost compared to other locations in the united states where there is more competition for technology talent these strategic decisions have enabled us to have a highly productive research and development function while our research and development expenses grew 143 99 and 102 from the comparable year period for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively

our strategy for growth

our strategy is to continue to establish our solution as the hcm industry standard to accomplish this we intend to

increase our presence in existing markets

we believe a significant market opportunity exists to increase our presence within markets where we currently have a sales office each sales office is typically staffed with one sales team with each team comprised of a sales manager and approximately six to eight other sales professionals although we have a sales office in 32 of the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas “msas” in the united states based on july 2015 us census bureau estimates only five of these msas are currently served by multiple paycom sales teams in addition to expanding into new markets we plan to further penetrate and more effectively capture existing markets by adding sales offices and increasing the number of sales teams in such markets since our initial public offering “ipo” in april 2014 we have expanded our presence within three msas that were already served by at least one paycom sales team by opening new sales offices in brooklyn chicago and pasadena 

 

 

expand into additio nal markets 

we plan to continue expanding our sales capability by opening sales offices in certain metropolitan areas where we currently have no sales teams since our ipo in april 2014 we have expanded into eight new markets by opening new sales offices in cincinnati cleveland kansas city nashville pittsburgh sacramento san antonio and stamford we intend to open 10 to 14 additional sales offices over the next two years as well as potentially expand over the longer term into international markets

we have historically selected new locations based on potential client and employee demographics as well as business density our property management team handles the nonpersonnel aspects of new office openings from securing an office lease through establishing information security infrastructure and procedures for the prospective office location when opening a new sales office we typically relocate a proven sales manager from an existing territory who then recruits a team of high performing sales representatives it typically takes a new sales office 24 months to reach maturity 

enlarge our existing client relationships

we dedicate our resources to helping our clients facilitate their goals whether through helping them execute better hiring decisions manage compensation more effectively or simply operate more efficiently we believe a significant growth opportunity exists in selling additional applications to our current clients many clients have subsequently deployed additional applications as they recognize the benefits of our comprehensive solution as we extend and enhance the functionality of our solution we will continue to invest in initiatives to increase the adoption of our solution and maintain our high levels of client satisfaction

target larger clients

the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations and increased the number of applications we offer based on our total revenues we have grown at an approximately 44 cagr from january 1 2012 through december 31 2016 our solution requires no adjustment to serve larger clients we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost to us to further capitalize on this opportunity we intend to target larger businesses opportunistically where our current sales model is effective

maintain our leadership in innovation by strengthening and extending our solution

our ability to develop and deploy new applications and updates rapidly and costeffectively has been integral to the results that we have achieved to date we intend to continue extending the functionality and range of our solution in the future our development efforts are performed exclusively inhouse and are heavily based upon proactive research and client input we are focusing our investments on the development of new applications and enhancements that are responsive to the needs of our clients which are garnered through ongoing client interaction and collaboration

our applications

our hcm solution offers a full suite of applications that generally fall within the following categories talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management

talent acquisition

 



 

 



time and labor management

 



 

 

payroll 

 



talent management

our clients

we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry we have over 17800 clients or approximately 10000 clients based on parent company grouping none of which constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 we stored data for more than 27 million persons employed by our clients during the year ended december 31 2016

many small to midsized companies can typically make the decision to adopt our solution more quickly than larger companies which we believe results in a shorter sales cycle and more closely corresponds to our target sales cycle of 30 to 90 days as a result of the nature and size of our clientele we maintain a diversified client base and very low revenue concentration among our clients we believe however that larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost as we attract clients at the higher end of our target client size range we may face longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales

competition

the market for hcm solutions is rapidly evolving highly competitive and subject to changing technology shifting client needs and frequent introduction of new products and services our competitors range from small regional firms to large wellestablished international firms with multiple product offerings

we compete with firms that provide hcm solutions by various means many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software but as demand for greater flexibility and access to information grows we believe there will be increased competition in the 

 

 

d elivery of hcm cloudbased solutions by other saas providers our competitors offer hcm solutions that may overlap with one several or all categories of applications offered by our solution our talent acquisition and talent management applications compet e primarily with cornerstone ondemand inc oracle corporation sap se and workday inc our payroll applications including payroll processing compete primarily with automatic data processing inc “adp” ceridian hcm inc “ceridian” concur techno logies inc intuit inc paychex inc paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc our hr management applications compete primarily with adp ceridian oracle corporation paychex inc paylocity holding corporation sap se and workday inc our time and labor management applications compete primarily with adp ceridian kronos incorporated paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc our larger competitors compete with us across multiple segments in add ition our hcm solution continues to face competition from inhouse payroll and hr systems and departments as well as hr systems and software sold by thirdparty vendors 

competition in the hcm solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation breadth of service and application offering and price the importance of these factors depends on the size of the business price tends to be the most important factor of competition for smaller businesses with fewer employees while the scope of features and customization is more important to larger businesses regardless of a company’s size another important factor is the implementation experience as all organizations are seeking a streamlined and simplified onboarding process we believe that our saas delivery model allows us to be most competitive in the hcm solutions market across this spectrum

technology operations and security

technology

our multitenant architecture enables us to deliver our solution across our client base with a single instance of our solution while securely partitioning access to our clients’ respective application data because a single version of our solution is developed supported and deployed across all of our clients updates are delivered to all of our clients at the same time making it easier to scale our solution as our number of clients and their respective employee headcounts increase

we maintain diverse loadbalanced internet lines serviced by multiple networks to provide our clients continuous access to our solution and their stored data we back up our client data at regular intervals utilizing live replication snapshots and cold archive 

 

 

methods of backup and manually monitor backup success and failure regularly our server cluster and database servers have redundant “hot swappable” disks to ensure continu ous service in the event of a disk failure 

operations

we physically host our solution for our clients in two secure data center facilities located in oklahoma and texas all of our critical systems are fully redundant and backedup in realtime to these facilities physical security includes idoriented access control alarm systems and manned 24houraday camera monitoring by our security guards server facilities also have environmental monitoring and extensive environmental controls such as heat and fire protection moisture temperature and humidity sensors backup power supply and exterior reinforced concrete walls

security

we maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of our clients’ data during the regular course of business we receive client data through our online system that we in turn process record and store following isoiec 2700012013 certified controls and procedures all communications with our servers that might contain sensitive information are encrypted before they leave the network and our servers are configured to only allow highgrade encryption algorithms

we strictly regulate and limit all access to servers and networks at each of our facilities local network access is restricted by our authenticated server using access control lists and remote network access is restricted by a firewall which provides no accessible route from external networks to systems within our local network we also employ network and host intrusion detection and prevention sensors throughout our infrastructure systems that monitor and alert on insecure installations of thirdparty applications a full system for managing and installing patches for those applications and highly restricted access to the internet for anyone who has access to client data our information security department regularly performs penetration testing and we retain a thirdparty penetration testing company to conduct penetration tests and periodic audits to identify and remediate any issues

our applications are secured using multiple libraries and secure coding practices our it infrastructure is secured and monitored using a number of best practices and tools at multiple layers of the physical and logical network this security is also continually monitored by our information security department all of our operations employees work in either our oklahoma or texas locations and with the exception of certain it personnel are not permitted to work remotely

software development

our application development team works closely with our clients to enhance our existing application offerings and develop new applications this process is led by experienced product managers who oversee the evolution of their respective applications within a focused timeframe of innovation and cultivation in order to deliver the welldeveloped applications and enhancements desired by our clients our product managers many of whom are former hr executives or members from the competitive landscape are proactive in their approach to assigning development requests based on research trends and user feedback a key element of our development process is the oneonone personal interaction between clients and our crrs through whom our clients personally suggest new applications and features

we develop our solution from the “ground up” with our internal development and engineering teams our development and engineering teams and our employees conceive new applications and enhancements review requests schedule development in order of priority and subsequently develop the applications or enhancements our new applications and enhancements are independently reviewed by the quality assurance team in accordance with our software development process before being fully implemented any enhancements to our applications are released on a monthly scheduled release date to coordinate the communication and release to our clients

capitalized software development expenses which include compensation for employees directly associated with development projects were 88 million 43 million and 22 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively

client service

we are committed to providing industryleading clientcentered service for this reason we assign each client a specialist within a dedicated team this oneonone service is a key part of our client service model and helps to ensure that we are delivering an industryleading solution and maintaining high client satisfaction the primary elements of our client service model include the following

streamlined setup and onboarding

after electing to deploy our solution a new client begins our onboarding process with assistance from a team of new client setup specialists and the sales professional responsible for obtaining the client’s business in addition we also have a team of transition specialists whose job it is to ensure that the process is performed smoothly data is collected properly and all relevant employees are fully trained on the system this team works closely with the client until the client is capable of managing our solution 

 

 

independently at which time responsibility for the client relationship is transferred to our dedicated crrs unlike cert ain of our competitors we do not outsource any of our onboarding efforts 

dedicated service specialists

after completing the onboarding process each client is assigned to a services specialist within a dedicated team clients can then contact their dedicated services specialist or a team member if any issues or questions arise these specialists provide personalized service with actual knowledge of the clients’ business needs when appropriate client questions can be elevated to the specialists with the appropriate application regulatory or tax expertise in addition our crrs proactively contact our clients to ensure satisfaction with our solution and introduce additional applications

expert level service

our client specialists are trained across all of our applications to ensure that they can provide comprehensive expertlevel service our client service is iso 90012008 certified and helps support a high client retention rate

regulatory and certifications

we are subject to varying degrees of regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide services local laws and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement differ significantly among those jurisdictions these regulations and laws cover among others information disclosure

personal privacy has become a significant issue in the united states and in other countries the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future many federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations affecting or regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information in the united states these include for example rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca and state breach notification laws

we voluntarily obtain thirdparty security examinations relating to security and data privacy in accordance with statement on standards for attestation engagements “ssae” no 16 reporting on controls at a service organization our ssae examination is conducted every six months by one of the four largest independent international auditing firms and addresses among other areas our physical and environmental safeguards for production data centers data availability and integrity procedures change management procedures and logical security procedures

in october 2016 we renewed a certification based on isoiec 270012013 criteria a security standard for information security management systems published by iso covering our production quality assurance and implementation environments this independent assessment of our conformity to the iso 27001 standard includes assessing security risks designing and implementing comprehensive security controls and adopting an information security management process to meet security needs on an ongoing basis the certification is valid until december 2019 with continuing assessments taking place annually

in march 2014 we renewed a certification based on iso 90012008 criteria a standard for the implementation of quality management processes published by iso covering our activities required to create and deliver our solution this independent assessment of our conformity to the iso 9001 standard includes assessing the design and implementation of quality objectives to meet delivery standards on an ongoing basis the certification is valid until april 2017 with continuing assessments taking place annually

intellectual property

we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights we also have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we do not have any patents or patent applications pending

 

 

seasonality 

our revenues are seasonal in nature recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs such as bonuses for our clients because payroll forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year first quarter revenues and margins are generally higher than in subsequent quarters further we generated additional revenues in the first quarter of 2016 because as a result of the enactment of the aca many clients were required to file forms 1094 and 1095 prior to march 31 2016 we anticipate that our revenues will continue to exhibit this seasonal pattern for so long as the aca or replacement legislation includes employer reporting requirements in addition we often experience increased revenues during the fourth quarter due to unscheduled payroll runs for our clients that occur before the end of the year therefore we expect the seasonality of our revenue cycle to decrease to the extent clients utilize more of our nonpayroll applications

employees

our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees is critical to our continued success we invest heavily in our training and leadership development programs to encourage the development and promotion of our employees as of december 31 2016 we employed 2075 people none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

facilities

our corporate headquarters is an approximately 250000squarefoot campus located on over 30 acres of companyowned property in oklahoma city oklahoma in addition to housing a fully redundant data center at our corporate headquarters we operate another fully redundant data center at a leased property near dallas texas we also lease a disaster recovery site in downtown oklahoma city 

we also lease offices in arizona california colorado connecticut florida georgia illinois indiana maryland massachusetts michigan minnesota missouri new jersey new york north carolina ohio oklahoma oregon pennsylvania tennessee texas virginia and washington we believe that these facilities are suitable for our current operations and upon the expiration of the terms of the leases we believe we could renew these leases or find suitable space elsewhere on acceptable terms

ri sk factors 

tableend

the risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this form 10k including those risks identified in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” describe examples of risks uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statement if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect actual outcomes may vary materially from those included in this form 10k

risks related to our business and industry

our business depends substantially on our clients’ continued use of our applications their purchases of additional applications from us and our ability to add new clients any decline in our clients’ continued use of our applications or purchases of additional applications could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

in order for us to maintain or improve our operating results it is important that our current clients continue to use our applications and purchase additional applications from us and that we add new clients our clients have no obligation to continue to use our applications and may choose not to continue to use our applications at the same or higher level of service if at all in the past some of our clients have elected not to continue to use our applications moreover our clients generally have the right to cancel their agreements with us for any or no reason by providing 30 days’ prior written notice

our client retention rates may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the level of client satisfaction with our applications pricing the prices of competing products or services mergers and acquisitions affecting our client base reduced hiring by our clients or reductions in our clients’ spending levels if our clients do not continue to use our applications renew on less favorable terms or fail to purchase additional applications or if we fail to add new clients our revenues may decline and our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected

if our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to our clients’ or their employees’ sensitive data is otherwise obtained our solution may not be perceived as being secure clients may reduce the use of or stop using our solution our ability to attract new clients may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities

our solution involves the collection storage and transmission of clients’ and their employees’ confidential and proprietary information including personal or identifying information as well as financial and payroll data hcm software is increasingly being targeted in cyberattacks including computer viruses worms phishing attacks malicious software programs and other information security breaches which could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our clients’ sensitive data or otherwise disrupt our clients’ or other third parties’ business operations if cybercriminals are able to circumvent our security measures or if we are unable to detect an intrusion into our systems and contain such intrusion in a reasonable amount of time our clients’ sensitive data may be compromised

certain of our employees have access to sensitive information about our clients’ employees while we conduct background checks of our employees and limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls resulting in a security breach 

although we have security measures in place to protect client information and prevent data loss and other security breaches these measures could be breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently we may not be able to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative or protective measures while we currently maintain a cyber liability insurance policy cyber liability insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our cyber liability insurance policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention

any actual or perceived breach of our security could damage our reputation cause existing clients to discontinue the use of our solution prevent us from attracting new clients or subject us to thirdparty lawsuits regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

any interruption or failure of our data centers could impair our ability to effectively provide our solution and adversely affect our business

we serve all of our clients from our two data centers located in oklahoma and texas these locations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from severe weather tornados terrorist attacks earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses or cyberattacks they are also subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct our solution depends on the continuing operation of our data centers and any damage to or failure of our data centers could result in interruptions in our services any interruption in our service including adverse changes in service levels at our data centers could damage our reputation and consequently our ability to attract new clients cause our clients to terminate their use of our solution and 

 

 

prevent us from gaining new or additional business from current clients which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

the market in which we participate is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected

the market for hcm software is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented we expect competition to intensify in the future with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants many of our current and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition longer operating histories more established relationships in the industry and significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as a result some of these competitors may be able to















some of our principal competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures similarly some competitors offer different billing terms which has resulted in pressures on our billing terms if we are unable to maintain our pricing levels and our billing terms our operating results would be negatively impacted in addition pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales reduced margins losses or the failure of our solution to maintain widespread market acceptance any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

we compete with firms that provide hcm solutions by various means many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software but as demand for greater flexibility and access to information grows we believe there will be increased competition in the delivery of hcm cloudbased solutions by other saas providers our competitors offer hcm solutions that overlap with one several or all categories of applications that we offer our talent acquisition and talent management applications compete primarily with cornerstone ondemand inc oracle corporation sap se and workday inc our payroll applications including payroll processing compete primarily with adp ceridian concur technologies inc intuit inc paychex inc paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc our hr management applications compete primarily with adp ceridian oracle corporation paychex inc paylocity holding corporation sap se and workday inc our time and labor management applications compete primarily with adp ceridian kronos incorporated paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc most of our larger competitors compete with us across multiple application categories in addition our hcm solution continues to face competition from inhouse payroll and hr systems and departments as well as hr systems and software sold by thirdparty vendors

competition in the hcm solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness application quality and reputation breadth of service and product offering and price many of our competitors have established marketing relationships access to larger client bases and major distribution agreements with consultants software vendors and distributors in addition some competitors may offer software that addresses one or a limited number of hcm functions at a lower price point or with greater depth than our solution further some potential clients particularly large enterprises may elect to develop their own internal solutions if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected

we have historically derived a majority of our revenues from payroll processing and our efforts to increase the use of our other hcm applications may not be successful and may reduce our revenue growth rate

to date we have derived a majority of our revenues from payroll processing compared to payroll processing our participation in certain other hcm applications markets is relatively new and it is uncertain whether our revenues from other hcm applications will continue to grow the uncertainty regarding the adoption of any new applications beyond our existing applications may make it difficult to evaluate our business our hcm solution may not achieve and sustain the high level of market acceptance that is critical for the continued success of our business the failure to increase the use of our hcm applications and any new applications developed by us may reduce our revenue growth rate which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

 

 

 

any significant disruption in our saas network infrastructure could harm our reputation and expose us to significant costs

our saas network infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations our clients access our solution through standard web browsers smart phones tablets and other webenabled devices and depend on us for fast and reliable access to our solution in the future we may experience disruptions in our computing and communications infrastructure factors that may cause such disruptions include

















if our saas network infrastructure or our clients’ ability to access our solution is interrupted client and employee data from recent transactions may be permanently lost and we could be exposed to significant claims by clients particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds due to employees any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to retain clients and sell our solution which would adversely impact our revenues

we have also experienced significant growth in the number of clients and transactions and the amount of client and employee data that our network infrastructure supports we seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our network infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our clients and their employees and to facilitate the rapid provision of new client deployments and the expansion of existing client deployments any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our network infrastructure could adversely affect our reputation and may result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our solution any interruptions in the availability of our solution might reduce our revenues cause us to issue refunds to clients or adversely affect our retention of existing clients which could have a negative impact on our business or financial condition

if our solution fails to perform properly our reputation could be adversely affected and our market share could decline

our solution is inherently complex and may in the future contain or develop undetected defects or errors any defects in our applications could adversely affect our reputation impair our ability to sell our applications in the future and result in significant costs to us the costs incurred in correcting any application defects may be substantial and could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition any defects in functionality or that cause interruptions in the availability of our applications could result in













because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our clients regard as significant our clients might assert claims against us in the future alleging that they suffered damages due to a defect error or other failure of our solution our errors and omissions insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention any failures in the performance of our solution could harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients which would have an adverse impact on our business operating results or financial condition

 

 

if we do not effectively expand and train ou r sales force and our support teams we may be unable to add new clients and retain existing clients 

we need to continue to expand our sales force and support team members in order to grow our client base and increase our revenues to continue to execute our growth strategy we must also attract and retain qualified sales marketing and operational personnel capable of supporting a larger and more diverse client base identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use of our applications requires significant time expense and attention and it can take a substantial amount of time before our sales representatives and support team members are fullytrained and productive we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we currently or intend in the future to do business and our recent hires and planned hires may not achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time or become as productive as we expect if our expansion efforts are unsuccessful or do not generate a corresponding increase in revenues our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected

our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth and organizational change if we fail to manage such growth and change effectively we may be unable to execute our business plan maintain high levels of service or adequately address competitive challenges

we have experienced and may continue to experience rapid growth in our headcount and operations which has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management operational and financial resources for example our headcount has grown from 523 employees as of december 31 2011 to 2075 employees as of december 31 2016 and we have expanded from 20 sales teams as of december 31 2011 to 42 sales teams as of january 31 2017 we have also experienced significant growth in the number of clients and transactions and the amount of client and employee data that our infrastructure supports finally our organizational structure and recording systems and procedures are becoming more complex as we improve our operational financial and management controls our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth and organizational change effectively to manage the expected growth of our headcount and operations we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures our ability to add additional offices may be constrained by the willingness and availability of qualified personnel to staff and manage any new offices the failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulties or delays in obtaining clients selling additional applications to our clients declines in quality or client satisfaction of our applications increases in costs and difficulties in introducing new applications or other operational difficulties any of which could adversely affect our business by impairing our ability to retain and attract clients or sell additional applications to our existing clients

if we are not able to develop enhancements and new applications keep pace with technological developments or respond to future disruptive technologies we might not remain competitive and our business could be adversely affected

our continued success will depend on our ability to adapt and innovate to attract new clients and increase revenues from existing clients we need to enhance add new features to and improve our existing applications and introduce new applications the success of any enhancements or new features and applications depends on several factors including timely completion introduction and market acceptance we may expend significant time and resources developing and pursuing sales of a particular enhancement or application that may not result in revenues in the anticipated time frame or at all or may not result in revenue growth sufficient to offset increased expenses further changing regulatory requirements may delay the development or introduction of enhancements or new applications or render certain of our applications obsolete if we are unable to successfully develop enhancements new features or new applications to meet client needs our business and operating results could be adversely affected

in addition because our applications are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using internet tools and protocols we will need to continuously modify and enhance our applications to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies if we are unable to respond in a timely and costeffective manner to these rapid technological developments our current and future applications may become less marketable and less competitive or even obsolete

our success is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver hcm solutions at lower prices more efficiently or more conveniently such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete

the market for our solution among large companies may be limited if these companies demand customized features and functions that we do not offer

prospective clients especially larger companies may require customized features and functions unique to their business processes that we do not offer in order to ensure we meet these requirements we may devote a significant amount of support and services resources to larger prospective clients increasing the cost and time required to complete sales with no guarantee that these prospective clients will adopt our solution further we may not be successful in implementing any customized features or functions if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we do not offer or that would be difficult for them to deploy themselves the market for our solution will be more limited and our business could be adversely affected

 

 

we m ay encounter long sales cycles with larger prospective clients which could adversely affect our operating results in a given period 

we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients we serve and to increase our revenues per client to further capitalize on this opportunity we intend to pursue larger businesses opportunistically within our target client size range where our current sales model is effective as we target our sales efforts at larger clients we will face longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales in the large enterprise market the clients’ decision to use our applications may be an enterprisewide decision and therefore these types of sales will require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our applications in addition our target clients may prefer to purchase applications that are critical to their business from one of our larger more established competitors our typical sales cycles are 30 to 90 days and we expect that our average sales cycle may gradually trend towards the higher end of this range as we pursue larger clients longer sales cycles could cause our operating and financial results to suffer in a given period

our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our deployment or technical support services

our business depends on our ability to satisfy our clients both with respect to our applications and the technical support provided to help clients use the applications that address the needs of their businesses we use our inhouse deployment personnel to implement and configure our solution and provide support to our clients if a client is not satisfied with the quality of our solution or the applications delivered or the support provided we could incur additional costs to address the situation our profitability might be negatively affected and the client’s dissatisfaction with our deployment service could damage our ability to sell additional applications to that client in addition our sales process is highly dependent on the reputation of our solution and applications and on positive recommendations from our existing clients any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality technical support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell our applications to existing and prospective clients and as a result our business operating results or financial condition

we are dependent on the continued service of our key executives and if we fail to retain such key executives our business could be adversely affected

we believe that our success depends in part on the continued services of our senior management team consisting of chad richison craig e boelte jeffrey d york william x kerber iii and stacey pezold our business could be adversely affected if we fail to retain these key executives although the employment arrangements with each of our key executives contain noncompetition restrictions our business could nonetheless be adversely affected if a key executive leaves paycom and attempts to compete with us in addition we have not purchased key person life insurance on any members of our senior management team 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel including software developers and skilled it specialists our ability to develop new products and in turn increase our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected

because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new applications we are heavily dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified software developers and it personnel with the requisite education background and industry experience the software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors this competition for qualified personnel may be amplified by new immigration laws or policies that could limit software companies’ ability to recruit internationally although such changes in immigration laws or policies would not have a significant direct impact on our workforce the ensuing increase in demand for software developers and it personnel could impair our ability to attract or retain skilled employees andor significantly increase our costs to do so further the loss of the services of a significant number of our developers could be disruptive to our development efforts which may adversely affect our business by causing us to lose clients increase operating expenses or divert management’s attention to recruit replacements for the departed employees

our financial results may fluctuate due to many factors some of which may be beyond our control

our results of operations including the levels of our revenues costs of revenues administrative expenses operating income cash flow and deferred revenue may vary significantly in the future and the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance fluctuations in our financial results may negatively impact the value of our common stock our financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control and as a result may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate from period to period include without limitation







 

 



























certain of our operating results and financial metrics may be difficult to predict as a result of seasonality

we have historically experienced seasonality in our revenues because a significant portion of our recurring revenues relate to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 and beginning in 2016 the annual processing and filing of acarelated forms because these forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year first quarter revenues are generally higher than subsequent quarters in addition unscheduled payroll runs at the end of the year such as bonuses often result in increased revenues in the fourth quarter we expect this seasonality to continue in the future although the repeal or modification of the aca could have an impact on the seasonality of our revenues nonetheless the seasonal fluctuations in certain of our operating results and financial metrics may make such results and metrics difficult to predict

if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights our competitive advantage could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets generate reduced revenues or incur costly litigation to protect our rights

our success is dependent in part upon our intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and to protect our intellectual property rights however the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our applications and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products or services that compete with ours

we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property we have been involved in litigation in the past and litigation may be necessary in the future to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets such litigation could be costly timeconsuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights we may not be able to secure protect and enforce our intellectual property rights or control access to and the distribution of our solution and proprietary information which could affect our business

if the saas market develops more slowly than we expect or declines our growth may slow or stall and our business could be adversely affected

the saas market is not as mature as the market for on premise enterprise software and it is uncertain whether saas will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance our success depends not only on strong demand for hcm services in general but also to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of saas many companies have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to saas it is difficult to predict client adoption rates and demand for our solution the future growth rate and size of the saas 

 

 

market or the entry of competitive products the expansion of the saas market depends on a number of factors including the cost pe rformance and perceived value associated with saas as well as the ability of saas providers to address security and privacy concerns if other saas providers experience security incidents loss of client data disruptions in delivery or other problems th e market for saas applications as a whole including our solution may be negatively affected if there is a reduction in demand for saas caused by a lack of client acceptance technological challenges weakening economic conditions security or privacy co ncerns competing technologies and products decreases in corporate spending or otherwise our growth may slow or stall and our business could be adversely affected 

we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights

considerable intellectual property development activity exists in our industry and we expect that software developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of applications and competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps our competitors as well as a number of other entities and individuals may own or claim to own intellectual property in technology areas relating to our solution or applications in addition we may increasingly be subject to trademark infringement claims as our presence grows in the marketplace from time to time third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights a claim of infringement may also be made relating to technology that we acquire or license from third parties however we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover or may be alleged to cover some or all of our solution applications or brands

the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable and as a result any future litigation or claim of infringement could i cause us to enter into an unfavorable royalty or license agreement pay ongoing royalties or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms ii require us to discontinue the sale of our solution or applications iii require us to indemnify our clients or thirdparty service providers or iv require us to expend additional development resources to redesign our solution or applications any of these outcomes could harm our business even if we were to prevail any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business and operations

we employ thirdparty licensed software for use in our applications and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs or reduced service levels which could adversely affect our business

our applications incorporate certain thirdparty software obtained under licenses from other companies we anticipate that we will continue to rely on such thirdparty software and development tools from third parties in the future although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the thirdparty software we currently license this may not always be the case or it may be difficult or costly to replace in addition incorporating the software used in our applications with new thirdparty software may require significant work and substantial investment of our time and resources also to the extent that our applications depend upon the successful operation of thirdparty software in conjunction with our software any undetected errors or defects in this thirdparty software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our applications delay new application introductions result in a failure of our applications and harm our reputation

the use of open source software in our applications may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property rights

some of our applications use software covered by open source licenses from time to time there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate such software into their products or applications as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software litigation could be costly for us to defend have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional development resources to change our applications in addition if we were to combine our applications with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain of the open source licenses be required to release the source code of our applications if we inappropriately use open source software we may be required to redesign our applications discontinue the sale of our applications or take other remedial actions which could adversely impact our business operating results or financial condition

we may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development activities for several years if at all

developing saasbased applications is expensive and the investment in the development of these applications often involves a longterm return on our investment we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development activities accelerated application introductions and short software life cycles require increased levels of research and development expenditures that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by increased revenues we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development activities to maintain our competitive position we may not receive significant revenues from these investments however for several years if at all

the failure to develop our brand costeffectively could have an adverse effect on our business

we believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a costeffective manner is critical to achieving the widespread acceptance of our solution and is an important element in attracting new clients and retaining existing clients successful promotion of our brand depends largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful applications at competitive prices brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues and even if they 

 

 

do any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brand if we fail to successfully promote and maintain o ur brand or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand we may fail to attract enough new clients or retain our existing clients to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding effo rts which could have an adverse effect on our business 

our outstanding indebtedness is subject to certain operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities and may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business

as of december 31 2016 our indebtedness consisted of i a term note under the 2021 consolidated loan due to kirkpatrick bank the “2021 consolidated loan” with an outstanding principal balance of 250 million and ii an 84month term loan from kirkpatrick bank the “2023 term loan” with an outstanding principal balance of 49 million in august 2016 we also entered into a construction loan with kirkpatrick bank which is available to finance the ongoing construction of a fourth headquarters building and new parking garage the “2016 construction loan” as of december 31 2016 we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the 2016 construction loan pursuant to the terms of both the 2021 consolidated loan and the 2023 term loan we may not subject to certain exceptions



















to the extent we borrow under the 2016 construction loan the foregoing covenants will also apply until all such amounts are repaid in addition under the 2021 consolidated loan the 2023 term loan and the 2016 construction loan collectively the “loan agreements” we are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” to fixed charges defined as current maturities of longterm debt interest expense rent expense and distributions of greater than 12 to 10 which is measured on a quarterly basis the operating and financial covenants in the loan agreements as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into may restrict our ability to finance our operations engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies we may also be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on our debt which would reduce the amount of money we have for operations working capital expansion or other general corporate purposes

our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations and comply with the operating and financial covenants may be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to control many of these factors and comply with these covenants a breach of any of the covenants under the loan agreements could result in an event of default which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under the loan agreements to become immediately due and payable

we may acquire other businesses applications or technologies which could divert our management’s attention result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results

in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses applications or technologies that we believe complement or expand our applications enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities the pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur expenses in identifying investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions whether or not they are ultimately consummated

we do not have any experience in acquiring other businesses if we acquire additional businesses we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel operations and technologies successfully or to effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition we also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors including







 

 

















in addition a significant portion of the purchase price of any companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets which must be assessed for impairment at least annually in the future if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process which could harm our results of operations acquisitions could also result in issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt which would result in dilution to our stockholders

our growth depends in part on the success of our relationships with third parties

we rely on thirdparty financial and accounting processing systems as well as various financial institutions to perform financial services in connection with our applications such as providing automated clearing house “ach” and wire transfers as part of our payroll and expense reimbursement services and to provide technology and content support manufacture time clocks and process background checks we anticipate that we will continue to depend on various thirdparty relationships in order to grow our business provide technology and content support manufacture time clocks and process background checks identifying negotiating and documenting relationships with these third parties and integrating thirdparty content and technology requires significant time and resources our agreements with third parties typically are nonexclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors in addition these third parties may not perform as expected under our agreements and we may have disagreements or disputes with such third parties which could negatively affect our brand and reputation a global economic slowdown could also adversely affect the businesses of our thirdparty providers particularly those financial institutions that process transactions through the ach network and it is possible that they may not be able to devote the resources we expect to our relationship

if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected even if we are successful these relationships may not result in improved operating results

adverse economic conditions could affect our business operating results or financial condition

our business depends on the overall demand for hcm applications and on the economic health of our current and prospective clients if economic conditions in the united states or in global markets remain uncertain or deteriorate clients may cease their operations delay or reduce their spending on hcm and other outsourcing services or attempt to renegotiate their contracts with us this could result in reductions in sales of our applications longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition in addition hcm spending levels may not increase following any recovery

in addition as part of our payroll and tax filing application we collect and then remit client funds to taxing authorities and accounts designated by our clients during the interval between receipt and disbursement we may invest such funds in money market funds demand deposit accounts certificates of deposit and commercial paper these investments are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks and such risks may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility any loss of or inability to access such funds could have an adverse impact on our cash position and results of operations and could require us to obtain additional sources of liquidity which may not be available on reasonable terms if at all

if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings

we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as of december 31 2016 we had recorded a total of 519 million of goodwill and 19 million of other intangible assets an adverse change in domestic or global market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of our critical assumptions or estimates made in connection with the impairment testing of goodwill or 

 

 

intangible assets could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge to our goodwill or other intangible assets any such materi al charges may have a negative impact our operating results 

we typically pay employees and may pay taxing authorities amounts due for a payroll period before a client’s electronic funds transfers are finally settled to our account if client payments are rejected by banking institutions or otherwise fail to clear into our accounts we may require additional sources of shortterm liquidity and our operating results could be adversely affected

our payroll processing application moves significant funds from the account of a client to employees and relevant taxing authorities for larger funding amounts we require clients to transfer the funds to us via fed wire for smaller funding amounts we debit a client’s account prior to any disbursement on its behalf and due to ach banking regulations funds previously credited could be reversed under certain circumstances and time frames after our payment of amounts due to employees and taxing and other regulatory authorities there is therefore a risk that the employer’s funds will be insufficient to cover the amounts we have already paid on its behalf while such shortage and accompanying financial exposure has only occurred in very limited circumstances in the past should clients default on their payment obligations in the future we might be required to advance substantial funds to cover such obligations in such an event we may be required to seek additional sources of shortterm liquidity which may not be available on reasonable terms if at all and our operating results and our liquidity could be adversely affected and our banking relationships could be harmed

because our longterm success depends in part on our ability to expand the sales of our solution to clients located outside of the united states our business will be subject to risks associated with international operations

an element of our growth strategy is to expand our operations and client base to date we have not engaged in any operations outside of the united states if we decide to expand our operations into international markets it will require significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory economic and political risks that are different from those in the united states because of our lack of experience with international operations we cannot ensure that our international expansion efforts will be successful and the impact of such expansion efforts may adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

risks related to legislation or regulation

the modification or repeal of certain provisions of the aca could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

beginning in 2016 we generate acarelated revenues i on an annual basis in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients and ii from clients who have purchased our enhanced aca application as part of the fixed bundled price charged per billing period on january 20 2017 president donald j trump issued an executive order stating that it is the policy of the new administration to seek the prompt repeal of the aca many uncertainties exist regarding the immediate impact of this executive order as well as when and if the aca will ultimately be modified or repealed nonetheless the modification or repeal of certain provisions of the aca could harm our business operating results and financial condition if the aca is modified to eliminate the employer reporting requirements or if the aca is repealed and replaced with new legislation that does not include similar employer reporting requirements we will no longer generate revenues in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients further uncertainty regarding the potential future modification repeal or replacement of the aca could adversely affect our ability to sell our enhanced aca application to new clients we expect that as of march 1 2017 we will have collected the majority of our anticipated revenues from processing and filing clients’ acarelated forms for the 2016 fiscal year and estimate that approximately 3 of our projected total revenues for the year ending december 31 2017 would be eliminated if as a result of a hypothetical repeal or modification of the aca we did not collect any additional acarelated revenues after march 1 2017 

privacy concerns and laws or other domestic regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our applications

our applications require the storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential information of our clients and their employees including personal or identifying information as well as their financial and payroll data our applications are subject to various complex government laws and regulations on the federal state and local levels including those governing personal privacy which has become a significant issue in the united states the regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future many federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information in the united states these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca federal and state labor and employment laws and state data breach notification laws failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition

in addition to government regulation privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different selfregulatory standards because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws are still uncertain it is possible that these 

 

 

laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our solution any failure to comply with government regulations that apply to our applications including privacy and data protection laws could subject us to liability in addition to the possibility of fines lawsuits and other claims we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our solution which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition any inability to adequately address privacy concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws regulations and policies could result in additional cost and liability to us damage our reputation inhibit sales and adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

furthermore privacy concerns may cause our clients’ employees to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our clients and their employees to use our applications effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our applications in certain industries all of these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the ability of our clients to process handle store use and transmit demographic and personal information from their employees which could reduce demand for our applications

changes in laws government regulations and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

many of our applications are designed to assist our clients in complying with government regulations that continually change changes in laws regulations or policies could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for certain of our existing applications which would result in decreased revenues further we may spend time and money developing new applications and enhancements that due to regulatory changes become unnecessary prior to being released the introduction of new regulatory or licensing requirements or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations could also increase our cost of doing business and changing regulatory requirements may make the introduction of new applications and enhancements more costly or more timeconsuming than we currently anticipate or prevent the introduction of new applications and enhancements by us altogether in addition any failure to educate and assist our clients with respect to new or revised legislation that impacts them could have an adverse effect on our reputation and any failure to modify our applications or develop new applications in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

changes in laws and regulations related to the internet or changes in the internet infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for our applications and could have a negative impact on our business

the future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the internet as a primary medium for commerce communication and business federal state and foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet as a commercial medium changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our applications in order to comply with these changes in addition government agencies or private organizations may impose taxes fees or other charges for accessing the internet or commerce conducted via the internet these laws or charges could limit the growth of internetrelated commerce or communications generally or result in reductions in the demand for internetbased applications such as ours

in addition the use of the internet as a means of conducting business could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of internet activity security reliability cost ease of use accessibility and quality of service the performance of the internet has been adversely affected by “viruses” “worms” and similar malicious programs and the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure if the use of the internet is adversely affected by these issues demand for our applications could suffer which could adversely affect our business

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected

as a public company we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements management must evaluate and furnish a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and our auditors must attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting

if we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated compliance with the public company requirements has made some activities more timeconsuming costly and complicated if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports andor we could become subject to investigations by the new york stock exchange the “nyse” the sec or other regulatory authorities and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected

 

 

adverse tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our clients which could increase the costs of our solution and applications and could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

as a vendor of services we are ordinarily held responsible by taxing authorities for collecting and paying any applicable sales or other similar taxes additionally the application of federal state and local tax laws to services provided electronically like ours is evolving new income sales use or other tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time possibly with retroactive effect and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services and applications provided over the internet these enactments could adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and ultimately could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that change over time we review these rules and regulations periodically and when we believe we are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state we may voluntarily engage state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with that state’s rules and regulations we cannot ensure that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we currently believe no such taxes are required 

in addition existing tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be interpreted changed modified or applied adversely to us possibly with retroactive effect which could require us or our clients to pay additional tax amounts as well as require us or our clients to pay fines or penalties and substantial interest for past amounts if we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our clients we could be held liable for such costs thereby adversely affecting our business operating results or financial condition additionally the imposition of such taxes on us would effectively increase the cost of our software and services we provide to clients and would likely have a negative impact on our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the jurisdictions in which such taxes are imposed

risks related to ownership of our common stock

our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance

from timetotime we have released and may continue to release guidance in our earnings conference calls earnings releases or otherwise regarding our future performance which represents our estimates as of the date of release this guidance which includes forwardlooking statements has been and will be based on projections prepared by our management these projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections accordingly no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections

projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that while presented with numerical specificity are inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control projections are also based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions some of which will change the principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any third parties

guidance is necessarily speculative in nature and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will vary significantly from actual results accordingly our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material in light of the foregoing investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock

any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this “risk factors” section in this form 10k could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance and the differences may be adverse and material

the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the current market price

the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future if an active trading market for our common stock is not sustained you may have difficulty selling any shares of our common stock that you purchased and the value of such shares may be materially impaired the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including







 

 















in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies in the past stockholders have filed securities class actions following periods of market volatility if we were to become involved in securities litigation it could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline

the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if no or few securities or industry analysts cover our company the trading price for our common stock would be negatively impacted if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes incorrect or unfavorable research about our business our common stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our common stock could decrease which could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline

the issuance of additional stock in connection with acquisitions our stock incentive plans warrants or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to one hundred million shares of common stock and up to ten million shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations we may issue all of these shares that are not already outstanding without any action or approval by our stockholders we intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions in the future we may pay for such acquisitions partly or in full through the issuance of additional equity securities

any issuance of shares in connection with an acquisition the exercise of stock options or warrants the award of shares of restricted stock or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by our existing stockholders

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management

any provision of our certificate of incorporation bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

generally accepted accounting principles in the united states are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this “form 10k” the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties see part i “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” for a discussion of the uncertainties risks and assumptions associated with those statements actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward looking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10k particularly in the section entitled “risk factors” unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires the terms “we” “us” “our” and the “company” refer to paycom software inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 

overview

we are a leading provider of comprehensive cloudbased human capital management “hcm” software delivered as softwareasaservice we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions including talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and human resources “hr” management applications our userfriendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees enabling selfmanagement of their hcm activities in the cloud which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity

we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry we have over 17800 clients none of which constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 we stored data for more than 27 million persons employed by our clients during the year ended december 31 2016

our revenues are primarily generated through our sales force that solicits new clients and our client relations representatives who sell additional applications to existing clients we have 42 sales teams located in 24 states and plan to open additional sales offices to further expand our presence in the us market during the year ended december 31 2016 we opened six new sales offices with one new sales office located in each of chicago cleveland pasadena sacramento san antonio and stamford our continued growth depends on attracting new clients through further penetration of our existing markets geographic expansion and the introduction of new applications to our existing client base we also expect that changes in certain factors affecting our performance will correlate with improvement or deterioration in the labor market our principal marketing programs include email campaigns social and digital media search engine marketing methods and tradeshows

during the last three years we have developed several new applications we believe our ability to continue to develop new applications and to improve existing applications will enable us to increase revenues in the future and the number of our new applications adopted by our clients has been a significant factor in our revenue growth over the last three years

trends opportunities and challenges

our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications as a result of our evolving revenue mix as clients add more nonpayroll applications coupled with the unique client benefits that our solution provides  eg  enabling our clients to scale the number of hcm applications that they use on an asneeded basis we are presented with a variety of opportunities and challenges

we generate revenues from i fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed or ii fixed amounts charged per billing period we do not require clients to enter into longterm contractual commitments with us our billing period varies by client based on when they pay their employees which is either weekly biweekly semimonthly or monthly

for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 our gross margins were approximately 84 84 and 82 respectively although our gross margins may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonality and hiring trends we expect that our gross margins will remain relatively consistent in future periods

growing our business has also resulted in and will continue to result in substantial investment in sales professionals operating expenses systems development and programming costs and general and administrative expenses which has and will continue to increase our expenses we intend to obtain new clients by i continuing to expand our presence in metropolitan areas where we currently have an existing sales office through adding sales teams or offices and increasing the number of our sales professionals and ii opening sales offices in new metropolitan areas our ability to increase revenues and improve operating results depends on our ability to add new clients

the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations and increased the number of applications we offer based on our total revenues we have grown at an approximately 44 cagr from january 1 2012 through 

 

 

december 31 2016 because we charge our clients on a per employee basis for certain services we provide any increase or decrease in the number of employees that our clients ha ve will have a positive or negative impact respectively on our results of operations our solution requires no adjustment to serve larger clients we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of potential clients and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost to us 

we believe the challenges of managing the everchanging complexity of payroll and human resources will continue to drive companies to turn to outsourced providers for help with their hcm needs the hcm industry historically has been driven in part by legislation and regulatory action including cobra changes to the minimum wage laws or overtime rules and legislation from federal state or municipal taxation authorities the implementation of the affordable care act the “aca” is the most recent example of legislation that has created demand in the hcm industry we generate acarelated revenues i on an annual basis in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients and ii from clients who have purchased our enhanced aca application as part of the fixed bundled price charged per billing period while we generally do not track our revenues on an applicationbyapplication basis because applications are often sold in various groupings and configurations for a single price we estimate that if the aca is not modified or repealed revenues from our enhanced aca application and aca forms filings business will represent approximately 5 of total projected revenues for the year ending december 31 2017

throughout our history we have built strong relationships with our clients as the hcm needs of our clients evolve we believe that we are wellpositioned to gain additional share of the hcm spending of our clients and we believe this opportunity is significant to be successful we must continue to demonstrate the operational and economic benefits of our solution as well as effectively hire train motivate and retain qualified personnel

provision for income taxes

for the twelve months ended december 31 2016 income tax expense decreased as a percentage of revenue compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2015 the decrease primarily resulted from the recognition of excess tax benefits from sharebased payment awards due to the company’s adoption of accounting standards update no 201609 “compensation – stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” “asu 201609” see note 2 under adoption of new pronouncements for further discussion in connection with the adoption of asu 201609

quarterly revenues trends

excluding changes in quarterly revenues due to seasonal factors our quarterly revenues increased sequentially for the periods presented due to a combination of factors including the addition of clients in mature sales offices as well as contributions from sales offices that are reaching maturity the addition of new clients in more recently opened sales offices and the sale of additional applications to our existing clients there are also seasonal factors that affect our revenues recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 as well as the processing and filing of acarelated forms because these forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year first quarter revenue and margins are generally higher than subsequent quarters in addition unscheduled payroll runs at the end of the year often result in increased revenue in the fourth quarter 

quarterly expenses trends

sales and marketing expenses are generally higher in the fourth and first quarters as sales representatives achieve sales goals throughout the year resulting in higher commission rates these sales goals reset annually on february 1

liquidity and capital resources

our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents which totaled 602 million and 507 million as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively our cash and cash equivalents are comprised primarily of demand deposit accounts 

 

 

money market funds and certificates of deposit we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months 

we have historically financed our operations from cash flows generated from operations cash from the sale of debt and equity securities and borrowings under our loans since inception we have raised 1251 million of equity capital 643 million of which was the net proceeds raised in our initial public offering that closed in april 2014 we incurred related party debt as part of corporate reorganizations that occurred in april 2012 and january 2014 such debt has since been repaid although we have funded most of the costs for ongoing construction projects at our corporate headquarters from available cash we have incurred indebtedness for a portion of these costs further to date all purchases under our stock repurchase plan have been paid for from available cash and to the extent we repurchase additional shares in the future we expect to continue to use cash

recent liquidity developments

cash flow analysis

our cash flows from operating activities have historically been significantly impacted by profitability implementation revenues received but deferred research and development and our investment in sales and marketing to drive growth our ability to meet future liquidity needs will be driven by our operating performance and the extent of continued investment in our operations failure to generate sufficient revenues and related cash flows could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our liquidity needs and achieve our business objectives

as our business grows we expect our capital expenditures and our investment activity to continue to increase depending on certain growth opportunities we may choose to accelerate investments in sales and marketing acquisitions technology and services actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our future revenues cash from operating activities and the level of expenditures in all areas of our business and may use available cash to repurchase shares of our common stock

as part of our payroll and payroll tax filing services we collect funds from our clients for federal state and local employment taxes which we remit to the appropriate tax agencies we invest these funds in money market funds demand deposit accounts commercial paper and certificates of deposit from which we earn interest income during the period between their receipt and disbursement

our cash flows from investing and financing activities are influenced by the amount of funds held for clients which varies significantly from quarter to quarter the balance of the funds we hold depends on our clients’ payroll calendars and therefore such balance changes from period to period in accordance with the timing of each payroll cycle 

our cash flows from financing activities are also affected by the extent to which we use available cash to purchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase plan as well as restricted stock vesting events that may result in the company paying withholding taxes on behalf of certain employees

the following table summarizes the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014

offbalance sheet arrangements

as of december 31 2016 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results may materially differ from these estimates made by management under different assumptions and conditions

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are described below accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations

adoption of new pronouncements

in march 2016 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued asu 201609 which simplified the accounting related to certain aspects of sharebased payments to employees the new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recognized within the income statement when sharebased payment awards vest or are settled in addition cash flows related to excess tax benefits are not separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows in the statement of cash flows this guidance also allows us to repurchase more of an employee’s vesting shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting clarifies that all cash payments made to taxing authorities on an employee’s behalf for withheld shares be presented as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows and provides an accounting policy election to account for award forfeitures as they occur or continue to estimate forfeitures we elected to early adopt the new guidance in the third quarter of 2016 as such we are required to present any adjustments as of january 1 2016 the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption the primary impact of our adoption of asu 201609 was the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes of 70 million for the year ended december 31 2016 which otherwise would have been recognized as paid in capital early adoption had no impact on retained earnings as of january 1 2016 or on the comparability of the prior period financial statements as there were no excess tax benefits recognized during 2015 we elected to continue to estimate expected forfeitures to determine the amount of stock compensation cost to be recognized in each period the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess benefits and for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact on any of the periods previously presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

we adopted on a retrospective basis the recently issued guidance by the fasb accounting standards update no 201503 “interest – imputation of interest subtopic 83530 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs” “asu 201503” asu 201503 requires companies with debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to present such issuance costs in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability our adoption of asu 201503 resulted in a reclassification that decreased deposits and other assets by 01 million and decreased net longterm debt less current portion by 01 million on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2015 the adoption of asu 201503 had no impact on our stockholders’ equity or the results of our operations

revenue recognition

our total revenues are comprised of recurring revenues and implementation and other revenues we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting standards for software and service companies when all of the following criteria have been met









recurring revenues are derived primarily from our talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management applications these services are rendered during each client’s payroll period with the agreedupon fee being charged and collected as part of the client’s payroll revenues are recognized at time of billing of each client’s payroll period collectability is reasonably assured as the fees are collected through ach as part of the client’s payroll cycle or through direct wire 

 

 

transfer which minimizes the default risk our implementation and other revenues represent nonrefundable conversion fees which are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client setup and revenues from sale of time clocks as part of ou r employee time and attendance services because these conversion fees and sale of time clocks relate to our recurring revenues we have evaluated such arrangements under the accounting guidance that governs multiple element arrangements 

for arrangements with multiple elements we evaluate whether each element represents a separate unit of accounting in order to treat deliverables in a multiple element arrangement as separate units of accounting the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery if the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery we account for each deliverable separately and revenue is recognized for the respective deliverables as they are delivered if one or more of the deliverables does not have standalone value upon delivery the deliverables that do not have standalone value are generally combined with the final deliverable within the arrangement and treated as a single unit of accounting

for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 we determined that there was no standalone value associated with the upfront conversion fees as they did not have value to our clients on a standalone basis nor were they offered as an individual service therefore the conversion fees were deferred and are recognized ratably over the estimated life of our clients based on our historical client attrition rate which we estimate to be ten years revenues from the sale of time clocks are recognized when they are delivered

goodwill and other intangible assets

goodwill is not amortized but we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually or earlier if at the reporting unit level an indicator of impairment arises the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows if impairment exists a writedown to fair value is recorded our business is largely homogeneous and as a result goodwill is associated with one reporting unit we have selected june 30 as our annual goodwill impairment testing date and determined there was no impairment as of june 30 2016 for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 there were no indicators of impairment intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives

impairment of longlived assets

longlived assets including intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset we have determined that there is no impairment of longlived assets for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014

restricted common stock 

in connection with a corporate reorganization the “2014 reorganization” completed in anticipation of our initial public offering “ipo” on january 1 2014 we issued 8121101 shares of restricted stock the “2014 restricted stock” under the paycom software inc 2014 longterm incentive plan the “ltip” and 1148520 shares of common stock in each case upon conversion of outstanding incentive units of paycom payroll holdings llc “holdings” vested incentive units were converted to shares of common stock and 2014 restricted stock at various conversion ratios that ranged from approximately 102 to 124 unvested incentive units were converted to shares of 2014 restricted stock at various conversion ratios that ranged from 124 to 147 the conversion ratios were determined based on the underlying conditions of the preconversion incentive units and reflected any preexisting vesting conditions

given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock and incentive units prior to our ipo and in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants the “aicpa” audit and accounting practice aid series valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous factors existing at such time in order to determine the best estimate of the fair value of the 2014 restricted stock and incentive units including











 

 













we used a monte carlo simulation model to value the 2014 restricted stock and for restricted stock with marketbased vesting conditions issued after our ipo our simulation model requires various subjective assumptions as inputs including expected life volatility riskfree interest rates and the expected dividend yield the assumptions used in the simulation model represent our best estimates which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment as follows









the fasb accounting standards codification section 71820533 indicates that if the terms and conditions of an existing equity incentive compensation plan are to be modified then an entity should record additional compensation cost for any incremental value associated with the modification the incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess of the fair value of the modified awards over the fair value of the original awards immediately before its terms are modified based on the terms of the 2014 restricted stock we concluded that there was a modification of the existing equity incentive units based upon a valuation by an independent thirdparty management determined there was no additional compensation cost created in the conversion as the value of the incentive units given up was less than the value of the 2014 restricted stock received as such there was no additional compensation recorded 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we issued an aggregate of 741931 shares of restricted stock under the ltip to all of our executive officers and certain employees the “2015 restricted stock” during the year ended december 31 2016 we issued i an aggregate of 1575429 shares of restricted stock under the ltip to all of our executive officers certain employees and certain members of our board of directors the “2016 restricted stock” and collectively with the 2014 restricted stock and the 2015 restricted stock the “ltip stock” all shares of ltip stock are subject to either timebased or marketbased vesting conditions 

the following tables present a summary of the grantdate fair values and related assumptions with respect to shares of ltip stock the grantdate fair values were determined based on the monte carlo simulation model 



 

 

  

 



 

 



 

in addition to assumptions used in the simulation model we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our forfeiture estimate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover and other factors

the following table presents information about the ltip stock

 

 





shares of 2014 restricted stock that were subject to timebased vesting conditions retained substantially the same timebased vesting conditions as the respective tranche of incentive units from which they were converted the following tables show the vesting schedule for shares of 2014 restricted stock outstanding as of december 31 2016 that are subject to timebased vesting conditions

 



 

 

 

the following table shows the vesting schedule for shares of 2015 restricted stock and 2016 restricted stock outstanding as of december 31 2016 that are subject to timebased vesting conditions 

 



 

with respect to shares of 2014 restricted stock subject to marketbased vesting conditions 50 of such shares vested when the company’s total enterprise value as defined in the applicable restricted stock award agreement “tev” reached 14 billion on december 1 2014 and 50 of such shares vested when the company’s tev reached 18 billion on march 2 2015 with respect to shares of 2015 restricted stock subject to marketbased vesting conditions “2015 marketbased ltip stock” 50 of such shares vested when the company’s tev reached 265 billion on august 1 2016 and the remaining 50 will vest if the company’s tev equals or exceeds 35 billion the tev threshold for shares of 2016 restricted stock subject to marketbased vesting conditions “2016 marketbased ltip stock” varies depending on the grant date all shares of 2016 marketbased ltip stock granted on april 15 2016 vested when the company’s tev reached 265 billion on july 28 2016 due to differences in the number of shares outstanding at the respective grant dates which affected the tev calculation there was a two trading day gap between the vesting of shares of 2016 marketbased ltip stock and shares of 2015 marketbased ltip stock at the 265 billion tev threshold the remaining shares of 2016 marketbased ltip stock are subject to tev vesting thresholds of 39 billion and 42 billion 

the following table shows the shares of 2015 marketbased ltip stock and 2016 marketbased ltip stock outstanding as of december 31 2016 and the tev vesting thresholds with respect to such shares

 



 

 

recent accounting pronouncements   

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” this authoritative guidance includes a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services the fasb has since issued several additional amendments to this guidance in april 2015 the fasb proposed a one year deferral of the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard for public and nonpublic entities reporting under us gaap and on july 9 2015 the fasb approved the one year deferral the effective date of the amended standard will begin in periods beginning after december 15 2017 and early adoption is permitted but no earlier than for reporting periods beginning after december 31 2016 the company has an ongoing project to assess the impact of the standard that has been conducted with the assistance of an international accounting firm the company has not fully determined the impact of the new revenue recognition standard on its systems processes and consolidated financial statements however we expect the new standard will have a material impact on the manner in which we account for certain costs to acquire new contracts ie selling and commission costs and costs to fulfill contracts ie costs related to implementation services performed generally as it relates to these types of costs the provisions of the new standard will result in the deferral of these costs on the consolidated balance sheets and subsequently the amortizing of these costs to the consolidated statements of income over the expected life of our client relationships which we have determined to be an average of 10 years the company is still evaluating whether implementation services contain an implied performance obligation in the form of a material right to the customer and if so what impact that would have on the recognition of implementation revenues we expect to complete our assessment process including selecting a transition method for adoption by the end of the third quarter of 2017 and will complete our implementation process prior to the adoption of this asu on january 1 2018

 

 

in july 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201511 “inventory topic 330 simplifying the measurement of inventory” under the new guidance an entity should measure inventory as defined within the scope of the guidance at the lower of cost or net realizable value the new guidance applies to all inventory except inventory measured using la stin firstout lifo or the retail inventory method net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predicable costs of completion disposal and transportation the new guidance is ef fective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within those fiscal years accordingly the standard is effective for us on january 1 2017 we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standar d will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201601 “financial instruments – overall subtopic 82510 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities” the amendments in this guidance require all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee the amendments in this guidance also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrumentspecific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments in addition the amendments in this guidance eliminate the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet for public business entities the new guidance is effective for us for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 and early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 “leases topic 842” the purpose of the guidance is to increase the transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet as well as providing additional disclosure requirements related to leasing arrangements the new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2018 though early adoption is permitted full retrospective application is prohibited we anticipate that the adoption of this accounting standard will materially affect our consolidated balance sheets and may require changes to the system and processes that we use to account for leases we have not yet made any decision on the timing of adoption or method of adoption with respect to the optional practical expedients

nongaap financial measures

management uses adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income as supplemental measures to review and assess the performance of our core business operations and for planning purposes we define i adjusted ebitda as net income plus interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization noncash stockbased compensation expense net loss on early repayment of debt and certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations and ii nongaap net income as net income plus noncash stockbased compensation expense net loss on early repayment of debt and certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations each of which is adjusted for the effect of income taxes adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income are metrics that provide investors with greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking we believe these metrics are useful to investors because they facilitate comparisons of our core business operations across periods on a consistent basis as well as comparisons with the results of peer companies many of which use similar nongaap financial measures to supplement results under us gaap in addition adjusted ebitda is a measure that provides useful information to management about the amount of cash available for reinvestment in our business repurchasing common stock and other purposes management believes that the nongaap measures presented in this form 10k when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with us gaap provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business and performance

adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income are not measures of financial performance under us gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income which we consider to be the most directly comparable us gaap measure adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing our operating performance you should not consider adjusted ebitda or nongaap net income in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other consolidated statements of income data prepared in accordance with us gaap adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income may not be comparable to similar titled measures of other companies and other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do

 

 

the following tables reconcile net income to adjusted ebitda net income to nongaap net income and earnings pe r share to nongaap net income per share on a basic and diluted basis 

 

 



 



 



 

 

 



 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate sensitivity

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 602 million as of december 31 2016 we consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less and money market funds to be cash equivalents these amounts are invested primarily in demand deposit accounts money market funds and certificates of deposit we also invest funds held for clients in money market funds demand deposit accounts commercial paper and certificates of deposit the primary objectives of our investing activities are capital preservation meeting our liquidity needs and with respect to investing client funds generating interest income while maintaining the safety of principal we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes

our investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates the market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates

we do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition with respect to our cash equivalents

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure we believe however that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error within a company if any have been detected 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2016 the end of the period covered by this form 10k based upon such evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date

board of directors and stockholders

paycom software inc

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of paycom software inc a delaware corporation and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 31 2016 based on criteria established in the 2013 internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 based on criteria established in the 2013 internal control—integrated framework issued by coso

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements of the company as of and for the year ended december 31 2016 and our report dated february 21 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

overview

we are a leading provider of a comprehensive cloudbased hcm software solution delivered as saas we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions including talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and human resources “hr” management applications our userfriendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees enabling selfmanagement of their hcm activities in the cloud which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity

organizations need sophisticated flexible and intuitive applications that can quickly adapt to their evolving hcm requirements streamline their hr processes and systems and enable them to control costs we believe that the hcm needs of most organizations are currently served either by multiple providers that partner in an attempt to replicate a comprehensive product or by legacy providers offering outdated onpremise products these approaches often result in challenges with system integration low scalability high costs extended delivery times and large upfront capital requirements

 

because our solution was developed inhouse and is based on a single platform there is no need to integrate update or access multiple databases which are common issues with competitor offerings that use multiple thirdparty system s in order to link together their hcm offerings additionally our solution maintains data integrity for accurate actionable and realtime analytics and business intelligence and helps clients minimize the risk of compliance errors due to inaccurate or mi ssing information we deliver featurerich applications while maintaining excellence in information security and quality management standards as evidenced by our international organization for standardization “iso” certifications 

we sell our solution directly through our internally trained clientfocused and highly skilled sales force based in offices across the united states as a part of our client retention effort a specialist within a dedicated team is assigned to each client to provide industryleading personalized service we have over 15000 clients none of which constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2015 we believe that as a result of our focus on client retention we enjoy high client satisfaction as evidenced by an average annual revenue retention rate of 91 from existing clients for the three years ended december 31 2015 we believe our revenue retention rate understates our client loyalty because this rate also includes former clients that were acquired or otherwise ceased operations

we were founded in 1998 since our founding we have focused on providing an innovative saas hcm solution as of december 31 2015 we had 1461 employees across the united states for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 our revenues were 2247 million 1509 million and 1076 million respectively representing yearoveryear growth in revenues of approximately 49 and 40 respectively we currently derive the majority of our revenues from payroll processing we are able to determine revenues from payroll processing because all of our clients are required to utilize our payroll application in order to access our other applications we generally do not separately track our revenues across our other applications because we often sell applications in various groupings and configurations for a single price we realized net income of 209 million 57 million and 06 million for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively

industry background

large market opportunity for hcm technologies

according to the international data corporation “idc” the us market for hcm applications is comprised of software that automates business processes covering the entire span of an employee’s relationship with his or her employer idc estimates that the us market for hcm applications excluding payroll services will total 78 billion in 2016 these applications include maintenance of hr records recruiting applications performance management time and labor management tracking compliance compensation management and other hr functions according to idc the us market for payroll services will be an estimated 172 billion in 2016 the payroll services market includes transactional activities associated with paying employees maintaining accounting records and administrating payroll taxes while payroll accounting applications offer the functionality to effectively track these various payments and transfers

economic and technological trends are driving demand for hcm solutions

organizations operating in today’s global economy are continually under pressure to reduce operating costs in order to maintain or improve their competitive positions one tactic used by organizations is to utilize information technology “it” provided by external resources in order to automate internal processes reduce internal administrative burdens and more effectively manage capital expenditures and labor costs as a result businesses are increasingly making the strategic decision to leverage hcm technologies in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their internal hr and accounting functions and capture opportunities for cost savings

organizations are also managing internal costs and administrative burdens by transitioning technological assets from onpremise to the cloud by shifting hr systems to the cloud businesses seek to avoid the difficulties associated with maintaining software and security updates and storage needs as well as other maintenance issues the rise of cloud computing has supported the saas delivery model according to idc the global saas market is projected to grow from 429 billion in 2014 to 902 billion in 2019 at a compound annual growth rate “cagr” of 16

we believe that businesses increasingly view data concerning their human capital as a critical strategic resource that can result in more informed decisionmaking concerning employee recruitment retention and compensation this revolution in data analytics and its extension to hr functions has increased the number of employees within an organization that can benefit from and who regularly interface with information technologies as a result organizations seek intuitive technologies that do not require extensive technological credentials to be effectively utilized the user experience of business applications is changing to emulate the consumer experience as hr buyers increasingly seek applications that are intuitive and available anywhere on any webenabled device

 

incumbent hcm products struggle to meet the needs of businesses 

we believe that a majority of businesses and organizations in the united states are using multiple hcm systems from more than one vendor thereby impeding their ability to share data across these systems several incumbent payroll and hcm vendors offer product sets that consist of separate systems that require integration in certain cases this disparate product offering across several vendors is the result of several acquisitions which often leads to a loosely coupled product set that is marked by significant architectural differences and weak data integration we believe that this type of offering increases the risk of user or system error and reduces overall effectiveness

a comprehensive hcm solution leverages the same data process and workflow management security model reporting and analytics tools and user portals to provide a uniform user experience we believe that significant analytical power remains trapped within the data that organizations are accessing across multiple applications and databases but are unable to analyze in a unified context

we believe that vendors who pursue market segmentation strategies based on organization size or industry create difficulties for clients who grow either in size or industry scope beyond the confines of those vendors’ offerings a scalable hcm solution based on a core system of record allows for an organization to grow in size and scope without transitioning to a new user interface or backend database

the paycom solution

scalability to grow with our clients

our solution is highly scalable we serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one to approximately 8000 employees we calculate the number of clients’ employees based on parent company grouping our clients are able to use the same solution while their businesses grow by deploying applications asneeded in realtime pricing is determined by employee headcount and the number of applications utilized enabling our clients to align hcm spending with their evolving hcm needs as compared to traditional hcm products that require clients to migrate to new software as they grow but retain fixed costs even if the client shrinks in size

efficient and productive research and development

we believe that we benefit from a competitive advantage with our research and development investments people and processes early investments in our proprietary cloudbased architecture enable us to develop and deploy applications in a timely and costeffective manner we have also chosen to base our research and development team in oklahoma and texas which we believe provides us with highquality talent at a lower cost compared to other locations in the united states with a need for technology talent these strategic decisions have enabled us to have a highly productive research and development function while our research and development expenses grew 99 102 and 31 from the comparable year period for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively

our strategy for growth

our strategy is to continue to establish our solution as the hcm industry standard to accomplish this we intend to

increase our presence in existing markets

although we have clients in all 50 states we believe a significant opportunity exists to expand our presence within markets where we currently have a sales office we have a sales office in 32 of the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas “msas” in the united states based on july 2014 us census bureau estimates five of which are served by multiple sales teams we believe that the 50 largest msas in the united states could collectively support at least 90 additional sales teams each sales office is typically staffed with one sales team with each team comprised of a sales manager and approximately six to nine other sales professionals we plan to increase our presence in existing markets by adding sales offices and increasing the number of our sales teams to further penetrate and effectively capture these markets

 

expand into additional markets 

we plan to continue expanding our sales capability by opening sales offices in certain metropolitan areas where we currently have no sales teams since september 2012 we have opened new sales offices in baltimore brooklyn chicago cincinnati cleveland detroit indianapolis kansas city minneapolis nashville new york pasadena philadelphia pittsburgh portland sacramento san antonio san francisco san jose seattle and stamford we intend to open 10 to 14 additional sales offices over the next two years as well as potentially expand over the longer term into international markets

we have historically selected new locations based on potential client and employee demographics as well as business density our property management team handles the nonpersonnel aspects of new office openings from securing an office lease through establishing information security infrastructure and procedures for the prospective office location when opening a new sales office we typically relocate a proven sales manager from an existing territory who then recruits a team of high performing sales representatives it typically takes a new sales office 24 months to reach maturity 

enlarge our existing client relationships

we dedicate our resources to helping our clients facilitate their goals whether through helping them execute better hiring decisions manage compensation more effectively or simply operate more efficiently we believe a significant growth opportunity exists in selling additional applications to our current clients many clients have subsequently deployed additional applications as they recognize the benefits of our comprehensive solution as we extend and enhance the functionality of our solution we will continue to invest in initiatives to increase the adoption of our solution and maintain our high levels of client satisfaction

target larger clients

the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations and increased the number of applications we offer based on our total revenues we have grown at an approximately 41 cagr from january 1 2011 through december 31 2015 our solution requires no adjustment to serve larger clients we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients and to increase our revenue per client with limited incremental cost to us to further capitalize on this opportunity we intend to target larger businesses opportunistically where our current sales model is effective

maintain our leadership in innovation by strengthening and extending our solution

our ability to develop and deploy new applications and updates rapidly and costeffectively has been integral to the results that we have achieved to date we intend to continue extending the functionality and range of our solution in the future our development efforts are performed exclusively inhouse and are heavily based upon proactive research and client input in the nearterm we intend to focus our investments on further developing applications within our higher margin hr and talent management applications over the long term we intend to increase our investment in the development of new applications that are responsive to the needs of our clients which are garnered through ongoing client interaction and collaboration

our applications

our hcm solution offers a full suite of applications that generally fall within the following categories talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management

talent acquisition

 



 



time and labor management

 



 

payroll 

 



talent management

 



 

hr management 

 



our clients

we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry we have over 15000 clients or approximately 9000 clients based on parent company grouping none of which constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2015 we stored data for more than 21 million persons employed by our clients during the year ended december 31 2015

many of our clients that are small to midsized companies can typically make the decision to adopt our solution more quickly than larger companies which we believe results in a shorter sales cycle and more closely corresponds to our target sales cycle of 30 to 90 days as a result of the nature and size of our clientele we maintain a diversified client base and very low revenue concentration among our clients we believe however that larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients and to increase our revenue per client with limited incremental cost as we attract clients at the higher end of our target client size range we may face longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales

competition

the market for hcm solutions is rapidly evolving highly competitive and subject to changing technology shifting client needs and frequent introduction of new products and services our competitors range from small regional firms to large wellestablished international firms with multiple product offerings

 

we compete with firms that provide hcm solutions by various means many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software but as demand for greater flexibility and a ccess to information grows we believe there will be increased competition in the delivery of hcm cloudbased solutions by other saas providers our competitors offer hcm solutions that may overlap with one several or all categories of applications offere d by our solution our talent acquisition and talent management applications compete primarily with cornerstone ondemand inc oracle corporation sap se and workday inc our payroll applications including payroll processing compete primarily with auto matic data processing inc “adp” ceridian hcm  inc “ceridian”  concur technologies inc intuit inc paychex inc paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc our hr management applications compete primarily with adp ceri dian oracle corporation paychex inc paylocity holding corporation sap se  and workday inc our time and labor management applications compete primarily with adp ceridian paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc our large r competitors compete with us across multiple segments in addition our hcm solution continues to face competition from inhouse payroll and hr systems and departments as well as hr systems and software sold by thirdparty vendors 

competition in the hcm solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation breadth of service and application offering and price the importance of these factors depends on the size of the business price tends to be the most important factor of competition for smaller businesses with fewer employees while the scope of features and customization is more important to larger businesses we believe that our saas delivery model allows us to be most competitive in the hcm solutions market across this spectrum

sales and marketing

we sell our solution exclusively through our captive sales force substantially all of whom have a fouryear college degree we typically recruit sales candidates who have sales experience in nonhcm industries or with respect to candidates recruited directly from colleges and universities who have demonstrated an aptitude for sales our sales force is comprised of inside sales and field sales personnel who are organized geographically and client relations representatives “crrs” who sell additional applications to existing clients we have 42 sales teams located in 24 states and plan to open additional sales offices to further expand our presence in the us market

we provide our sales force with an intensive fourweek training course that includes at least one week of training at our headquarters in oklahoma city our unique training program includes instruction in accounting business metrics application features and tax matters relevant to our target market and we believe it fosters loyalty and helps maintain our corporate culture our training continues for our sales force through weekly inoffice strategy sessions and leadership development training executive sales representatives are also required to attend inperson quarterly conferences to share best practices and receive legal and business updates

when a new client processes with us for an entire month our sales representative receives a commission based upon annualized new recurring revenues this commission is only paid once per new customer executive sales representatives receive a higher commission rate and base salary based upon both current year and lifetodate realized sales respectively

we generate client leads accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs that target senior finance and hr executives technology professionals and senior business leaders of companies that perform hcm functions inhouse or outsource these functions to one of our competitors our marketing programs include







our crrs are focused on expanding the number of applications our clients purchase from us by introducing them to additional applications our crrs call upon select clients periodically and are paid a nonrecurring commission on any additional sales they generate

technology operations and security

technology

our multitenant architecture enables us to deliver our solution across our client base with a single instance of our solution while securely partitioning access to our clients’ respective application data because a single version of our solution is developed 

 

supported and deployed across all of our clients updates are delivered to all of our clients at the same time making it easier to scale our solution as the number of our clients and their employee headcount increases 

we maintain diverse loadbalanced internet lines serviced by multiple networks to provide our clients continuous access to our solution and their stored data we back up our client data at regular intervals utilizing live replication snapshots and cold archive methods of backup and manually monitor backup success and failure regularly our server cluster and database servers have redundant “hot swappable” disks to ensure continuous service in the event of a disk failure

operations

we physically host our solution for our clients in two secure data center facilities located in oklahoma and texas all of our critical systems are fully redundant and backedup in realtime to these facilities physical security includes idoriented access control alarm systems and manned 24 hour a day camera monitoring by our security guards server facilities also have environmental monitoring and extensive environmental controls such as heat and fire protection moisture temperature and humidity sensors backup power supply and exterior reinforced concrete walls

security

we maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of our clients’ data during the regular course of business we receive client data through our online system that we in turn process record and store following isoiec 2700012013 certified controls and procedures all communications with our servers that might contain sensitive information are encrypted before they leave the network and our servers are configured to only allow highgrade encryption algorithms

we strictly regulate and limit all access to servers and networks at each of our facilities local network access is restricted by our authenticated server using access control lists and remote network access is restricted by a firewall which provides no accessible route from external networks to systems within our local network we also employ network and host intrusion detection and prevention sensors throughout our infrastructure systems that monitor and alert on insecure installations of thirdparty applications a full system for managing and installing patches for those applications and highly restricted access to the internet for anyone who has access to client data our information security department regularly performs penetration testing and we retain a thirdparty penetration testing company to conduct penetration tests and periodic audits to identify and remediate any issues

our applications are secured using multiple libraries and secure coding practices our it infrastructure is secured and monitored using a number of best practices and tools at multiple layers of the physical and logical network this security is also continually monitored by our information security department all of our operations employees work in either our oklahoma or texas locations and are not permitted to work remotely

software development

our application development team works closely with our clients to improve and enhance our application offerings and develop new applications our application development process consists of a focused innovation and development timeframe in order to deliver welldeveloped applications and enhancements desired by our clients a key element of our development process is the oneonone personal interaction between clients and our crrs through which our clients suggest new applications and features

we develop our solution from the “ground up” with our internal development and engineering teams our development and engineering teams and our employees conceive of new applications and enhancements review requests schedule development in order of priority and subsequently develop the applications or enhancements our new applications and enhancements are independently reviewed by the quality assurance team in accordance with our software development process before being fully implemented any enhancements to our applications are released on a monthly scheduled release date to coordinate the communication and release to our clients

capitalized development expenses which include compensation for employees directly associated with development projects were 43 million 22 million and 12 million for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively

client service

we are committed to providing industryleading clientcentered service for this reason we assign each client a specialist within a dedicated team this oneonone service is a key part of our client service model and helps to ensure that we are delivering an 

 

industryleading sol ution and maintaining high client satisfaction the primary elements of our client service model include the following 

streamlined setup and onboarding

after a client elects to deploy our solution that client goes through our onboarding process with assistance from a team of new client setup specialists and the sales professional responsible for obtaining the client’s business this team works closely with the client until the client is capable of managing our solution independently at which time it is transferred to our dedicated services specialists

dedicated service specialists

after completing the onboarding process each client is assigned to a services specialist within a dedicated team clients can then contact their dedicated services specialist or a team member if any issues or questions arise these specialists provide personalized service with actual knowledge of the clients’ business needs when appropriate client questions can be elevated to the specialists with the appropriate application regulatory or tax expertise in addition our crrs proactively contact our clients to ensure satisfaction with our solution and introduce additional applications

expert level service

our client specialists are trained across all of our applications to ensure that they can provide comprehensive expertlevel service our client service is iso 90012008 certified and helps support a high client retention rate

regulatory and certifications

we are subject to varying degrees of regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide services local laws and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement differ significantly among those jurisdictions these regulations and laws cover among others information disclosure

personal privacy has become a significant issue in the united states and in other countries the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future many federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations affecting or regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information in the united states these include for example rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca and state breach notification laws

we voluntarily obtain third party security examinations relating to security and data privacy in accordance with statement on standards for attestation engagements “ssae” no 16 reporting on controls at a service organization our ssae examination is conducted every six months by an independent third party auditor and addresses among other areas our physical and environmental safeguards for production data centers data availability and integrity procedures change management procedures and logical security procedures

in january 2014 we renewed a certification based on isoiec 270012013 criteria a security standard for information security management systems published by iso covering our production quality assurance and implementation environments this independent assessment of our conformity to the iso 27001 standard includes assessing security risks designing and implementing comprehensive security controls and adopting an information security management process to meet security needs on an ongoing basis the certification is valid until february 2017 with continuing assessments taking place annually

in march 2014 we renewed a certification based on isoiec 90012008 criteria a standard for the implementation of quality management processes published by iso covering our activities required to create and deliver our solution this independent assessment of our conformity to the iso 9001 standard includes assessing the design and implementation of quality objectives to meet delivery standards on an ongoing basis the certification is valid until april 2017 with continuing assessments taking place annually

intellectual property

we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights we also have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we do not have any patents or patent applications pending

 

seasonality 

our revenues are seasonal in nature recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs such as bonuses for our clients because payroll forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year first quarter revenue and margins are generally higher than in subsequent quarters we anticipate that commencing in 2016 first quarter revenues will also exhibit a stronger seasonal pattern as a result of the enactment of the aca which requires clients to file forms 1094 and 1095 in the first quarter in addition we often experience increased revenue during the fourth quarter due to unscheduled payroll runs for our clients that occur before the end of the year we believe this seasonality is driven by several factors most notably the number of our clients that use our payroll application as compared to the other applications that we offer 

employees

our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees is critical to our continued success we invest heavily in our training and leadership development programs to encourage the development and promotion of our employees as of december 31 2015 we employed 1461 people none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

facilities

our corporate headquarters is located in oklahoma city oklahoma on a 170000 square foot corporate campus that includes a disaster recovery site located in oklahoma city we own over 30 acres in oklahoma city upon which our facilities are located we also operate fully redundant data centers located at our corporate headquarters in oklahoma and at an 18727 square foot operations center that we lease in dallas texas

we also lease offices in arizona california colorado connecticut florida georgia illinois indiana maryland massachusetts michigan minnesota missouri new jersey new york north carolina ohio oklahoma oregon pennsylvania tennessee texas virginia and washington we believe that these facilities are suitable for our current operations and upon the expiration of the terms of the leases we believe we could renew these leases or find suitable space elsewhere on acceptable terms

segment information

we operate in a single operating segment and a single reporting segment operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker function which is fulfilled by our chief executive officer in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance our chief executive officer allocates resources and assesses performance based upon financial information at the consolidated level since we operate in one operating segment all required financial segment information is presented in the consolidated financial statements

tableend

the risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this annual report on form 10k including those risks identified in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” describe examples of risks uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statement if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect actual outcomes may vary materially from those included in this annual report on form 10k

risks related to our business and industry

our business depends substantially on our clients’ continued use of our applications their purchases of additional applications from us and our ability to add new clients any decline in our clients’ continued use of our applications or purchases of additional applications could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

in order for us to maintain or improve our operating results it is important that our current clients continue to use our applications and purchase additional applications from us and that we add new clients our clients have no obligation to continue to use our applications and may choose not to continue to use our applications at the same or higher level of service if at all in the past some of our clients have elected not to continue to use our applications moreover our clients generally have the right to cancel their agreements with us for any or no reason by providing 30 days’ prior written notice

our client retention rates may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the level of client satisfaction with our applications pricing the prices of competing products or services mergers and acquisitions affecting our client base reduced hiring by our clients or reductions in our clients’ spending levels if our clients do not continue to use our applications renew on less favorable terms or fail to purchase additional applications or if we fail to add new clients our revenues may decline and our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected

the market in which we participate is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected

the market for hcm software is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented we expect competition to intensify in the future with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants many of our current and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition longer operating histories more established relationships in the industry and significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as a result some of these competitors may be able to















some of our principal competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures similarly some competitors offer different billing terms which has resulted in pressures on our billing terms if we are unable to maintain our pricing levels and our billing terms our operating results would be negatively impacted in addition pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales reduced margins losses or the failure of our solution to maintain widespread market acceptance any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

we compete with firms that provide hcm solutions by various means many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software but as demand for greater flexibility and access to information grows we believe there will be increased competition in the delivery of hcm cloudbased solutions by other saas providers our competitors offer hcm solutions that overlap with one several or all categories of applications that we offer our talent acquisition and talent management applications compete primarily with cornerstone ondemand inc oracle corporation sap se and workday inc our payroll applications including payroll processing compete primarily with adp ceridian concur technologies inc intuit inc paychex inc paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc our hr management applications compete primarily with adp ceridian oracle corporation 

 

paychex inc paylocity holding corporation sap se  and workday inc our time and labor management applications compete primari ly with adp ceridian paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc most of our larger competitors compete with us across multiple application categories in addition our hcm solution continues to face competition from inhouse payr oll and hr systems and departments as well as hr systems and software sold by thirdparty vendors 

competition in the hcm solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness application quality and reputation breadth of service and product offering and price many of our competitors have established marketing relationships access to larger client bases and major distribution agreements with consultants software vendors and distributors in addition some competitors may offer software that addresses one or a limited number of hcm functions at a lower price point or with greater depth than our solution further some potential clients particularly large enterprises may elect to develop their own internal solutions if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected

we have historically derived a majority of our revenues from payroll processing and our efforts to increase the use of our other hcm applications may not be successful and may reduce our revenue growth rate

to date we have derived a majority of our revenues from payroll processing compared to payroll processing our participation in other hcm applications markets is relatively new and it is uncertain whether our revenue from other hcm applications will continue to grow the relatively limited extent to which our other hcm applications have been adopted by our clients and the uncertainty regarding the adoption of any new applications beyond our existing applications may make it difficult to evaluate our business because the potential market for such applications remains uncertain our hcm solution may not achieve and sustain the high level of market acceptance that is critical for the success of our business the failure to increase the use of our hcm applications and any new applications developed by us may reduce our revenue growth rate which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

if our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to our clients’ or their employees’ sensitive data is otherwise obtained our solution may not be perceived as being secure clients may reduce the use of or stop using our solution our ability to attract new clients may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities

our solution involves the collection storage and transmission of clients’ and their employees’ confidential and proprietary information including personal or identifying information as well as financial and payroll data hcm software is increasingly being targeted in cyberattacks including computer viruses worms phishing attacks malicious software programs and other information security breaches which could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our clients’ sensitive data or otherwise disrupt our clients’ or other third parties’ business operations if cybercriminals are able to circumvent our security measures or if we are unable to detect an intrusion into our systems and contain such intrusion in a reasonable amount of time our clients’ sensitive data may be compromised

certain of our employees have access to sensitive information about our clients’ employees while we conduct background checks of our employees and limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls resulting in a security breach 

although we have security measures in place to protect client information and prevent data loss and other security breaches these measures could be breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently we may not be able to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative or protective measures while we currently maintain a cyber liability insurance policy cyber liability insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our cyber liability insurance policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention

any actual or perceived breach of our security could damage our reputation cause existing clients to discontinue the use of our solution prevent us from attracting new clients or subject us to thirdparty lawsuits regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

if the saas market develops more slowly than we expect or declines our growth may slow or stall and our business could be adversely affected

the saas market is not as mature as the market for on premise enterprise software and it is uncertain whether saas will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance our success depends not only on strong demand for hcm services in general but also to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of saas many companies have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to 

 

migrate to saas it is difficult to predict client adoption rates and demand for our solution the future growth rate and size of the saas market or the entry of competitive products the expansion of the saas market depends on a number of factors including the cost performance and perceived value associated with saas as well as the ability of saas providers to address security and privacy concerns if other saas providers experience security inc idents loss of client data disruptions in delivery or other problems the market for saas applications as a whole including our solution may be negatively affected if there is a reduction in demand for saas caused by a lack of client acceptance techn ological challenges weakening economic conditions security or privacy concerns competing technologies and products decreases in corporate spending or otherwise our growth may slow or stall and our business could be adversely affected 

any interruption or failure of our data centers could impair our ability to effectively provide our solution and adversely affect our business

we serve all of our clients from our two data centers located in oklahoma and texas these locations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from severe weather tornados terrorist attacks earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses or cyberattacks they are also subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct our solution depends on the continuing operation of our data centers and any damage to or failure of our data centers could result in interruptions in our services any interruption in our service including adverse changes in service levels at our data centers could damage our reputation and consequently our ability to attract new clients cause our clients to terminate their use of our solution and prevent us from gaining new or additional business from current clients which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition

any significant disruption in our saas network infrastructure could harm our reputation and expose us to significant costs

our saas network infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations our clients access our solution through standard web browsers smart phones tablets and other webenabled devices and depend on us for fast and reliable access to our solution in the future we may experience disruptions in our computing and communications infrastructure factors that may cause such disruptions include

















if our saas network infrastructure or our clients’ ability to access our solution is interrupted client and employee data from recent transactions may be permanently lost and we could be exposed to significant claims by clients particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds due to employees any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to retain clients and sell our solution which would adversely impact our revenues

we have also experienced significant growth in the number of clients and transactions and the amount of client and employee data that our network infrastructure supports we seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our network infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our clients and their employees and to facilitate the rapid provision of new client deployments and the expansion of existing client deployments any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our network infrastructure could adversely affect our reputation and may result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our solution any interruptions in the availability of our solution might reduce our revenues cause us to issue refunds to clients or adversely affect our retention of existing clients which could have a negative impact on our business or financial condition

 

if our solution fails to perform properly our reputation could be adversely affected and our market share could decline 

our solution is inherently complex and may in the future contain or develop undetected defects or errors any defects in our applications could adversely affect our reputation impair our ability to sell our applications in the future and result in significant costs to us the costs incurred in correcting any application defects may be substantial and could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition any defects in functionality or that cause interruptions in the availability of our applications could result in













because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our clients regard as significant our clients might assert claims against us in the future alleging that they suffered damages due to a defect error or other failure of our solution our errors and omissions insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention any failures in the performance of our solution could harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients which would have an adverse impact on our business operating results or financial condition

if we do not effectively expand and train our sales force and our support teams we may be unable to add new clients and retain existing clients

we need to continue to expand our sales force and support team members in order to grow our client base and increase our revenues to continue to execute our growth strategy we must also attract and retain qualified sales marketing and operational personnel capable of supporting a larger and more diverse client base identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use of our applications requires significant time expense and attention and it can take a substantial amount of time before our sales representatives and support team members are fullytrained and productive we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we currently or intend in the future to do business and our recent hires and planned hires may not achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time or become as productive as we expect if our expansion efforts are unsuccessful or do not generate a corresponding increase in revenues our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected

if we are not able to develop enhancements and new applications keep pace with technological developments or respond to future disruptive technologies we might not remain competitive and our business could be adversely affected

our future success will depend on our ability to adapt and innovate to attract new clients and increase revenues from existing clients we need to enhance add new features to and improve our existing applications and introduce new applications the success of any enhancements or new features and applications depends on several factors including timely completion introduction and market acceptance we may expend significant time and resources developing and pursuing sales of a particular enhancement or application that may not result in revenues in the anticipated time frame or at all or may not result in revenue growth sufficient to offset increased expenses if we are unable to successfully develop enhancements new features or new applications to meet client needs our business and operating results could be adversely affected

in addition because our applications are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using internet tools and protocols we will need to continuously modify and enhance our applications to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies if we are unable to respond in a timely and costeffective manner to these rapid technological developments our current and future applications may become less marketable and less competitive or even obsolete

our success is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver hcm solutions at lower prices more efficiently or more conveniently such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete

 

the market for our solution among large companies may be limited if these companies demand customized features and functions that we do not offer 

prospective clients especially larger companies may require customized features and functions unique to their business processes that we do not offer in order to ensure we meet these requirements we may devote a significant amount of support and services resources to larger prospective clients increasing the cost and time required to complete sales with no guarantee that these prospective clients will adopt our solution further we may not be successful in implementing any customized features or functions if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we do not offer or that would be difficult for them to deploy themselves the market for our solution will be more limited and our business could be adversely affected

our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth and organizational change if we fail to manage such growth and change effectively we may be unable to execute our business plan maintain high levels of service or adequately address competitive challenges

we have experienced and may continue to experience rapid growth in our headcount and operations which has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management operational and financial resources for example our headcount has grown from 523 employees as of december 31 2011 to 1461 employees as of december 31 2015 and we have expanded from 20 sales teams as of december 31 2011 to 42 sales teams as of january 31 2016 we have also experienced significant growth in the number of clients and transactions and the amount of client and employee data that our infrastructure supports finally our organizational structure and recording systems and procedures are becoming more complex as we improve our operational financial and management controls our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth and organizational change effectively to manage the expected growth of our headcount and operations we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures our ability to add additional offices may be constrained by the willingness and availability of qualified personnel to help staff and manage any new offices the failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulties or delays in obtaining clients selling additional applications to our clients declines in quality or client satisfaction of our applications increases in costs and difficulties in introducing new applications or other operational difficulties any of which could adversely affect our business by impairing our ability to retain and attract clients or sell additional applications to our existing clients

we may encounter long sales cycles with larger prospective clients which could adversely affect our operating results in a given period

we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients we serve and to increase our revenue per client to further capitalize on this opportunity we intend to pursue larger businesses opportunistically within our target client size range where our current sales model is effective as we target our sales efforts at larger clients we will face longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales in the large enterprise market the clients’ decision to use our applications may be an enterprisewide decision and therefore these types of sales will require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our applications in addition our target clients may prefer to purchase applications that are critical to their business from one of our larger more established competitors our typical sales cycles are 30 to 90 days and we expect that this sales cycle may continue or increase as we pursue larger clients longer sales cycles could cause our operating and financial results to suffer in a given period

our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our deployment or technical support services

our business depends on our ability to satisfy our clients both with respect to our applications and the technical support provided to help clients use the applications that address the needs of their businesses we use our inhouse deployment personnel to implement and configure our solution and provide support to our clients if a client is not satisfied with the quality of our solution or the applications delivered or the support provided we could incur additional costs to address the situation our profitability might be negatively affected and the client’s dissatisfaction with our deployment service could damage our ability to sell additional applications to that client in addition our sales process is highly dependent on the reputation of our solution and applications and on positive recommendations from our existing clients any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality technical support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell our applications to existing and prospective clients and as a result our business operating results or financial condition

 

if we fail to retain key employees and recruit qualifi ed personnel our business could be adversely affected 

we believe that our success depends on the continued services of our senior management and other key employees including chad richison craig e boelte jeffrey d york william x kerber iii and stacey pezold in addition because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new applications we are heavily dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified software developers and it personnel with the requisite education background and industry experience the loss of the services of a significant number of our developers could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships in addition if any of our key employees joins a competitor or decides to otherwise compete with us we may experience a material disruption of our operations and development plans which may adversely affect our business by causing us to lose clients increase operating expenses or divert management’s attention to recruit replacements for the departed key employees

our financial results may fluctuate due to many factors some of which may be beyond our control

our results of operations including the levels of our revenues costs of revenues administrative expenses operating income cash flow and deferred revenue may vary significantly in the future and the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance fluctuations in our financial results may negatively impact the value of our common stock our financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control and as a result may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate from period to period include without limitation

































certain of our operating results and financial metrics are difficult to predict as a result of seasonality

we have historically experienced seasonality in our revenues because a significant portion of our recurring revenues relate to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 because these forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year first quarter revenues are generally higher than subsequent quarters we also anticipate that acarelated filings which will generally be due in the first quarter of the year will amplify the seasonal nature of our revenues we expect this seasonality to continue in the future which may cause fluctuations in certain of our operating results and financial metrics and thus make such results and metrics difficult to predict

 

if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights our competitive advantage could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets generate reduced revenue or incur costly litigation to protect our rights  

our success is dependent in part upon our intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and to protect our intellectual property rights however the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our applications and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products or services that compete with ours

we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property we have been involved in litigation in the past and litigation may be necessary in the future to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets such litigation could be costly timeconsuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights we may not be able to secure protect and enforce our intellectual property rights or control access to and the distribution of our solution and proprietary information which could affect our business

we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights

considerable intellectual property development activity exists in our industry and we expect that software developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of applications and competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps our competitors as well as a number of other entities and individuals may own or claim to own intellectual property in technology areas relating to our solution or applications in addition we may increasingly be subject to trademark infringement claims as our presence grows in the marketplace from time to time third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights a claim of infringement may also be made relating to technology that we acquire or license from third parties however we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover or may be alleged to cover some or all of our solution applications or brands

the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable and as a result any future litigation or claim of infringement could i cause us to enter into an unfavorable royalty or license agreement pay ongoing royalties or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms ii require us to discontinue the sale of our solution or applications iii require us to indemnify our clients or thirdparty service providers or iv require us to expend additional development resources to redesign our solution or applications any of these outcomes could harm our business even if we were to prevail any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business and operations

we employ thirdparty licensed software for use in our applications and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs or reduced service levels which could adversely affect our business

our applications incorporate certain thirdparty software obtained under licenses from other companies we anticipate that we will continue to rely on such thirdparty software and development tools from third parties in the future although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the thirdparty software we currently license this may not always be the case or it may be difficult or costly to replace in addition integration of the software used in our applications with new thirdparty software may require significant work and substantial investment of our time and resources also to the extent that our applications depend upon the successful operation of thirdparty software in conjunction with our software any undetected errors or defects in this thirdparty software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our applications delay new application introductions result in a failure of our applications and harm our reputation

the use of open source software in our applications may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property rights

some of our applications use software covered by open source licenses from time to time there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate such software into their products or applications as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software litigation could be costly for us to defend have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional development resources to change our applications in addition if we were to combine our applications with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain of the open source licenses be required to release the source code of our applications if we inappropriately use open source software we may be required to redesign our applications discontinue the sale of our applications or take other remedial actions which could adversely impact our business operating results or financial condition

 

we may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development activities for several years if at all 

developing saasbased applications is expensive and the investment in the development of these applications often involves a long return on our investment cycle we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development activities accelerated application introductions and short software life cycles require increased levels of research and development expenditures that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by increased revenues we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development activities to maintain our competitive position we may not receive significant revenues from these investments however for several years if at all

the failure to develop our brand costeffectively could have an adverse effect on our business

we believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a costeffective manner is critical to achieving the widespread acceptance of our solution and is an important element in attracting new clients and retaining existing clients successful promotion of our brand depends largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful applications at competitive prices brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues and even if they do any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brand if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand we may fail to attract enough new clients or retain our existing clients to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding efforts which could have an adverse effect on our business

we might require additional capital to support business growth and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms if at all

we have funded our operations since inception through cash flows generated from operations cash from the sale of debt and equity securities and borrowings under consolidated loans in the future we may require additional capital to support our growth and respond to operational challenges including the need to develop new features and applications or enhance our existing applications improve our infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies accordingly we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds if we raise additional funds through issuances of equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock any debt financing we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities including potential acquisitions in addition we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it our ability to continue to support our growth and respond to challenges could be significantly limited

our outstanding indebtedness is subject to certain operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities and may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business

as of december 31 2015 we had a term note under the 2021 consolidated loan with an outstanding principal amount of 259 million due to kirkpatrick bank that matures on may 30 2021 the “2021 consolidated loan” the 2021 consolidated loan is secured by a mortgage covering our headquarters buildings and certain personal property relating to our headquarters buildings on may 13 2015 we entered into an additional loan agreement the “construction loan” with kirkpatrick bank to finance the expansion of our corporate headquarters as of december 31 2015 we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the construction loan pursuant to the terms of the 2021 consolidated loan we may not subject to certain exceptions until amounts under the 2021 consolidated loan are repaid



















 

to the extent we borrow under the construction loan the foregoing covenants will also apply until all such amounts are repaid in addition under the 2021 consolidated loan and the construction loan together the “loan agreements” we are required to ma intain a fixed charge coverage ratio of e arnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ ebitda ” to fixed charges defined as current maturities of longterm debt interest expense  rent expense and distributions of greater than 1 2 to 1 0  which is measured on a quarterly basis  the operating and financial covenants in the loan agreements as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into may restrict our ability to finance our operations engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies we may also be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on our debt which would reduce the amount of money we have for operations working capital expansion or other general corporate purposes 

our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations and comply with the operating and financial covenants may be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to control many of these factors and comply with these covenants a breach of any of the covenants under the loan agreements could result in an event of default which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under the loan agreements to become immediately due and payable

we may acquire other businesses applications or technologies which could divert our management’s attention result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results

in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses applications or technologies that we believe complement or expand our applications enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities the pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur expenses in identifying investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions whether or not they are ultimately consummated

we do not have any experience in acquiring other businesses if we acquire additional businesses we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel operations and technologies successfully or to effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition we also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors including























in addition a significant portion of the purchase price of any companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets which must be assessed for impairment at least annually in the future if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process which could harm our results of operations acquisitions could also result in issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt which would result in dilution to our stockholders

our growth depends in part on the success of our relationships with third parties

we rely on thirdparty financial and accounting processing systems as well as various financial institutions to perform financial services in connection with our applications such as providing automated clearing house “ach” and wire transfers as part of our payroll and expense reimbursement services and to provide technology and content support manufacture time clocks and process background checks we anticipate that we will continue to depend on various thirdparty relationships in order to grow our business 

 

provide technology and content support manufacture time clocks and process background checks identifying n egotiating and documenting relationships with these third parties and integrating thirdparty content and technology requires significant time and resources our agreements with third parties typically are nonexclusive and do not prohibit them from workin g with our competitors in addition these third parties may not perform as expected under our agreements and we may have disagreements or disputes with such third parties which could negatively affect our brand and reputation a global economic slowdown could also adversely affect the businesses of our third party providers particularly those financial institutions that process transactions through the ach network and it is possible that they may not be able to devote the resources we expect to our rel ationship 

if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected even if we are successful these relationships may not result in improved operating results

adverse economic conditions could affect our business operating results or financial condition

our business depends on the overall demand for hcm applications and on the economic health of our current and prospective clients if economic conditions in the united states or in global markets remain uncertain or deteriorate clients may cease their operations delay or reduce their spending on hcm and other outsourcing services or attempt to renegotiate their contracts with us this could result in reductions in sales of our applications longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition in addition hcm spending levels may not increase following any recovery

if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings

we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as of december 31 2015 we had recorded a total of 519 million of goodwill and 35 million of other intangible assets an adverse change in domestic or global market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of our critical assumptions or estimates made in connection with the impairment testing of goodwill or intangible assets could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge to our goodwill or other intangible assets any such material charges may have a negative impact our operating results

we typically pay employees and may pay taxing authorities amounts due for a payroll period before a client’s electronic funds transfers are finally settled to our account if client payments are rejected by banking institutions or otherwise fail to clear into our accounts we may require additional sources of shortterm liquidity and our operating results could be adversely affected

our payroll processing application moves significant funds from the account of a client to employees and relevant taxing authorities for larger funding amounts we require clients to transfer the funds to us via fed wire for smaller funding amounts we debit a client’s account prior to any disbursement on its behalf and due to ach banking regulations funds previously credited could be reversed under certain circumstances and time frames after our payment of amounts due to employees and taxing and other regulatory authorities there is therefore a risk that the employer’s funds will be insufficient to cover the amounts we have already paid on its behalf while such shortage and accompanying financial exposure has only occurred in very limited circumstances in the past should clients default on their payment obligations in the future we might be required to advance substantial funds to cover such obligations in such an event we may be required to seek additional sources of shortterm liquidity which may not be available on reasonable terms if at all and our operating results and our liquidity could be adversely affected and our banking relationships could be harmed

because our long term success depends in part on our ability to expand the sales of our solution to clients located outside of the united states our business will be subject to risks associated with international operations

an element of our growth strategy is to expand our operations and client base to date we have not engaged in any operations outside of the united states if we decide to expand our operations into international markets it will require significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory economic and political risks that are different from those in the united states because of our lack of experience with international operations we cannot ensure that our international expansion efforts will be successful and the impact of such expansion efforts may adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

 

risks related to legislation or regulation 

privacy concerns and laws or other domestic regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our applications

our applications require the storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential information of our clients and their employees including personal or identifying information as well as their financial and payroll data our applications are subject to various complex government laws and regulations on the federal state and local levels including those governing personal privacy which has become a significant issue in the united states the regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future many federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information in the united states these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca federal and state labor and employment laws and state data breach notification laws failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition

in addition to government regulation privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different selfregulatory standards because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws are still uncertain it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our solution any failure to comply with government regulations that apply to our applications including privacy and data protection laws could subject us to liability in addition to the possibility of fines lawsuits and other claims we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our solution which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition any inability to adequately address privacy concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws regulations and policies could result in additional cost and liability to us damage our reputation inhibit sales and adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

furthermore privacy concerns may cause our clients’ employees to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our clients and their employees to use our applications effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our applications in certain industries all of these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the ability of our clients to process handle store use and transmit demographic and personal information from their employees which could reduce demand for our applications

our solution may be adversely impacted by changes in laws government regulations and policies

many of our applications are designed to assist clients’ compliance with government regulations that continually change changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for certain of our applications and substantially decrease our revenue additional regulatory or licensing requirements could also increase our cost of doing business in addition any failure to educate and assist our clients with respect to new or revised legislation that impacts them could have an adverse effect on our reputation further any failure to modify our applications in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

for example healthcare industry reforms under the aca related state laws and the regulations adopted or to be adopted thereunder have the potential to impact substantially the way that employers provide health insurance to employees and consequently the health insurance market for our current and prospective clients many provisions of the aca require the issuance of additional guidance from the us departments of labor and health  human services the internal revenue service the “irs” and the states we are unable to determine the ultimate impact that healthcare reform will have on our hcm business and our ability to attract and retain hcm clients

congress recently passed legislation that would repeal key tax and coverage aspects of the aca which was vetoed by president obama if following the november 2016 presidential election such legislation were passed and signed into law by the newly elected president or the newly elected president or his or her administration takes action to suspend all or portions of the aca the need for our aca application may be diminished or eliminated which could have an adverse effect on our operating results

 

changes in laws and regulations related to the internet or changes in the internet infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for our applications and could have a negative impact on our business 

the future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the internet as a primary medium for commerce communication and business federal state and foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet as a commercial medium changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our applications in order to comply with these changes in addition government agencies or private organizations may impose taxes fees or other charges for accessing the internet or commerce conducted via the internet these laws or charges could limit the growth of internetrelated commerce or communications generally or result in reductions in the demand for internetbased applications such as ours

in addition the use of the internet as a means of conducting business could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of internet activity security reliability cost ease of use accessibility and quality of service the performance of the internet has been adversely affected by “viruses” “worms” and similar malicious programs and the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure if the use of the internet is adversely affected by these issues demand for our applications could suffer which could adversely affect our business

if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as amended the “sarbanesoxley act” we are required to furnish a report by management on among other things the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending december 31 2015 and in each year thereafter our auditors will also need to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting

if we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated we are in the process of designing and implementing internal control over financial reporting to comply with this obligation which process will be time consuming costly and complicated if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting if we are unable to comply with the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports we could become subject to investigations by the nyse the sec or other regulatory authorities and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected

we have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies

as a public company we have incurred since our initial public offering and expect to continue to incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements for example we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the sarbanesoxley act as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the sec and the nyse including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and changes in corporate governance practices

we expect that complying with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more timeconsuming and costly in particular we have incurred and expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act which have increased in 2016 because we are no longer an emerging growth company as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act the “jobs act” 

the costs associated with operating as a public company may decrease our net income or result in a net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our solution additionally if these requirements divert management’s attention from other business concerns they could have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition

 

as of january 1 2016 we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies no lon ger apply to us 

because the market value of our common stock held by nonaffiliates exceeded 700 million as of june 30 2015 we were deemed a large accelerated filer as of january 1 2016 and accordingly we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company as a large accelerated filer we are now subject to certain disclosure requirements that apply to other public companies but did not previously apply to us due to our status as an emerging growth company these requirements include









failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to enforcement actions by the sec which could divert management’s attention damage our reputation and adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

adverse tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our clients which could increase the costs of our solution and applications and could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

the application of federal state and local tax laws to services provided electronically is evolving new income sales use or other tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time possibly with retroactive effect and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services and applications provided over the internet these enactments could adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and ultimately could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition

each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that change over time we review these rules and regulations periodically and when we believe we are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state we may voluntarily engage state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with that state’s rules and regulations we cannot ensure that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we currently believe no such taxes are required

in addition existing tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be interpreted changed modified or applied adversely to us possibly with retroactive effect which could require us or our clients to pay additional tax amounts as well as require us or our clients to pay fines or penalties and interest for past amounts if we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our clients we could be held liable for such costs thereby adversely affecting our business operating results or financial condition

risks related to ownership of our common stock

our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance

from time to time we have released and may continue to release guidance in our earnings conference calls earnings releases or otherwise regarding our future performance which represents our estimates as of the date of release this guidance which includes forwardlooking statements has been and will be based on projections prepared by our management these projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections accordingly no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections

projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that while presented with numerical specificity are inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control projections are also based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions some of which will change the principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any third parties

guidance is necessarily speculative in nature and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will vary significantly from actual results accordingly our guidance is only an estimate of what management 

 

believes is realizable as of the date of release actual results may v ary from our guidance and the variations may be material in light of the foregoing investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock 

any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this “risk factors” section in this annual report on form 10k could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance and the differences may be adverse and material

as of september 21 2015 we ceased to be a “controlled company” as defined in the nyse listed company manual and as a result we no longer qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements if we are unable to comply with applicable corporate governance requirements we may become subject to enforcement actions by the nyse

prior to september 21 2015 the parties to the amended and restated stockholders agreement dated march 10 2014 and as previously disclosed terminated as of december 29 2015 which included wcas x wcas capital iv wcas management corporation chad richison shannon rowe william x kerber iii jeffrey d york robert j levenson the estate of richard aiello and certain of their affiliates or related entities collectively the “former stockholders agreement parties” held more than 50 of the voting power for the election of our directors accordingly we relied upon the “controlled company” exception with respect to certain nyse corporate governance requirements pursuant to this exception we were exempt from the rules that would have otherwise required that our board of directors consist of a majority of independent directors and that our compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors

following the closing of a registered secondary offering on september 21 2015 the former stockholders agreement parties no longer held more than 50 of the voting power for the election of directors and as a result we are no longer a “controlled company” as defined in the nyse listed company manual by september 21 2016 our nominating and corporate governance committee and compensation committee must consist solely of independent directors and our board of directors must consist of a majority of independent directors during this phasein period our stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that have committees of their boards of directors that consist solely of independent directors and boards of directors that consist of a majority of independent directors further if within the phasein period we are not able to recruit additional directors who qualify as independent or we are not able to otherwise comply with the nyse listing requirements we may be subject to enforcement actions by the nyse 

the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the current market price

the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future if an active trading market for our common stock is not sustained you may have difficulty selling any shares of our common stock that you purchased and the value of such shares may be materially impaired the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including





















in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies in the past stockholders have filed securities 

 

class actions following periods of market volatility if we were to become involved in securities litigation it could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our busin ess operating results or financial condition 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline

the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if no or few securities or industry analysts cover our company the trading price for our common stock would be negatively impacted if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes incorrect or unfavorable research about our business our common stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our common stock could decrease which could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline

future sales of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock

we completed four secondary offerings in 2015 which involved the registration and sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock that were not freely tradable on the nyse prior to the completion of these offerings the resulting increase in the number of shares of our common stock eligible to be traded on the nyse could depress the market price of our common stock 

we have also registered shares of common stock that we have issued and may issue under our equity plans these shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance subject in some cases to volume and other restrictions under rules 144 and 701 under the securities act if any of these additional shares are sold or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market the trading price of our common stock could decline

the issuance of additional stock in connection with acquisitions our stock incentive plans warrants or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to one hundred million shares of common stock and up to ten million shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations we may issue all of these shares that are not already outstanding without any action or approval by our stockholders we intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions in the future we may pay for such acquisitions partly or in full through the issuance of additional equity securities

any issuance of shares in connection with an acquisition the exercise of stock options or warrants the award of shares of restricted stock or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by our existing stockholders

we do not intend to pay regular dividends for the foreseeable future

we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any regular dividends in the foreseeable future consequently stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management

any provision of our certificate of incorporation bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

generally accepted accounting principles in the united states are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles a 

 

change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the annou ncement of a change

the 2014 reorganization

software and its wholly owned subsidiary payroll software merger sub llc “merger sub” were formed as delaware entities on october 31 2013 and december 23 2013 respectively in anticipation of an initial public offering and were wholly owned subsidiaries of holdings prior to december 31 2013

on january 1 2014 we consummated a reorganization pursuant to which i wcas x and wcas capital iv contributed wcas holdings and wcas cp iv blocker inc “cp iv blocker” which together owned all of the series a preferred units of holdings to software in exchange for shares of common stock of software and ii the owners of outstanding series b preferred units of holdings contributed their series b preferred units of holdings to software in exchange for shares of common stock of software immediately after these contributions merger sub merged with and into holdings with holdings surviving the merger upon consummation of the merger the remaining holders of outstanding common and incentive units of holdings received shares of common and restricted stock of software for their common and incentive units by operation of delaware law and holdings’ ownership interest in software was cancelled outstanding common units series b preferred units and wcas holdings and cp iv blocker were contributed to software in exchange for or converted into an aggregate of 45708573 shares of common stock and 8121101 shares of restricted stock of software prior to the reorganization wcas holdings held 462 million of series c preferred units of holdings and wcas holdings had a 14 note due april 3 2017 in the amount of 462 million which was payable to wcas x the “2017 note” following the exchange of the series a preferred units and series b preferred units for shares of common stock of software all outstanding series c preferred units of holdings were eliminated in an intercompany transaction between holdings and wcas holdings we assumed the 2017 note and software became a holding company with its principal assets being the series b preferred units of holdings and the outstanding capital stock of wcas holdings and cp iv blocker the foregoing transactions are referred to collectively as the “2014 reorganization”

software’s acquisition of wcas holdings and holdings in the 2014 reorganization represented transactions under common control and were required to be retrospectively applied to the financial statements for all prior periods when the financial statements were issued for a period that included the date the transactions occurred this includes a retrospective presentation for all equity related disclosures including share per share and restricted stock disclosures which have been revised to reflect the effects of the 2014 reorganization therefore our consolidated financial statements are presented as if wcas holdings and holdings were our wholly owned subsidiaries in periods prior to the 2014 reorganization the acquisition of cp iv blocker was not deemed to be a reorganization under common control and therefore our historical consolidated financial statements include the ownership of a minority equity interest in cp iv blocker which was eliminated upon the acquisition of cp iv blocker in the 2014 reorganization on january 1 2014

trends and opportunities

our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications as a result of our evolving revenue mix coupled with the unique client benefits that our solution provides  eg  enabling our clients to scale the number of hcm applications that they use on an asneeded basis we are presented with a variety of opportunities and challenges

we generate revenues from i fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed or ii fixed amounts charged per billing period we do not require clients to enter into longterm contractual commitments with us our billing period varies by client based on when they pay their employees which is either weekly biweekly semimonthly or monthly

for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 our gross margins were approximately 84 82 and 81 respectively historically our total gross margin gradually improved over time as i our gross margin for our other hcm applications was higher than our gross margin for payroll processing ii we added additional clients iii our existing clients deployed additional hcm applications and iv we reduced our cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues we do not expect our gross margins to continue to grow at the same rate as they did between 2014 and 2015 but rather to remain relatively consistent

 

growi ng our business has also resulted in and will continue to result in substantial investment in sales professionals operating expenses systems development and programming costs and general and administrative expenses which has and will continue to incre ase our expenses we intend to obtain new clients by i continuing to expand our presence in metropolitan areas where we currently have an existing sales office through adding sales teams or offices and increasing the number of our sales professionals and ii opening sales offices in new metropolitan areas our ability to increase revenues and improve operating results depends on our ability to add new clients 

the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations and increased the number of applications we offer based on our total revenues we have grown at an approximately 41 cagr from january 1 2011 through december 31 2015 because we charge our clients on a per employee basis for certain services we provide any increase or decrease in the number of employees that our clients have will have a positive or negative impact on our results of operations our solution requires no adjustment to serve larger clients we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of potential clients and to increase our revenue per client with limited incremental cost to us

we believe the challenges of managing the everchanging complexity of payroll and human resources will continue to drive companies to turn to outsourced providers for help with their hcm needs the hcm industry historically has been driven in part by legislation and regulatory action including cobra changes to the minimum wage laws or overtime rules and legislation from federal state or municipal taxation authorities the implementation of the affordable care act the “aca” is the most recent example of legislation that has created demand in the hcm industry for the year ended december 31 2015 aca revenue represented less than 2 of total revenues and we estimate that revenues from enhanced aca will only represent approximately 5 of revenues for the year ending december 31 2016 we have extended until march 18 2016 the ability of clients and prospective clients to subject to certain conditions implement enhanced aca for purposes of filing their forms 1094 and 1095 for the 2015 fiscal year 

throughout our history we have built strong relationships with our clients as the hcm needs of our clients evolve we believe that we are wellpositioned to gain additional share of the hcm spending of our clients and we believe this opportunity is significant to be successful we must continue to demonstrate the operational and economic benefits of our solution as well as effectively hire train motivate and retain qualified personnel and executive officers

key metrics

in addition to the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” metrics that we regularly monitor we also monitor the following metrics to evaluate our business measure our performance and identify trends affecting our business

 



 







 





components of results of operations

sources of revenues

revenues are comprised of recurring revenues and implementation and other revenues we expect our revenues to increase as we introduce new applications expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients as a percentage of total revenues we expect our mix of recurring revenues and implementation and other revenues to remain relatively constant

recurring recurring revenues include fees for our talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for delivery of client payroll checks and reports these revenues are derived from i fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed or ii fixed amounts charged per billing period because recurring revenues are based in part on fees for use of our applications and the delivery of checks and reports that are levied on a peremployee basis our recurring revenues increase as our clients hire more employees recurring revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered 

implementation and other implementation and other revenues are comprised of implementation fees for the deployment of our solution and other revenue from sales of time clocks as part of our time and attendance services nonrefundable implementation fees which are charged to new clients are generated at inception for a new client and upon the addition of certain incremental applications for existing clients these fees range from 10 to 30 of the annualized value of the transaction implementation revenues are recorded as deferred revenues and recognized over the life of the client which is estimated to be 10 years and other revenues are recognized upon shipment of time clocks implementation and other revenues comprised approximately 21 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2015

provision for income taxes

for the three months ended december 31 2015 based on pretax income we had income tax expense of 11 million as compared to 20 million for the three months ended december 31 2014 the decrease in income tax expense of 09 million was primarily due to benefits of 06 million related to research and development activities and 12 million related to domestic production activities the income tax benefits were partially offset by increased pretax income

quarterly revenues trends 

excluding changes in quarterly revenues due to seasonal factors our quarterly revenues generally increased sequentially for the periods presented due to a combination of factors including the addition of clients in mature sales offices those offices that have been open for at least 24 months the addition of new clients in more recently opened sales offices the introduction and sale of additional applications to our existing clients and the growth in the number of employees of our clients we anticipate that commencing in 2016 first quarter revenues will also exhibit a stronger seasonal pattern as a result of the enactment of the aca which requires clients to file forms 1094 and 1095 in the first quarter

there are also seasonal factors that affect our revenues recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 or payroll form revenues because these forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year first quarter revenue and margins are generally higher than subsequent quarters

quarterly expenses trends

selling general and administrative expenses are generally higher in the fourth and first quarters as sales representatives achieve sales goals throughout the year resulting in higher commission rates these sales goals reset annually on february 1

liquidity and capital resources

our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents which totaled 507 million and 251 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively our cash and cash equivalents are comprised primarily of deposit accounts and money market funds we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months

we have historically financed our operations from cash flows generated from operations cash from the sale of debt and equity securities and borrowings under our consolidated loans since inception we have raised 1251 million of equity capital 643 million of which was the net proceeds raised in our initial public offering that closed in april 2014 we incurred related party debt as part of corporate reorganizations that occurred in april 2012 and january 2014 such debt has since been repaid we have also incurred indebtedness to finance the expansion of our corporate headquarters in oklahoma city the first expansion of our corporate headquarters was completed in june 2014 and we are currently constructing an approximately 136 million new corporate building adjacent to our corporate headquarters which we expect to be completed by mid to late2016 in connection with the expansion currently in progress we entered into a loan agreement with kirkpatrick bank on may 13 2015 the “construction loan” we are also negotiating a local incentive package with the oklahoma city economic development trust worth up to approximately 12 million depending on the number of new jobs we create for local employees over the next two years and the average annual salary level for such local employees 

2021 consolidated loan as of december 31 2015 we had a term note under the 2021 consolidated loan with an outstanding principal amount of 259 million due to kirkpatrick bank that matures on may 30 2021 under the 2021 consolidated loan interest is payable monthly and accrues at a fixed rate of 475 per annum the 2021 consolidated loan is secured by a mortgage covering our headquarters and certain personal property relating to our headquarters 

we are required to comply with certain financial and nonfinancial covenants under the 2021 consolidated loan including maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio of ebitda to fixed charges defined as current maturities of longterm debt interest expense rent expense and distributions greater than 12 to 10 which is measured on a quarterly basis as of december 31 2015 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the 2021 consolidated loan

pursuant to the terms of the 2021 consolidated loan until amounts under the 2021 consolidated loan are repaid we may not subject to certain exceptions i create any mortgages or liens ii make any loans advances or extensions of credit with any affiliate or enter into any other transaction with any affiliate iii lease any mortgaged property iv make any distributions as long as an event of default exists v make any material change in methods of accounting vi enter into any sale and leaseback arrangement vii amend modify restate cancel or terminate our organizational documents viii sell transfer or convey any mortgaged property or ix incur funded outside debt

an event of default under the 2021 consolidated loan includes among other events i failure to pay principal or interest when due ii breaches of certain covenants iii any failure to meet the required financial covenants and iv an institution of a bankruptcy reorganization liquidation or receivership

 

construction loan  on may 13 2015 we entered into the construction loan with kirkpatrick bank to finance the expansion of our headquarters the construction loan allows for the borrowing of a maximum aggregate principal amount equal to the lesser of i 110 million or ii 80 of the appraised value of the constructed property we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the construction loan as of decembe r 31  2015 to the extent we borrow under the construction loan until such amounts are repaid we will be subject to certain covenants similar to those described above with respect to the 2021 consolidated loan the construction loan matures on the earl ier of the completion of construction or november 13 2016 with variable interest accruing at the greater of i the prime rate plus 50 basis points or ii 40 

at maturity the outstanding principal balance of the construction loan if any will be automatically converted into a 78month term loan the term loan will accrue fixed interest at the prevailing 720 london interbank offered rate swap interest rate that is in effect as of the commencement date plus 225 basis points 

cash flow analysis

our cash flows from operating activities have historically been significantly impacted by profitability implementation revenue received but deferred research and development and our investment in sales and marketing to drive growth our ability to meet future liquidity needs will be driven by our operating performance and the extent of continued investment in our operations failure to generate sufficient revenue and related cash flows or to raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our liquidity needs and achieve our business objectives

as part of our payroll and payroll tax filing services we collect funds from our clients for federal state and local employment taxes which we remit to the appropriate tax agencies we invest these funds in shortterm certificates of deposit and money market funds from which we earn interest income during the period between their receipt and disbursement

as our business grows we expect our capital expenditures and our investment activity to continue to increase depending on certain growth opportunities we may choose to accelerate investments in sales and marketing acquisitions technology and services actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our future revenues cash from operating activities and the level of expenditures in all areas of our business

year ended december 31 2015 compared to the year ended december 31 2014 and the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the year ended december 31 2013

contractual obligations

our principal commitments primarily consist of longterm debt and leases for office space we disclose our longterm debt in note 5 and our commitments and contingencies in note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

as of december 31 2015 the future noncancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows in thousands

 



 

  

we may continue to lease additional office space to support our growth in addition many of our existing lease agreements provide us with the option to renew our future operating lease obligations include payments due during any renewal period provided for in the lease where the lease imposes a penalty for failure to renew

the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum services to be used fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above

offbalance sheet arrangements

as of december 31 2015 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results may materially differ from these estimates made by management under different assumptions and conditions

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are described below accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations

adoption of new pronouncement

we elected to early adopt on a retrospective basis the recently issued guidance by the fasb accounting standards update no 201517 “income taxes topic 740 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” “asu 201517” asu 201517 requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts adoption resulted in a reclassification which decreased current deferred income tax assets by 14 million and decreased noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities net by 14 million on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2014 adoption had no impact on our stockholders’ equity or the results of our operations

revenue recognition

our total revenues are comprised of recurring revenues and implementation and other revenues we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards for software and service companies when all of the following criteria have been met









recurring revenues are derived primarily from our talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management applications these services are rendered during each client’s payroll period with the agreedupon fee being charged and collected as part of the client’s payroll revenues are recognized at time of billing of each client’s payroll period collectability is reasonably assured as the fees are collected through ach as part of the client’s payroll cycle or through direct wire transfer which minimizes the default risk our implementation and other revenues represent non refundable conversion fees which are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client setup and revenues from sale of time clocks as part of our employee time and attendance services because these conversion fees and sale of time clocks relate to our recurring revenues we have evaluated such arrangements under the accounting guidance that governs multiple element arrangements

for arrangements with multiple elements we evaluate whether each element represents a separate unit of accounting in order to treat deliverables in a multiple element arrangement as separate units of accounting the deliverables must have standalone value upon 

 

delivery if the deliverables have standalone valu e upon delivery we account for each deliverable separately and revenue is recognized for the respective deliverables as they are delivered if one or more of the deliverables does not have standalone value upon delivery the deliverables that do not have standalone value are generally combined with the final deliverable within the arrangement and treated as a single unit of accounting 

for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 we determined that there was no standalone value associated with the upfront conversion fees as they did not have value to our clients on a standalone basis nor were they offered as an individual service therefore the conversion fees were deferred and are recognized ratably over the estimated life of our clients based on our historical client attrition rate which we estimate to be ten years revenues from the sale of time clocks are recognized when they are delivered

goodwill and other intangible assets

goodwill is not amortized but we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually or earlier if at the reporting unit level an indicator of impairment arises the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows if impairment exists a writedown to fair value is recorded our business is largely homogeneous and as a result goodwill is associated with one reporting unit we have selected june 30 as our annual goodwill impairment testing date and determined there was no impairment as of june 30 2015 for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 there were no indicators of impairment intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives

impairment of longlived assets

longlived assets including intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset we have determined that there is no impairment of longlived assets for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013

restricted stock and incentive units

given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock and incentive units prior to our initial public offering and in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants the “aicpa” audit and accounting practice aid series valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation the “aicpa practice guide” our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our restricted stock and incentive units including





















 

our simulation model requires various subjective assumptions as inputs including expected life volatility r iskfree interest rates and the expected dividend yield the assumptions used in the simulation model represent our best estimates which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment as follows 









the following tables present a summary of the grantdate fair values and related assumptions with respect to shares of restricted stock granted under the paycom software inc 2014 longterm incentive plan the “ltip” during the years ended december 31 2015 “2015 restricted stock” and 2014 “2014 restricted stock” the grantdate fair values were determined based on the monte carlo simulation model as discussed below the 2014 restricted stock was issued upon conversion of incentive units in connection with the 2014 reorganization we did not issue any shares of restricted stock during the year ended december 31 2013

 



 



 

the following table presents a summary of the grantdate fair values and related assumptions with respect to management incentive units “management incentive units” granted during the year ended december 31 2013 the grantdate fair values were determined based on the monte carlo simulation model

 

 



 

in addition to assumptions used in the simulation model we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our forfeiture estimate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover and other factors

 

the following table presents information about the 2015 restricted stock  

 



 



we granted the following management incentive units during 2013

 

 



1   represents the weighted average fair value per unit incorporating both timebased and marketbased vesting conditions



during 2013 management incentive units were issued with a strike price that was based on a 4000 million and 5500 million company enterprise value these strike prices are a vesting condition by which the underlying incentive units did not vest unless the value of our company met or exceeded the specified level the management incentive units did not have an exercise price there were no other equity instruments granted during the period from january 1 2013 to the date of the 2014 reorganization

we believe that there is no single event that caused the change in the fair value of our incentive units between the grant dates but rather a combination of factors described below for the significant difference noted in between certain grants as follow





in connection with the 2014 reorganization the incentive units we issued as part of the 2009 incentive units plan the “2009 incentive units” were converted into shares of restricted stock upon the sale of common stock in the initial public offering approximately 217378 shares of restricted common stock that were granted to replace the 2009 incentive units automatically vested

in connection with the 2014 reorganization incentive units of holdings including the management incentive units granted in 2013 were converted into shares of common stock andor restricted stock of software vested incentive units were converted to shares of common stock and restricted stock at various conversion ratios that ranged from approximately 102 to 124 unvested incentive units were converted to shares of restricted stock at various conversion ratios that ranged from 124 to 147 the conversion to shares of common stock or restricted stock was determined based on the underlying conditions of the preconversion incentive units and reflected any preexisting vesting conditions this conversion resulted in the issuance of 1148520 and 8121101 shares of common stock and restricted stock respectively on january 1 2014 the shares of restricted stock are subject to either timebased or marketbased vesting conditions the fasb accounting standards codification “asc” section 71820533 indicates that if the terms and conditions of an existing equity incentive compensation plan are to be modified then an entity should record additional compensation cost for any incremental value associated with the modification the incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess of the fair value of the modified awards over the fair value of the original awards immediately before its terms are modified based on the terms of restricted stock we concluded that there was a modification of the existing equity incentive units based upon a valuation by an independent third party management determined there was no additional compensation cost created in the conversion 

 

as the value of the incentive units given up was less than the value of the restricted stock received as such there was no additional compensation recorded 

shares of 2014 restricted stock that were subject to timebased vesting conditions retained substantially the same timebased vesting conditions as the respective tranche of incentive units from which they were converted the following tables show the vesting schedule for the outstanding shares of 2014 restricted stock subject to timebased vesting conditions

 



 

the following table shows the vesting schedule for outstanding shares of 2015 restricted stock subject to timebased vesting conditions

 



 

shares of 2014 restricted stock that were subject to marketbased vesting conditions vested 50 upon the company reaching a total enterprise value of 14 billion on december 1 2014 the remaining 50 vested upon the company reaching a total enterprise value of 18 billion on march 2 2015 

the following table shows the outstanding shares of 2015 restricted stock subject to marketbased vesting conditions

 



 

derivative instruments

in april 2012 we entered into a 10 senior note due 2022 with wcas capital iv a related party the note contained certain prepayment features related to mandatory redemption upon a liquidation event as of december 31 2012 we had identified the prepayment feature of the note as a derivative instrument which is required to be bifurcated and separately accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings refer to note 7 of our audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion the following are the significant inputs used to value the derivative instrument as of december 31 2013

 

 



 

there were no derivative instruments outstanding as of either december 31 2015 or 2014

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued authoritative guidance which included a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2016 and early adoption is not permitted in april 2015 the fasb proposed a one year deferral of the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard for public and nonpublic entities reporting under us gaap and on july 9 2015 the fasb approved the one year deferral the effective date of the amended standard will begin in periods beginning after december 15 2017 we are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements

in june 2014 the fasb issued authoritative guidance for sharebased payments which requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition as such the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award this update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered the new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2015 accordingly the standard is effective for us on january 1 2016 we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

in april 2015 the fasb issued authoritative guidance for intangibles related to internally developed software the new guidance will assist entities in evaluating the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement the new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2015 accordingly the standard is effective for us on january 1 2016 we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2015 the fasb issued authoritative guidance which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs under the new guidance debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability will be presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability the new guidance is effective for public entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2015 accordingly the standard is effective for us on january 1 2016 we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements debt issuance costs are currently included on our consolidated balance sheets as an asset

in july 2015 the fasb issued authoritative guidance which simplifies the measurement of inventory under the new guidance an entity should measure inventory as defined within the scope of the guidance at the lower of cost or net realizable value the new guidance applies to all inventory except inventory measured using lastin firstout lifo or the retail inventory method net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predicable costs of completion disposal and transportation the new guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within those fiscal years accordingly the standard is effective for us on january 1 2017 we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

in january 2016 the fasb issued authoritative guidance for the accounting for financial instruments the amendments in this guidance require all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee the amendments in this guidance also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrumentspecific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments in addition the amendments in this guidance eliminate the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet for public business entities the new guidance is effective for us for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 and early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements 

nongaap financial measures

we use ebitda adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income as supplemental measures to review and assess our performance and planning purposes we define i ebitda as net income loss plus interest expense taxes and depreciation and amortization ii adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation expense net loss on early repayment of debt and certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations and iii nongaap net income as unaudited pro forma net income loss plus tax adjusted stockbased compensation expense tax 

 

adjusted net loss on early repayment of debt and certain tax adjusted transaction expenses that are not core to our operations ebitda adjusted ebit da and nongaap net income are metrics that we believe are useful to investors in evaluating our performance and facilitating comparison with other peer companies many of which use similar nongaap financial measures to supplement results under us gaap 

ebitda adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income are not measures of financial performance under us gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income loss or pro forma net income loss as applicable which we consider to be the most directly comparable us gaap measures ebitda adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing our operating performance you should not consider ebitda adjusted ebitda or nongaap net income in isolation or as a substitute for net income unaudited pro forma net income loss or other consolidated statements of income data prepared in accordance with us gaap ebitda adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income may not be comparable to similar titled measures of other companies and other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do

the following tables reconcile net income to ebitda and adjusted ebitda and unaudited pro forma net income to nongaap net income dollars in thousands except share and per share amounts

interest rate sensitivity

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 507 million as of december 31 2015 we consider all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less and money market mutual funds to be cash equivalents these amounts 

 

are invested primarily in deposit accounts and money market funds the cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes our investments are made for capital preservation purposes we do not enter into in vestments for trading or speculative purposes 

our cash equivalents are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates

we do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition with respect to our cash equivalents

evaluation of controls and procedures

the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure we believe however that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error within a company if any have been detected 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2015 the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k based upon such evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date

paycom software inc

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of paycom software inc a delaware corporation and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 31 2015 based on criteria established in the 2013 internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 based on criteria established in the 2013 internal control—integrated framework issued by coso

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements of the company as of and for the year ended december 31 2015 and our report dated february 22 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

overview 

we are a leading provider of a comprehensive cloudbased hcm software solution delivered as saas we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions including talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and human resources “hr” management applications our userfriendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees enabling selfmanagement of their 

 

hcm activities in the cloud which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity 

organizations need sophisticated flexible and intuitive applications that can quickly adapt to their evolving hcm requirements streamline their hr processes and systems and enable them to control costs we believe that the hcm needs of most organizations are currently served either by legacy providers offering outdated onpremise products or multiple providers that partner together in an attempt to replicate a comprehensive product these approaches often result in large upfront capital requirements extended delivery times high costs low scalability and challenges with system integration 

because our solution was developed inhouse and is based on a single platform there is no need to integrate update or access multiple databases which are common issues with competitor offerings that use multiple thirdparty systems in order to link together their hcm offerings additionally our solution maintains data integrity for accurate actionable and realtime analytics and business intelligence and helps clients minimize the risk of compliance errors due to inaccurate or missing information we deliver featurerich applications while maintaining excellence in information security and quality management standards as evidenced by our international organization for standardization “iso” certifications as part of our client retention effort a specialist within a dedicated team is assigned to each client to provide industryleading personalized service 

the key benefits of our differentiated solution as compared to competing products include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

we sell our solution directly through our internally trained clientfocused and highly skilled sales force based in offices across the united states as a part of our client retention effort a specialist within a dedicated team is assigned to each client to provide industryleading personalized service we have over 12000 clients none of which constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 we believe that as a result of our focus on client retention we enjoy high client satisfaction as evidenced by an average annual revenue retention rate of 91 from existing clients for the three years ended december 31 2014 we believe our revenue retention rate understates our client loyalty because this rate also includes former clients that were acquired or otherwise ceased operations 

we were founded in 1998 since our founding we have focused on providing an innovative saas hcm solution as of december 31 2014 we had 1021 employees across the united states for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 our revenues were 1509 million 1076 million and 768 million respectively representing yearoveryear growth in revenues of approximately 40 and 40 respectively we currently derive the majority of our revenues from payroll processing we are able to determine revenues from payroll processing because all of our clients are required to utilize our payroll application in order to access our other applications we do not separately track our revenues across our other applications because we often sell applications in various groupings and configurations for a single price we realized net income loss of 57 million 06 million and 04 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

industry background 

large market opportunity for hcm technologies 

according to the international data corporation “idc” the us market for hcm applications is comprised of software that automates business processes covering the entire span of an employee’s relationship with his or her employer idc estimates that the us market excluding payroll services will total 70 billion in 2015 these applications include maintenance of hr records recruiting applications performance management time and labor management tracking compliance compensation management and other hr functions according to idc the us market for payroll services will be an estimated 168 billion in 2015 the payroll services market includes transactional activities associated with paying employees maintaining accounting records and administrating payroll taxes while payroll accounting applications offer the functionality to effectively track these various payments and transfers 

idc estimates that the international market for hcm applications excluding the united states and payroll services will be 52 billion in 2015 

economic and technological trends are driving demand for hcm solutions 

organizations operating in today’s global economy are continually under pressure to reduce operating costs in order to maintain or improve their competitive positions one tactic used by organizations is to utilize information technology “it” provided by external resources in order to automate internal processes reduce internal administrative burdens and more effectively manage capital expenditures and labor costs as a result businesses are increasingly making the strategic decision to leverage hcm technologies in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their internal hr and accounting functions and capture opportunities for cost savings 

organizations are also managing internal costs and administrative burdens by transitioning technological assets from onpremise to the cloud by shifting hr systems to the cloud businesses seek to avoid the difficulties associated with maintaining software and security updates and storage needs as well as other maintenance issues the rise of cloud computing has supported the saas delivery model according to idc the global saas market is projected to grow from 39 billion in 2013 to 103 billion in 2018 at a compound annual growth rate “cagr” of 21 

we believe that businesses increasingly view data concerning their human capital as a critical strategic resource that can result in more informed decisionmaking concerning employee recruitment retention and 

 

compensation this revolution in data analytics and its extension to hr functions has increased the number of employees within an organization that can benefit from and who regularly interface with information technologies as a result organizations seek intuitive technologies that do not require extensive training or advanced technological credentials to be effectively utilized the user experience of business applications is changing to emulate the consumer experience as hr buyers increasingly seek applications that are intuitive and available anywhere on any webenabled device 

incumbent hcm products struggle to meet the needs of businesses 

we believe that a majority of businesses and organizations in the united states are using multiple hcm systems from more than one vendor thereby impeding their ability to share data across these systems several incumbent payroll and hcm vendors offer product sets that are comprised of separate systems that require integration in certain cases this disparate product offering across several vendors is the result of several acquisitions which often leads to a loosely coupled product set that is marked by significant architectural differences and weak data integration we believe that this type of offering increases the risk of user or system error and reduces overall effectiveness 

a comprehensive hcm solution leverages the same data process and workflow management security model reporting and analytics tools and user portals to provide a uniform user experience we believe that significant analytical power remains trapped within the data that organizations are accessing across multiple applications and databases but are unable to analyze in a unified context 

we believe that vendors who pursue market segmentation strategies based on organization size or industry create difficulties for clients who grow either in size or industry scope beyond the confines of those vendors’ offerings a scalable hcm solution based on a core system of record allows for an organization to grow in size and scope without transitioning to a new user interface or backend database 

the paycom solution 

we offer an endtoend saas hcm solution that provides our clients and their employees with immediate access to accurate and secure information and analytics 24 hours a day seven days a week from any location we believe that our solution delivers the following benefits

softwareasaservice delivery model 

our saas delivery model allows clients with a geographically dispersed and mobile workforce to operate more efficiently and allows these clients to implement access and use our clientoriented internet solution on demand and remotely through standard web browsers smart phones tablets and other webenabled devices our saas solution reduces the time risk headcount and costs associated with installing and maintaining applications for onpremise products within the information technology infrastructure of our clients 

secure cloudbased architecture 

our cloudbased architecture allows our solution to be implemented remotely with minimal client interaction updates such as software enhancements and newly developed applications can be deployed without client interaction disruption or involvement allowing our clients to make a smaller investment in hardware personnel implementation time and consulting additionally we own and maintain all of the infrastructure technology to host our solution and to maximize system availability for clients our focus and investment in technology and data security has been recognized with isoiec 270012005 certified security standards that provide our clients with a “bestinclass” level of data security 

scalability to grow with our clients 

our solution is highly scalable we have served a diversified client base ranging in size from one to more than 8000 employees we calculate the number of clients’ employees based on parent company grouping our clients are able to use the same solution while their businesses grow by deploying applications asneeded in realtime pricing is determined by employee headcount and the number of applications utilized enabling our clients to align hcm spending with their evolving hcm needs as compared to traditional hcm products that require clients to migrate to new software as they grow but retain fixed costs even if the client shrinks in size 

efficient and productive research and development 

we believe that we benefit from a competitive advantage with our research and development investments people and processes early investments in our proprietary cloudbased architecture enables us to develop and deploy applications in a timely and costefficient manner we have also chosen to base our research and development team in oklahoma and texas which we believe provides us with highquality talent at a lower cost compared to other locations in the united states with a need for technology talent these strategic decisions have 

 

enabled us to have a highly productive research and development function while our research and development expenses grew 102 31 and 33 from the comparable year period for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

our strategy for growth 

our strategy is to continue to establish our solution as the hcm industry standard to accomplish this we intend to 

increase our presence in existing markets 

although we have clients in all 50 states we believe a significant opportunity exists to expand our presence within markets where we currently have a sales office we have a sales office in 29 of the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas “msas” in the united states based on 2010 us census data only one of which is served by multiple sales teams we believe that the 50 largest msas in the united states could collectively support at least 100 additional sales teams each sales office is typically staffed with one sales team with each team comprised of a sales manager and approximately six to nine other sales professionals we plan to increase our presence in existing markets by adding sales offices and increasing the number of our sales teams to further penetrate and effectively capture these markets 

expand into additional markets 

we plan to continue expanding our sales capability by opening sales offices in certain metropolitan areas where we currently have no sales teams we have identified 50 untapped metropolitan areas where we could potentially open a new sales office staffed with at least one sales team since september 2012 we have opened sales offices in baltimore brooklyn cincinnati detroit indianapolis kansas city minneapolis nashville new york philadelphia pittsburgh portland san francisco seattle and silicon valley we intend to open eight to twelve additional offices over the next two years as well as potentially expand over the longer term into international markets 

enlarge our existing client relationships 

we dedicate our resources to helping our clients facilitate their goals whether through helping them execute better hiring decisions manage compensation more effectively or simply operate more efficiently we believe a significant growth opportunity exists in selling additional applications to our current clients many clients have subsequently deployed additional applications as they recognize the benefits of our comprehensive solution as we extend and enhance the functionality of our solution we will continue to invest in initiatives to increase the adoption of our solution and maintain our high levels of client satisfaction 

target larger clients 

as we have organically grown our operations and increased the number of our applications the average size of our clients has also grown significantly based on our total revenues we have grown at an approximately 38 cagr from january 1 2009 through december 31 2014 our solution requires no adjustment to serve larger clients we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients and to increase our revenue per client with limited incremental cost to us to further capitalize on this opportunity we intend to target larger businesses opportunistically where our current sales model is effective 

maintain our leadership in innovation by strengthening and extending our solution 

our ability to develop and deploy new applications and updates rapidly and costeffectively has been integral to the results that we have achieved to date we intend to continue extending the functionality and range of our solution in the future our development efforts are performed exclusively inhouse and are heavily based upon proactive research and client input in the nearterm we intend to focus our investments on further 

 

developing applications within our higher margin hr and talent management applications over the long term we intend to increase our investment in the development of new applications that are responsive to the needs of our clients which are garnered through ongoing client interaction and collaboration 

our applications 

our hcm solution offers a full suite of applications that generally fall within the following categories talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management 

talent acquisition 

 

 time and labor management 

 

  

 payroll 

 

 talent management 

 

  

 hr management 

 

  

 our clients 

we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry we have over 12000 clients or nearly 8000 clients based on parent company grouping none of which constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 we stored data for more than 16 million persons employed by our clients during the year ended december 31 2014 

many of our clients that are small to midsized companies can typically make the decision to adopt our solution more quickly than larger companies which we believe results in a shorter sales cycle which more closely corresponds to our target sales cycle of 30 to 90 days as a result of the nature and size of our clientele we maintain a diversified client base and very low revenue concentration among our clients we believe however that larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients and to increase our revenue per client with limited incremental cost 

competition 

the market for hcm solutions is rapidly evolving highly competitive and subject to changing technology shifting client needs and frequent introduction of new products and services our competitors range from small regional firms to large wellestablished international firms with multiple product offerings 

we compete with firms that provide hcm solutions by various means many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software but as demand for greater flexibility and access to information grows we believe there will be increased competition in the delivery of hcm cloudbased solutions by other saas providers our competitors offer hcm solutions that may overlap with one several or all categories of applications offered by our solution our talent acquisition and talent management applications compete primarily with cornerstone ondemand inc oracle corporation sap ag and workday inc our payroll applications including payroll processing compete primarily with automatic data processing inc “adp” ceridian corporation concur technologies inc intuit inc paychex inc paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc our hr management applications compete primarily with adp ceridian corporation oracle corporation paychex inc sap ag and workday inc our time and labor management applications compete primarily with adp ceridian corporation paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc our larger competitors compete with us across multiple segments in addition our hcm solution continues to face competition from inhouse payroll and hr systems and departments as well as hr systems and software sold by thirdparty vendors 

competition in the hcm solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation breadth of service and application offering and price the importance of these factors depends on the size of the business price tends to be the most important factor of competition for smaller businesses with fewer employees while the scope of features and customization is more important to larger businesses we believe that our saas delivery model allows us to be most competitive in the hcm solutions market across this spectrum 

sales and marketing 

we sell our solution exclusively through our sales force substantially all of whom have a fouryear college degree our sales force is comprised of inside sales and field sales personnel who are organized geographically and client relations representatives “crrs” who sell additional applications to existing clients we have 34 sales teams located in 23 states and plan to open additional sales offices to further expand our presence in the us market 

 

we provide our sales force with an intensive fourweek training course that includes at least one week of training at our headquarters in oklahoma city our unique training program includes instruction in accounting business metrics application features and tax matters relevant to our target market our training continues for our sales force through weekly inoffice strategy sessions and leadership development training executive sales representatives are also required to attend inperson quarterly conferences to share best practices and receive legal and business updates 

when a new client processes with us for an entire month our sales representative receives a commission based upon annualized new recurring revenue this commission is only paid once per new customer executive sales representatives receive a higher commission rate and base salary based upon both current year and lifetodate realized sales respectively 

we generate client leads accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs that target finance and hr executives technology professionals and senior business leaders of companies that perform hcm functions inhouse or outsource these functions to one of our competitors our principal marketing programs include 

 

  

  

 our crrs are focused on expanding the number of applications our clients purchase from us by introducing them to additional applications our crrs call upon select clients periodically and are paid a nonrecurring commission on any additional sales they generate 

technology operations and security 

technology 

our multitenant architecture enables us to deliver our solution across our client base with a single instance of our solution while securely partitioning access to our clients’ respective application data because a single version of our solution is developed supported and deployed across all of our clients updates are delivered to all of our clients at the same time making it easier to scale our solution as the number of our clients and their employee headcount increases 

we maintain diverse loadbalanced internet lines serviced by multiple networks to provide our clients continuous access to our solution and their stored data we back up our client data at regular intervals utilizing live replication snapshots and cold archive methods of backup and manually monitor backup success and failure regularly our server cluster and database servers have redundant “hot swappable” disks to ensure continuous service in the event of a disk failure 

operations 

we physically host our solution for our clients in two secure data center facilities located in oklahoma and texas all of our critical systems are fully redundant and backedup in realtime to these facilities physical security includes idoriented access control alarm systems and manned 24 hour a day camera monitoring by our security guards server facilities also have environmental monitoring and extensive environmental controls such as heat and fire protection moisture temperature and humidity sensors backup power supply and exterior reinforced concrete walls 

 

security 

we maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of our clients’ data during the regular course of business we receive client data through our online system that we in turn process record and store following isoiec 2700012005 certified controls and procedures all communications with our servers that might contain sensitive information are encrypted before they leave the network and our servers are configured to only allow highgrade encryption algorithms 

we strictly regulate and limit all access to servers and networks at each of our facilities local network access is restricted by our authenticated server using access control lists and remote network access is restricted by a firewall which provides no accessible route from external networks to systems within our local network we also employ network and host intrusion detection and prevention sensors throughout our infrastructure systems that monitor and alert on insecure installations of thirdparty applications a full system for managing and installing patches for those applications and highly restricted access to the internet for anyone who has access to client data we retain a thirdparty penetration testing company to conduct penetration tests and periodic audits to identify and remediate any issues 

our applications are secured using multiple libraries and secure coding practices we engage in regular penetration testing performed by both our information security department as well as by a third party testing companies our information technology infrastructure is secured and monitored using a number of best practices and tools at multiple layers of the physical and logical network this security is also continually monitored by our information security department 

software development 

our application development team works closely with our clients to improve and enhance our application offerings and develop new applications our application development process consists of a focused innovation and development timeframe in order to deliver welldeveloped applications and enhancements desired by our clients a key element of our development process is the oneonone personal interaction between clients and our crrs through which our clients suggest new applications and features 

we develop our solution from the “ground up” with our internal development and engineering teams our development and engineering teams and our employees conceive of new applications and enhancements review requests schedule development in order of priority and subsequently develop the applications or enhancements our new applications and enhancements are independently reviewed by the quality assurance team in accordance with our software development process before being fully implemented any enhancements to our applications are released on a monthly scheduled release date to coordinate the communication and release to our clients 

capitalized development expenses which include compensation for employees directly associated with development projects were 22 million 12 million and 06 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

client service 

we are committed to providing industryleading clientcentered service for this reason we assign each client a specialist within a dedicated team this onetoone service is a key part of our client service model and helps to ensure that we are delivering an industryleading solution and maintaining high client satisfaction the primary elements of our client service model include the following 

streamlined setup and onboarding 

after a client elects to deploy our solution that client goes through our onboarding process with assistance from a team of new client setup specialists and the sales professional responsible for obtaining the client’s 

 

business this team works closely with the client until the client is capable of managing our solution independently in which case it is transferred to our dedicated services specialists 

dedicated service specialists 

after completing the onboarding process each client is assigned to a specialist within a dedicated team that provides primary support for the remainder of the client’s time with the company clients can then contact their dedicated services specialist or a team member if any issues or questions arise these specialists provide personalized service with actual knowledge of the clients’ business needs when appropriate client questions can be elevated to the specialists with the appropriate application regulatory or tax expertise in addition our crrs proactively contact our clients to ensure satisfaction with our solution and introduce additional applications 

expert level service 

our client specialists are trained across all of our applications to ensure that they can provide comprehensive expertlevel service our client service is iso 90012008 certified on the basis of its quality consistency and helps support a high client retention rate 

regulatory and certifications 

we are subject to varying degrees of regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide services local laws and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement differ significantly among those jurisdictions these regulations and laws cover among others information disclosure 

personal privacy has become a significant issue in the united states and in other countries the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future many federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations affecting or regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information in the united states these include for example rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the patient protection and affordable care act and state breach notification laws 

we voluntarily obtain third party security examinations relating to security and data privacy in accordance with statement on standards for attestation engagements “ssae” no 16 reporting on controls at a service organization our ssae examination is conducted every six months by an independent third party auditor and addresses among other areas our physical and environmental safeguards for production data centers data availability and integrity procedures change management procedures and logical security procedures 

in january 2014 we renewed a certification based on isoiec 270012005 criteria a security standard for information security management systems published by iso covering our production quality assurance and implementation environments this independent assessment of our conformity to the iso 27001 standard includes assessing security risks designing and implementing comprehensive security controls and adopting an information security management process to meet security needs on an ongoing basis the certification is valid until february 2017 with continuing assessments taking place annually 

in march 2014 we renewed a certification based on isoiec 90012008 criteria a standard for the implementation of quality management processes published by iso covering our activities required to create and deliver our solution this independent assessment of our conformity to the iso 9001 standard includes assessing the design and implementation of quality objectives to meet delivery standards on an ongoing basis the certification is valid until april 2017 with continuing assessments taking place annually 

 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights we also have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate we do not have any patents or patent applications pending 

seasonality 

our revenues are seasonal in nature recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs such as bonuses for our clients because these forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year first quarter revenue and margins are generally higher than in subsequent quarters in addition we often experience increased revenue during the fourth quarter due to unscheduled payroll runs for our clients that occur before the end of the year we believe this seasonality is driven by several factors most notably the number of our clients that use our payroll application as compared to the other applications that we offer as our clients use additional applications in the future we believe that the seasonality in revenues will gradually diminish 

employees 

our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees is critical to our continued success we invest heavily in our training and leadership development programs to encourage the development and promotion of our employees as of december 31 2014 we employed 1021 people none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements we consider our relationship with our employees to be good 

facilities 

our corporate headquarters is located in oklahoma city oklahoma on a 170000 square foot corporate campus that includes a 2271 square foot disaster recovery site located in oklahoma city we own over 30 acres in oklahoma city upon which our facilities are located we also own and operate a 1500 square foot fully redundant data center located at our corporate headquarters in oklahoma we also lease a 16870 square foot corporate campus in dallas texas that includes an approximately 300 square foot fully redundant data center 

we also lease offices in arizona california colorado florida georgia illinois indiana maryland massachusetts michigan minnesota missouri new jersey new york north carolina ohio oklahoma oregon pennsylvania tennessee texas virginia and washington we believe that these facilities are suitable for our current operations and upon the expiration of the terms of the leases we believe we could renew these leases or find suitable space elsewhere on acceptable terms 

segment information 

we operate in a single operating segment and a single reporting segment operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the chief executive officer in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance our chief executive officer allocates resources and assesses performance based upon financial information at the consolidated level since we operate in one operating segment all required financial segment information is presented in the consolidated financial statements

risks related to our business and industry 

our business depends substantially on our clients’ continued use of our applications their purchases of additional applications from us and our ability to add new clients any decline in our clients’ continued use of our applications or purchases of additional applications could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

in order for us to maintain or improve our operating results it is important that our current clients continue to use our applications and purchase additional applications from us and that we add new clients our clients have no obligation to continue to use our applications and may choose not to continue to use our applications at the same or higher level of service if at all in the past some of our clients have elected not to continue to use our applications moreover our clients generally have the right to cancel their agreements with us for any or no reason by providing 30 days prior written notice 

our client retention rates may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the level of client satisfaction with our applications pricing the prices of competing products or services mergers and acquisitions affecting our client base reduced hiring by our clients or reductions in our clients’ spending levels if our clients do not continue to use our applications renew on less favorable terms fail to purchase additional applications or if we fail to add new clients our revenues may decline and our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 

the market in which we participate is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 

the market for hcm software is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented we expect competition to intensify in the future with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants many of our current and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition longer operating histories more established relationships in the industry and significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as a result some of these competitors may be able to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 some of our principal competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures similarly some competitors offer different billing terms which has resulted in pressures on our billing terms if we are unable to maintain our pricing levels and our billing terms our operating results would be negatively impacted in addition pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales reduced margins losses or the failure of our solution to achieve or maintain widespread market acceptance any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

we compete with firms that provide hcm solutions by various means many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software but as demand for greater flexibility and access to information grows we believe there will be increased competition in the delivery of hcm cloudbased solutions by other saas providers our competitors offer hcm solutions that overlap with one several or all categories of applications offered by our solution our talent acquisition and talent management applications compete primarily with cornerstone ondemand inc oracle corporation sap ag and workday inc our payroll applications including payroll processing compete primarily with adp ceridian corporation concur technologies inc intuit inc paychex inc paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc our hr management applications compete primarily with adp ceridian corporation oracle corporation paychex inc sap ag and workday inc our time and labor management applications compete primarily with adp ceridian corporation paylocity holding corporation and the ultimate software group inc all of our larger competitors compete with us across multiple application categories in addition our hcm solution continues to face competition from inhouse payroll and hr systems and departments as well as hr systems and software sold by thirdparty vendors 

competition in the hcm solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness application quality and reputation breadth of service and product offering and price many of our competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products and services in addition many of our competitors have established marketing relationships access to larger client bases and major distribution agreements with consultants software vendors and distributors in addition some competitors may offer software that addresses one or a limited number of hcm functions at a lower price point or with greater depth than our solution as a result our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or client requirements further some potential clients particularly large enterprises may elect to develop their own internal solutions if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 

we have historically derived a majority of our revenues from payroll processing and our efforts to increase the use of our other hcm applications may not be successful and may reduce our revenue growth rate 

to date we have derived a majority of our revenues from payroll processing compared to payroll processing our participation in other hcm applications markets is relatively new and it is uncertain whether our revenue from other hcm applications will continue to grow the relatively limited extent to which our other hcm applications have been adopted by our clients and the uncertainty regarding the adoption of any new applications beyond our existing applications may make it difficult to evaluate our business because the potential market for such applications remains uncertain our hcm solution may not achieve and sustain the high level of market acceptance that is critical for the success of our business the failure to increase the use of our hcm applications and any new applications developed by us may reduce our revenue growth rate which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

if our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to data of our clients or their employees is otherwise obtained our solution may not be perceived as being secure clients may reduce the use of or stop using our solution and we may incur significant liabilities 

our solution involves the collection storage and transmission of clients’ and their employees’ confidential and proprietary information including personal or identifying information as well as financial and payroll data 

 

unauthorized access or security breaches could result in the loss of information litigation indemnity obligations and other liability while we have security measures in place to protect client and employee information and prevent data loss and other security breaches if these measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and someone obtains unauthorized access to our clients’ data our reputation could be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently we may not be able to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative or protective measures cyber liability insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our cyber liability insurance policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention 

any actual or perceived breach of our security could damage our reputation cause existing clients to discontinue the use of our solution prevent us from attracting new clients or subject us to thirdparty lawsuits regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

if the saas market develops more slowly than we expect or declines our growth may slow or stall and our business could be adversely affected 

the saas market is not as mature as the market for onpremise enterprise software and it is uncertain whether saas will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance our success will depend not only on strong demand for hcm services in general but also to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of saas many companies have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to saas it is difficult to predict client adoption rates and demand for our solution the future growth rate and size of the saas market or the entry of competitive products the expansion of the saas market depends on a number of factors including the cost performance and perceived value associated with saas as well as the ability of saas providers to address security and privacy concerns if other saas providers experience security incidents loss of client data disruptions in delivery or other problems the market for saas applications as a whole including our solution may be negatively affected if saas does not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for saas caused by a lack of client acceptance technological challenges weakening economic conditions security or privacy concerns competing technologies and products decreases in corporate spending or otherwise our growth may slow or stall and our business could be adversely affected 

any interruption or failure of our data centers could impair our ability to effectively provide our solution and adversely affect our business 

we serve all of our clients from our two data centers located in oklahoma and texas these locations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from severe weather tornados terrorist attacks earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses or cyberattacks they are also subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct our solution depends on the continuing operation of our data centers and any damage to or failure of our data centers could result in interruptions in our services any interruption in our service could damage our reputation cause our clients to terminate their use of our solution and prevent us from gaining new or additional business from current clients which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

any significant disruption in our saas network infrastructure could harm our reputation and expose us to significant costs 

our saas network infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations our clients access our solution through standard web browsers smart phones tablets and other webenabled devises and depend on us for fast 

 

and reliable access to our solution in the future we may experience disruptions in our computing and communications infrastructure factors that may cause such disruptions include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if our saas network infrastructure or our clients’ ability to access to our solution is interrupted client and employee data from recent transactions may be permanently lost and we could be exposed to significant claims by clients particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds due to employees any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to retain clients and sell our solution which would adversely impact our revenues 

we have also experienced significant growth in the number of clients transactions and client and employee data that our network infrastructure supports we seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our network infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our clients and their employees and to facilitate the rapid provision of new client deployments and the expansion of existing client deployments any changes in the service levels at our data centers or any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our network infrastructure could adversely affect our reputation and may result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our solution any interruptions in the availability of our solution might reduce our revenues cause us to issue refunds to clients or adversely affect our retention of existing clients 

if our solution fails to perform properly our reputation could be adversely affected and our market share could decline 

our solution is inherently complex and may in the future contain or develop undetected defects or errors any defects in our applications could adversely affect our reputation impair our ability to sell our applications in the future and result in significant costs to us the costs incurred in correcting any application defects may be substantial and could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition any defects in functionality or that cause interruptions in the availability of our applications could result in 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our clients regard as significant furthermore the availability or 

 

performance of our solution could be adversely affected by a number of factors including the failure of our network system or solution or security breaches we may be liable to our clients for damages they may incur resulting from certain of these events in addition to potential liability if we experience interruptions in the availability of our solution our reputation could be adversely affected and we could lose clients 

our clients might assert claims against us in the future alleging that they suffered damages due to a defect error or other failure of our solution our errors and omissions insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention 

if we do not effectively expand and train our sales force and our support teams we may be unable to add new clients and retain existing clients 

we need to continue to expand our sales force and support team members in order to grow our client base and increase our revenues identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use of our applications requires significant time expense and attention and it can take a substantial amount of time before our sales representatives and support team members are fullytrained and productive we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we currently or intend in the future to do business and our recent hires and planned hires may not achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time or become as productive as we expect if our expansion efforts are unsuccessful or do not generate a corresponding increase in revenues our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 

if we are not able to develop enhancements and new applications keep pace with technological developments or respond to future disruptive technologies we might not remain competitive and our business could be adversely affected 

our future success will depend on our ability to adapt and innovate to attract new clients and increase revenues from existing clients we need to enhance add new features to and improve our existing applications and introduce new applications the success of any enhancements or new features and applications depends on several factors including timely completion introduction and market acceptance we may expend significant time and resources developing and pursuing sales of a particular application that may not result in revenues in the anticipated time frame or at all or may not result in revenue growth sufficient to offset increased expenses if we are unable to successfully develop enhancements new features or new applications to meet client needs our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

in addition because our applications are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using internet tools and protocols we will need to continuously modify and enhance our applications to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication browser and database technologies if we are unable to respond in a timely and costeffective manner to these rapid technological developments our current and future applications may become less marketable and less competitive or even obsolete 

our success is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver hcm solutions at lower prices more efficiently or more conveniently such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete 

the market for our solution among large companies may be limited if these companies demand customized features and functions that we do not offer 

prospective clients especially larger companies may require customized features and functions unique to their business processes that we do not offer in order to ensure we meet these requirements we may devote a significant amount of support and services resources to larger prospective clients increasing the cost and time 

 

required to complete sales with no guarantee that these clients will continue to use our solution further we may not be successful in implementing any customized features or functions if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we do not offer or that would be difficult for them to deploy themselves then the market for our solution will be more limited and our business could be adversely affected 

our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth and organizational change if we fail to manage such growth and change effectively we may be unable to execute our business plan maintain high levels of service or adequately address competitive challenges 

we have experienced and may continue to experience rapid growth in our headcount and operations which has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management operational and financial resources for example our headcount has grown from 523 employees as of december 31 2011 to 1021 employees as of december 31 2014 and we have expanded from 18 offices as of december 31 2011 to 29 offices as of december 31 2014 we have also experienced significant growth in the number of clients transactions and client and employee data that our infrastructure supports finally our organizational structure and recording systems and procedures are becoming more complex as we improve our operational financial and management controls our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth and organizational change effectively to manage the expected growth of our headcount and operations we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures our ability to add additional offices may be constrained by the willingness and availability of qualified personnel to help staff and manage any new offices the failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulties or delays in obtaining clients selling additional applications to our clients declines in quality or client satisfaction of our applications increases in costs and difficulties in introducing new applications or other operational difficulties any of which could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract clients or sell additional applications to our existing clients 

our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our deployment or technical support services 

our business depends on our ability to satisfy our clients both with respect to our applications and the technical support provided to help clients use the applications that address the needs of their businesses we use our inhouse deployment personnel to implement and configure our solution and provide support to our clients if a client is not satisfied with the quality of our solution or the applications delivered or the support provided we could be required to incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of our solution might be negatively affected and the client’s dissatisfaction with our deployment service could damage our ability to sell additional applications to that client in addition our sales process is highly dependent on the reputation of our solution and applications and on positive recommendations from our existing clients any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality technical support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell our applications to existing and prospective clients and our business operating results or financial condition 

if we fail to retain key employees and recruit qualified technical and sales personnel our business could be adversely affected 

we believe that our success depends on the continued services of our senior management and other key employees including chad richison craig e boelte jeffrey d york and william x kerber iii in addition because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new applications we are heavily dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified software developers and it personnel with the requisite education background and industry experience to continue to execute our growth strategy we must also attract and retain qualified sales marketing and operational personnel capable of supporting a larger and more diverse client base the loss of the services of a significant number of our developers or sales professionals could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships in addition if any of our key employees joins a competitor or decides to otherwise compete with us we may experience a material disruption of our 

 

operations and development plans which may cause us to lose clients or increase operating expenses or divert management’s attention to recruit replacements for the departed key employees 

our financial results may fluctuate due to many factors some of which may be beyond our control 

our results of operations including the levels of our revenues costs of revenues administrative expenses operating income cash flow and deferred revenue may vary significantly in the future and the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance our financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control and as a result may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business fluctuation in our financial results may negatively impact the value of our common stock factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate from period to period include without limitation 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 certain of our operating results and financial metrics are difficult to predict as a result of seasonality 

we have historically experienced seasonality in our revenues because a significant portion of our recurring revenues relate to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 because these forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year first quarter revenues are generally higher than subsequent quarters we expect this seasonality to continue in the future which may cause fluctuations in certain of our operating results and financial metrics and thus make such results and metrics difficult to predict 

 

if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights our competitive advantage could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets generate reduced revenue or incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

our success is dependent in part upon our intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks service marks trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and to protect our intellectual property rights however the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property despite our precautions it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our applications and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products or services that compete with ours 

we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property we have been involved in litigation in the past and litigation may be necessary in the future to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets such litigation could be costly timeconsuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights we may not be able to secure protect and enforce our intellectual property rights or control access to and the distribution of our solution and proprietary information 

we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 

considerable intellectual property development activity exists in our industry and we expect that software developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of applications and competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps our competitors as well as a number of other entities and individuals may own or claim to own intellectual property in technology areas relating to our solution or applications in addition we may increasingly be subject to trademark infringement claims as our presence grows in the marketplace from time to time third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights a claim of infringement may also be made relating to technology that we acquire or license from third parties however we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover or may be alleged to cover some or all of our solution applications or brands 

for example on september 23 2014 in anticipation of an alleged trademark infringement claim we filed a complaint against national financial partners corp in the united states district court for the western district of oklahoma civil action no 514cv01029r seeking a declaratory judgment that we have not engaged in any trademark infringement or unfair competition in connection with the use of our logo on september 23 2014 national financial partners corp filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois civil action no 114cv07424 the complaint alleges trademark infringement unfair competition deceptive trade practices consumer fraud and deceptive business practices related to the adoption and use of our logo and seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting us from continued infringement as well as money damages including an accounting for sales and profits attorneys’ fees and disgorgement of profits on october 16 2014 national financial partners corp filed a motion to dismiss the action pending in the western district of oklahoma on october 20 2014 we filed a motion to transfer the action from the northern district of illinois to the western district of oklahoma and a memorandum in support of the motion to transfer in the northern district of illinois on december 12 2014 the united states district court for the western district of oklahoma granted national financial partners corp’s motion to dismiss national financial partners corp has moved for an order preliminarily enjoining us from using our logo in the northern district of illinois on january 5 2015 we filed an answer affirmative defenses and counterclaim in the northern district of illinois denying the material allegations in national financial corp’s complaint and seeking a declaratory judgment that we have not engaged in any trademark infringement with respect to the use of our logo on february 15 2015 the northern district of illinois denied our motion to transfer the venue and scheduled the lawsuit for trial in the northern district of illinois in february 2016 the northern district of illinois has not yet 

 

ruled on national financial partners corp’s motion for a preliminary injunction the northern district of illinois will set a briefing schedule on the motion filed by nfp asking the court to enter a preliminary injunction prohibiting our use of our logo pending the outcome of the action nfp’s motion for a preliminary injuction will be heard in the western district of oklahoma we intend to vigorously defend this litigation in the event that a court ultimately determines that we have infringed any of the asserted trademarks or grants national financial partners corp’s motion for a preliminary injunction we may be subject to damages which may include treble damages be enjoined from using our current logo while the parties are litigating the merits of the claims or be required to modify our logo andor undergo a rebranding of our solution and applications we cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the litigation or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages 

the outcome of the foregoing litigation matter is inherently unpredictable and therefore as a result of this litigation matter or any future claim of infringement a claim could i cause us to enter into an unfavorable royalty or license agreement pay ongoing royalties or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms ii require us to discontinue the sale of our solution or applications iii require us to indemnify our clients or thirdparty service providers or iv require us to expend additional development resources to redesign our solution or applications any of these outcomes could harm our business even if we were to prevail any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business and operations 

we employ thirdparty licensed software for use in our applications and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs or reduced service levels which could adversely affect our business 

our applications incorporate certain thirdparty software obtained under licenses from other companies we anticipate that we will continue to rely on such thirdparty software and development tools from third parties in the future although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the thirdparty software we currently license this may not always be the case or it may be difficult or costly to replace in addition integration of the software used in our applications with new thirdparty software may require significant work and substantial investment of our time and resources also to the extent that our applications depend upon the successful operation of thirdparty software in conjunction with our software any undetected errors or defects in this thirdparty software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our applications delay new application introductions result in a failure of our applications and harm our reputation 

the use of open source software in our applications may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property rights 

some of our applications use software covered by open source licenses from time to time there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate such software into their products or applications as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software litigation could be costly for us to defend have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional development resources to change our applications in addition if we were to combine our applications with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain of the open source licenses be required to release the source code of our applications if we inappropriately use open source software we may be required to redesign our applications discontinue the sale of our applications or take other remedial actions 

we may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development activities for several years if at all 

developing saasbased applications is expensive and the investment in the development of these applications often involves a long return on investment cycle we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development activities accelerated application introductions and short 

 

software life cycles require increased levels of research and development expenditures that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by increased revenues we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development activities to maintain our competitive position we may not receive significant revenues from these investments however for several years if at all 

the failure to develop our brand costeffectively could have an adverse effect on our business 

we believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a costeffective manner is critical to achieving the widespread acceptance of our solution and is an important element in attracting new clients and retaining existing clients successful promotion of our brand depends largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful applications at competitive prices brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues and even if they do any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brand if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand we may fail to attract enough new clients or retain our existing clients to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding efforts which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we might require additional capital to support business growth and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms if at all 

we have funded our operations since inception through cash flows generated from operations cash from the sale of debt and equity securities and borrowings under consolidated loans in the future we may require additional capital to support our growth and respond to operational challenges including the need to develop new features and applications or enhance our existing applications improve our infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies accordingly we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds if we raise additional funds through issuances of equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities including potential acquisitions in addition we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it our ability to continue to support our growth and respond to challenges could be significantly limited 

our outstanding indebtedness is subject to certain operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities and may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business 

as of december 31 2014 we had a term note under the 2021 consolidated loan with an outstanding principal amount of 270 million due to kirkpatrick bank that matures on may 30 2021 the “2021 consolidated loan” the 2021 consolidated loan is secured by a mortgage covering our headquarters buildings and certain personal property relating to our headquarters buildings pursuant to the terms of the 2021 consolidated loan we may not subject to certain exceptions until amounts under the 2021 consolidated loan are repaid 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition under the 2021 consolidated loan we are required to maintain a debt coverage ratio of ebitda to indebtedness defined as current maturities of longterm debt interest expense and distributions of greater than 15 to 10 the operating and financial covenants in the 2021 consolidated loan as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into may restrict our ability to finance our operations engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies we may also be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on our debt which would reduce the amount of money we have for operations working capital expansion or other general corporate purposes 

our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations and comply with the operating and financial covenants may be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to control many of these factors and comply with these covenants a breach of any of the covenants under the 2021 consolidated loan could result in an event of default which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under the 2021 consolidated loan to become immediately due and payable 

we may acquire other businesses applications or technologies which could divert our management’s attention result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses applications or technologies that we believe complement or expand our applications enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities the pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur expenses in identifying investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions whether or not they are ultimately consummated 

we do not have any experience in acquiring other businesses if we acquire additional businesses we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel operations and technologies successfully or to effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition we also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition a significant portion of the purchase price of any companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets which must be assessed for impairment at least annually in the future if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process which could harm our results of operations acquisitions could also result in issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt which would result in dilution to our stockholders 

our growth depends in part on the success of our relationships with third parties 

we rely on thirdparty financial and accounting processing systems as well as various financial institutions to perform financial services in connection with our applications such as providing automated clearing house “ach” and wire transfers as part of our payroll and expense reimbursement services and to provide technology and content support manufacture time clocks and process background checks we anticipate that we will continue to depend on various thirdparty relationships in order to grow our business provide technology and content support manufacture time clocks and process background checks identifying negotiating and documenting relationships with these third parties and integrating thirdparty content and technology requires significant time and resources our agreements with third parties typically are nonexclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors in addition these third parties may not perform as expected under our agreements and we may have disagreements or disputes with such third parties which could negatively affect our brand and reputation a global economic slowdown could also adversely affect the businesses of our third party providers particularly those financial institutions that process transactions through the ach network and it is possible that they may not be able to devote the resources we expect to our relationship 

if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected even if we are successful these relationships may not result in improved operating results 

adverse economic conditions could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

our business depends on the overall demand for hcm applications and on the economic health of our current and prospective clients if economic conditions in the united states remain uncertain or deteriorate clients may cease their operations or delay or reduce their hcm spending or the number of their employees this could result in reductions in sales of our applications longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition any of which could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition in addition hcm spending levels may not increase following any recovery 

if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as of december 31 2014 we had recorded a total of 519 million of goodwill and 51 million of other intangible assets an adverse change in market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of our critical assumptions or estimates made in connection with the impairment testing of goodwill or intangible assets could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge to our goodwill or other intangible assets any such material charges may have a negative impact our operating results 

 

we typically pay employees and may pay taxing authorities amounts due for a payroll period before a client’s electronic funds transfers are finally settled to our account if client payments are rejected by banking institutions or otherwise fail to clear into our accounts we may require additional sources of shortterm liquidity and our operating results could be adversely affected 

our payroll processing application moves significant funds from the account of a client to employees and relevant taxing authorities for larger funding amounts we require clients to transfer the funds to us via fed wire for smaller funding amounts we debit a client’s account prior to any disbursement on its behalf and due to ach banking regulations funds previously credited could be reversed under certain circumstances and time frames after our payment of amounts due to employees and taxing and other regulatory authorities there is therefore a risk that the employer’s funds will be insufficient to cover the amounts we have already paid on its behalf while such shortage and accompanying financial exposure has only occurred in very limited circumstances in the past should clients default on their payment obligations in the future we might be required to advance substantial funds to cover such obligations in such an event we may be required to seek additional sources of shortterm liquidity which may not be available on reasonable terms if at all and our operating results and our liquidity could be adversely affected and our banking relationships could be harmed 

because our long term success depends in part on our ability to expand the sales of our solution to clients located outside of the united states our business will be subject to risks associated with international operations 

an element of our growth strategy is to expand our operations and client base to date we have not engaged in any operations outside of the united states if we decide to expand our operations into international markets it will require significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory economic and political risks that are different from those in the united states because of our lack of experience with international operations we cannot assure you that our international expansion efforts will be successful 

risks related to legislation or regulation 

privacy concerns and laws or other domestic regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our applications 

our applications require the storage and transmission of the proprietary and confidential information of our clients and their employees including personal or identifying information as well as their financial and payroll data our applications are subject to varying complex government laws and regulations on the federal state and local levels including those governing personal privacy which has become a significant issue in the united states the regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future many federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use and disclosure of personal information in the united states these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the patient protection and affordable care act federal and state labor and employment laws and state data breach notification laws 

in addition to government regulation privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different selfregulatory standards because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws are still uncertain it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our solution any failure to comply with government regulations that apply to our applications including privacy and data protection laws could subject us to liability in addition to the possibility of fines lawsuits and other claims we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our solution which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition any inability to adequately address privacy concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws regulations and policies could result in additional cost 

 

and liability to us damage our reputation inhibit sales and adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

furthermore privacy concerns may cause our clients’ employees to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our clients or their employees to use our applications effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our applications in certain industries all of these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the ability of our clients to process handle store use and transmit demographic and personal information from their employees which could reduce demand for our applications 

changes in laws and regulations related to the internet or changes in the internet infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for our applications and could have a negative impact on our business 

the future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the internet as a primary medium for commerce communication and business federal state and foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet as a commercial medium changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our applications in order to comply with these changes in addition government agencies or private organizations may impose taxes fees or other charges for accessing the internet or commerce conducted via the internet these laws or charges could limit the growth of internetrelated commerce or communications generally or result in reductions in the demand for internetbased applications such as ours 

in addition the use of the internet as a means of conducting business could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of internet activity security reliability cost ease of use accessibility and quality of service the performance of the internet has been adversely affected by “viruses” “worms” and similar malicious programs and the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure if the use of the internet is adversely affected by these issues demand for our applications could suffer 

if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected 

we will be required pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as amended the “sarbanesoxley act” to furnish a report by management on among other things the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending december 31 2015 and in each year thereafter our auditors will also need to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the future to the extent we are no longer an emerging growth company as defined by the jumpstart our business startups act the “jobs act” and are not a smaller reporting company 

if we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated we are in the process of designing and implementing internal control over financial reporting to comply with this obligation which process will be time consuming costly and complicated if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting if we are unable to comply with the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports we could become subject to investigations by the new york stock exchange “nyse” the sec or other regulatory authorities and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected 

 

we have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies 

as a new public company we have incurred since our initial public offering and expect to continue to incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements for example we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the sarbanesoxley act as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the sec and the nyse including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and changes in corporate governance practices 

we expect that complying with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more timeconsuming and costly in particular we have incurred and expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act which will increase to the extent we are no longer an emerging growth company as defined by the jobs act and are not a smaller reporting company we cannot fully predict or estimate the amount or timing of future costs associated with being a public company which could adversely affect our operating results 

the increased costs associated with operating as a public company may decrease our net income or result in a net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our solution additionally if these requirements divert management’s attention from other business concerns they could have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

as a public company we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage for director and officer liability insurance or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers 

we are an emerging growth company and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors 

we are an emerging growth company under the jobs act emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and therefore we are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies pursuant to section 102 of the jobs act we have reduced executive compensation disclosure and have omitted a compensation discussion and analysis from this annual report on form 10k 

for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company we intend to take advantage of certain other exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation the frequency of the nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved and the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act investors may find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile 

we will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of i the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds 700 million as of june 30th ii the end of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of 1 billion or more during such fiscal year iii the date on which we issue more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt in a threeyear period and iv december 31 2019 

 

adverse tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our clients which could increase the costs of our solution and applications and could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

the application of federal state and local tax laws to services provided electronically is evolving new income sales use or other tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time possibly with retroactive effect and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services and applications provided over the internet these enactments could adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and ultimately could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

in addition existing tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be interpreted changed modified or applied adversely to us possibly with retroactive effect which could require us or our clients to pay additional tax amounts as well as require us or our clients to pay fines or penalties and interest for past amounts if we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our clients we could be held liable for such costs thereby adversely affecting our business operating results or financial condition 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance 

from time to time we have released and may continue to release guidance in our earnings conference calls earnings releases or otherwise regarding our future performance that represents our estimates as of the date of release this guidance which includes forwardlooking statements has been and will be based on projections prepared by our management these projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections accordingly no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections 

projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that while presented with numerical specificity are inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions some of which will change the principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such third parties 

guidance is necessarily speculative in nature and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will vary significantly from actual results accordingly our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material in light of the foregoing investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock 

any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this “risk factors” section in this annual report on form 10k could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance and the differences may be adverse and material 

the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the current market price 

the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future if an active trading market for our common stock is not sustained you may have difficulty selling any shares of our common stock that you purchased and the value of such shares may be materially impaired the 

 

market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies in the past stockholders have filed securities class actions following periods of market volatility if we were to become involved in securities litigation it could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

substantial blocks of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market when the “lockup” period for our followon offering ends on april 14 2015 if there are substantial sales of shares of our common stock the price of our common stock could decline 

the price of our common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our common stock particularly sales by our directors executive officers and significant stockholders shares held by directors executive officers and certain other affiliates will be eligible to be resold in the public market once the lockup period for the followon offering ends on april 14 2015 subject to volume limitations under rule 144 under the securities act and restrictions under the terms of various restricted stock award agreements 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if no or few securities or industry analysts cover our company the trading price for our common stock would be negatively impacted if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes incorrect or unfavorable research about our business our common stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our common stock could decrease which could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline 

 

our principal stockholders hold a controlling interest in our common stock and may make business decisions with which you disagree and which may adversely affect the value of an investment in the company 

as of january 30 2015 the parties to an amended and restated stockholders agreement the “stockholders agreement” which include chad richison shannon rowe william x kerber iii jeffrey d york robert j levenson and the estate of richard aiello and certain of their affiliates or related entities and welsh carson anderson  stowe x lp “wcas x” wcas capital partners iv lp “wcas capital iv” and wcas management corporation collectively the “stockholders agreement parties” beneficially owned or controlled directly or indirectly 40226418 shares of common stock in the aggregate equal to approximately 689 of our outstanding shares as a result of this ownership and the provisions of the stockholders agreement wcas x wcas capital iv and wcas management corporation and certain of their affiliated funds collectively “wcas funds” or “welsh carson anderson  stowe” will have the ability to control matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election and removal of directors amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of any business combination these actions may be taken even if they are opposed by other stockholders this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares which could prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares 

some of these persons or entities may have interests different than yours for example because many of these stockholders purchased their shares at prices substantially below the current market price of our common stock and have held their shares for a longer period they may be more interested in selling the company to an acquirer than other investors or may want us to pursue strategies that deviate from the interests of other stockholders 

we are deemed a “controlled company” and as a result will qualify for and intend to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements 

the stockholders agreement parties currently own more than a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock so long as such persons collectively own a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock we will be a “controlled company” within the meaning of corporate governance standards of the nyse under those standards a company of which more than 50 of the voting power for the election of directors is held by another company or group is a “controlled company” and need not comply with certain requirements including 1 the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors 2 the requirement that there be a nominating and corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities 3 the requirement that there be a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and 4 the requirement of an annual performance evaluation of the nominatingcorporate governance and compensation committees we may rely on any of these exemptions for so long as we are a “controlled company” as a result we will not have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors and our compensation committee does not consist entirely of independent directors if we are no longer eligible to rely on the controlled company exception we intend to comply with all applicable corporate governance requirements but we will be able to rely on phasein periods for certain of these requirements in accordance with the nyse’s rules accordingly our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all nyse corporate governance requirements 

the issuance of additional stock in connection with acquisitions our stock incentive plans warrants or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to one hundred million shares of common stock and up to ten million shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations we may issue all of these shares that are not already outstanding without any action or approval by our stockholders we intend to continue to 

 

evaluate strategic acquisitions in the future we may pay for such acquisitions partly or in full through the issuance of additional equity securities 

any issuance of shares in connection with an acquisition the exercise of stock options or warrants the award of shares of restricted stock or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by our existing stockholders 

we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future consequently stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company 

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

generally accepted accounting principles in the united states are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change

overview 

we are a leading provider of a comprehensive cloudbased hcm software solution delivered as saas we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions including talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management applications our userfriendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees enabling selfmanagement of their hcm activities in the cloud which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity 

we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry we have over 12000 clients none of which constituted more than onehalf of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 we stored data for more than 16 million persons employed by our clients during the year ended december 31 2014 

our revenues are primarily generated through our sales force that solicits new clients and our client relations representatives “crrs” who sell new applications to existing clients we have 34 sales teams located in 23 states and plan to open additional sales offices to further expand our presence in the us market in recent years we have opened approximately three to four new sales offices in new cities per year and believe that we can open eight to twelve additional sales offices over the next two years during the year ended december 31 2014 we opened five new sales offices with one sales office located in each of baltimore indianapolis philadelphia portland and silicon valley to date during 2015 we opened five new sales offices with one new sales office located in each of brooklyn cincinnati kansas city nashville and pittsburgh 

our continued growth depends on attracting new clients through geographic expansion further penetration of our existing markets and the introduction of new applications to our existing client base we also expect a portion of our growth to generally mirror improvements in the labor market our principal marketing programs include telemarketing and email campaigns search engine marketing methods and national radio advertising 

during the last three years we have developed several new applications our ability to continue to develop new applications and to improve existing applications will enable us to increase revenues in the future and the number of our new applications adopted by our clients has been a significant factor in our revenue growth over the last three years 

recent developments 

followon offering 

on january 21 2015 we closed our followon public offering whereby 6422750 shares of our common stock were sold to the public by certain selling stockholders at a public offering price of 2250 per share 

 

initial public offering 

on april 21 2014 we closed our initial public offering whereby an aggregate of 7641750 shares of our common stock were sold to the public including 4606882 shares of common stock issued and sold by us and 3034868 shares of common stock sold by certain selling stockholders at a public offering price of 1500 per share we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders the total gross proceeds we received from the offering were 691 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us the aggregate net proceeds we received totaled approximately 643 million we used all of the net proceeds from the offering together with approximately 33 million from existing cash for the repayment in full of the 10 senior note due 2022 the “2022 note” issued by us to wcas capital iv and the 14 note due 2017 issued by wcas holdings the “2017 note” 

the 2014 reorganization 

software and its whollyowned subsidiary payroll software merger sub llc “merger sub” were formed as delaware entities on october 31 2013 and december 23 2013 respectively in anticipation of an initial public offering “ipo” and were whollyowned subsidiaries of holdings prior to december 31 2013 

on january 1 2014 we consummated a reorganization pursuant to which i affiliates of welsh carson anderson  stowe contributed wcas holdings and cp iv blocker which collectively owned all of the series a preferred units of holdings to software in exchange for shares of common stock of software and ii the owners of outstanding series b preferred units of holdings contributed their series b preferred units of holdings to software in exchange for shares of common stock of software immediately after these contributions merger sub merged with and into holdings with holdings surviving the merger upon consummation of the merger the remaining holders of outstanding common and incentive units of holdings received shares of common stock of software for their common and incentive units by operation of delaware law and holdings’ ownership interest in software was cancelled outstanding common units series b preferred units and wcas holdings and cp iv blocker were contributed to software in exchange for or converted into 45708573 shares of common stock and 8121101 shares of restricted stock of software prior to the reorganization wcas holdings held series c preferred units of holdings in the amount of 462 million and wcas holdings had a note payable to a related party due april 3 2017 in the amount of 462 million following these transactions all outstanding series c preferred units of holdings were eliminated in an intercompany transaction between holdings and wcas holdings and we assumed the 2017 note following the reorganization software became a holding company with its principal assets being the series b preferred units of holdings and the outstanding capital stock of wcas holdings and cp iv blocker collectively the “2014 reorganization” 

software’s acquisition of wcas holdings and holdings in the 2014 reorganization represented transactions under common control and were required to be retrospectively applied to the financial statements for all prior periods when the financial statements were issued for a period that included the date the transactions occurred this includes a retrospective presentation for all equity related disclosures including share per share and restricted stock disclosures which have been revised to reflect the effects of the 2014 reorganization therefore our consolidated financial statements are presented as if wcas holdings and holdings were our whollyowned subsidiaries in periods prior to the 2014 reorganization the acquisition of cp iv blocker was not deemed to be a reorganization under common control and therefore our historical consolidated financial statements include the ownership of a minority equity interest in cp iv blocker which was eliminated upon the acquisition of cp iv blocker in the 2014 reorganization on january 1 2014 

trends opportunities and challenges 

while we currently derive most of our revenues from payroll processing we expect an increasing percentage of our recurring revenues to come from our additional hcm applications over time our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order 

 

to access our other applications as a result of our evolving revenue mix coupled with the unique client benefits that our solution provides eg enabling our clients to scale the number of hcm applications that they use on an asneeded basis we are presented with a variety of opportunities challenges and risks 

we generate revenues from i fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed or ii fixed amounts charged per billing period we do not require clients to enter into longterm contractual commitments with us our billing period varies by client based on when they pay their employees which is either weekly biweekly semimonthly or monthly 

we do not have a traditional subscriptionbased revenue model and do not enter into longterm contractual commitments with our clients we believe that the traditional subscription model hinders the buying decision by requiring clients to make significant commitments at inception as well as at the end of each subscription term by allowing clients to discontinue the use of our solution with 30 days’ notice our team of trained specialists must focus on providing the best client service in contrast a longterm contract often forces a client to continue using a product that may not entirely fit its needs or in some cases incur expensive termination fees because of our sales model and personalized service we have maintained high client satisfaction as evidenced by an average annual revenue retention rate of 91 from existing clients for the three years ended december 31 2014 

for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 our gross margin was approximately 82 81 and 79 respectively we expect changes in our revenue mix to gradually improve gross margin over time as sales of applications other than payroll processing increase as a percentage of revenues given that our current gross margin for our other hcm applications is higher than our gross margin for payroll processing we expect that our total gross margin will gradually improve over time as i we add additional clients ii our existing clients deploy additional hcm applications and iii we reduce our costs of revenues and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues 

growing our business has also resulted in and will continue to result in substantial investment in sales professionals operating expenses systems development and programming costs and general and administrative expenses which has and will continue to increase our expenses we intend to obtain new clients by i continuing to expand our presence in metropolitan areas where we currently have an existing sales office through adding sales teams or offices and increasing the number of our sales professionals and ii opening sales offices in new metropolitan areas our ability to increase revenues and improve operating results depends on our ability to add new clients 

as we have organically grown our operations and increased the number of our applications the average size of our clients has also grown significantly based on our total revenues we have grown at an approximately 38 cagr from january 1 2009 through december 31 2014 because we charge our clients on a per employee basis for certain services we provide any increase or decrease in the number of employees that our clients have will have a positive or negative impact on our results of operations our solution requires no adjustment to serve larger clients we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of potential clients and to increase our revenue per client with limited incremental cost to us 

throughout our history we have built strong relationships with our clients as the hcm needs of our clients evolve we believe that we are wellpositioned to gain additional share of the hcm spending of our clients and we believe this opportunity is significant to be successful we must continue to demonstrate the operational and economic benefits of our solution as well as effectively hire train motivate and retain qualified personnel and executive officers 

 

key metrics 

in addition to the us gaap metrics that we regularly monitor we also monitor the following metrics to evaluate our business measure our performance and identify trends affecting our business 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 components of results of operations 

sources of revenues 

revenues are comprised of recurring revenues and implementation and other revenues recurring revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered implementation and other revenues includes implementation revenues that are recorded as deferred revenues and recognized over the life of the client which is estimated to be ten years and other revenues which are recognized upon shipment of time clocks implementation and other revenue comprised approximately 18 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 we expect our revenues to increase as we introduce new applications expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients as a percentage of total revenues we expect our mix of recurring revenues and implementation and other revenues to remain relatively constant 

 

recurring recurring revenues include fees for our talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for delivery of client payroll checks and reports these revenues are derived from i fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed or ii fixed amounts charged per billing period because recurring revenues are based in part on fees for use of our applications and the delivery of checks and reports that are levied on a peremployee basis our recurring revenues increase as our clients hire more employees 

implementation and other implementation and other revenues are comprised of implementation fees for the deployment of our solution and other revenue from sales of time clocks as part of our time and attendance services nonrefundable implementation fees which are charged to new clients are generated at inception for a new client and upon the addition of certain incremental applications for existing clients these fees range from 10 to 30 of the annualized value of the transaction 

expenses 

cost of revenues  cost of revenues consists of expenses related to hosting and supporting our applications hardware costs systems support and technology and depreciation of certain owned computer equipment these costs include employeerelated expenses for client support personnel bank charges for processing ach transactions certain implementation expenses along with delivery charges and paper costs they also include our cost for time clocks sold and ongoing technology and support costs related to our systems depreciation of owned computer equipment is allocated based upon an estimate of assets used to host and support our applications we expect our cost of revenues to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in new applications and expand our client base although we expect our overall cost of revenues to gradually decrease as a percentage of total revenues over time 

administrative expenses administrative expenses consist of sales and marketing research and development general and administrative and depreciation and amortization sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employeerelated expenses for our direct sales and marketing staff commissions bonuses marketing expenses and other related costs research and development expenses consist primarily of employeerelated expenses for our development staff net of capitalized software costs for internally developed software we expect to grow our research and development efforts as we continue to broaden our payroll and hr solution offerings and extend our technological solutions by investing in the development of new applications and introducing them to new and existing clients general and administrative expenses include employeerelated expenses for finance and accounting legal human resources and management information systems personnel legal costs professional fees and other corporate expenses depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation of owned computer equipment allocated based upon an estimate of assets used to support the selling general and administrative functions as well as amortization of intangible assets we expect our administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars due to additional costs associated with accounting compliance investor relations and other costs associated with being a public company although our administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues 

loss on repayment of debt 

during 2014 we wrote off 41 million related to the discount associated with the repayment of certain related party debt 

interest expense 

interest expense includes interest on our corporate headquarters and related party debt the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 is primarily due to our use of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and existing cash for the repayment in full of the 2022 note and the 2017 note in april 2014 

other income net 

other income net includes the gain or loss on the sale of fixed assets interest on funds held for clients that are earned primarily on funds that are collected in advance of either the applicable due date for payroll tax 

 

submissions or the applicable disbursement date for employee payment services and change in fair value of the derivative liability relating to the related party debt we typically invest funds held for clients in money market accounts and certificates of deposit until they are paid to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees these collections from clients are typically disbursed from one to 30 days after receipt with some funds being held for up to 120 days we expect that interest on funds held for clients in other income will increase as we increase our cash and cash equivalents and increase our funds held from clients as we introduce new applications expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients

quarterly revenues trends 

excluding changes in quarterly revenues due to seasonal factors our quarterly revenues generally increased sequentially for the periods presented due to a combination of factors including the addition of clients in mature sales offices those offices that have been open for at least 24 months the addition of new clients in more recently opened sales offices the introduction and sale of additional applications to our existing clients and the growth in the number of employees of our clients in addition the annual processing of payroll forms were subject to a onetime price increase in conjunction with increased access and review functionality associated with these forms in 2012 which resulted in an increase of less than 1 of recurring revenues for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

there are also seasonal factors that affect our revenues recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w2 and form 1099 or payroll form revenues because these forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year first quarter revenue and margins are generally higher than subsequent quarters 

quarterly expenses trends 

selling general and administrative expenses are generally higher in the fourth and first quarters as sales representatives achieve sales goals throughout the year resulting in higher commission rates these sales goals reset annually on february 1 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents which totaled 251 million and 134 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively our cash and cash equivalents are comprised primarily of deposit accounts and money market funds we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months 

we have historically financed our operations from cash flows generated from operations cash from the sale of debt and equity securities and borrowings under our consolidated loans since inception we have raised 1251 million of equity capital 643 million of which was the net proceeds raised in our initial public offering that closed in april 2014 we have also incurred indebtedness to finance the expansion of our corporate headquarters which was completed in june 2014 as well as other previously constructed facilities and incurred related party debt as part of a corporate reorganization that occurred in april 2012 the “april 2012 corporate reorganization” and the 2014 reorganization we may be required to incur additional indebtedness within the next twelve months to finance the further expansion of our corporate headquarters as of december 31 2014 our only outstanding indebtedness consisted of the 2021 consolidated loan which is discussed in more detail below 

2021 consolidated loan as of december 31 2014 we had a term note under the 2021 consolidated loan with an outstanding principal amount of 270 million due to kirkpatrick bank that matures on may 30 2021 under the 2021 consolidated loan interest is payable monthly and accrues at a fixed rate of 475 per annum the 2021 consolidated loan is secured by a mortgage covering our headquarters buildings and certain personal property relating to our headquarters buildings 

we are required to comply with certain financial and nonfinancial covenants under the 2021 consolidated loan including maintaining a debt coverage ratio of ebitda to indebtedness defined as current maturities of longterm debt interest expense and distributions greater than 15 to 10 as of december 31 2014 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the 2021 consolidated loan 

pursuant to the terms of the 2021 consolidated loan we may not subject to certain exceptions until amounts under the 2021 consolidated loan are repaid i create any mortgages or liens ii make any loans advances or extensions of credit with any affiliate or enter into any other transaction with any affiliate iii lease any mortgaged property iv make any distributions to members as long as an event of default exists v make 

 

any material change in methods of accounting vi enter into any sale and leaseback arrangement vii amend modify restate cancel or terminate our organizational documents viii sell transfer or convey any mortgaged property or ix incur funded outside debt 

an event of default under the 2021 consolidated loan includes among other events i failure to pay principal or interest when due ii breaches of certain covenants iii any failure to meet the required financial covenants and iv an institution of a bankruptcy reorganization liquidation or receivership 

cash flow analysis 

our cash flows from operating activities have historically been significantly impacted by profitability implementation revenue received but deferred and our investment in sales and marketing to drive growth our ability to meet future liquidity needs will be driven by our operating performance and the extent of continued investment in our operations failure to generate sufficient revenue and related cash flows or to raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our liquidity needs and achieve our business objectives 

as part of our payroll and payroll tax filing services we collect funds for federal state and local employment taxes from our clients which we remit to the appropriate tax agencies we invest these funds in shortterm certificates of deposit and money market funds from which we earn interest income during the period between their receipt and disbursement 

as our business grows we expect our capital expenditures and our investment activity to continue to increase depending on certain growth opportunities we may choose to accelerate investments in sales and marketing acquisitions technology and services actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our future revenues cash from operating activities and the level of expenditures in all areas of our business 

year ended december 31 2014 compared to the year ended december 31 2013 and the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the year ended december 31 2012

for the year ended december 31 2014 cash flows provided by financing activities was 2085 million the cash flows provided by financing activities resulted primarily from an increase in client funds obligations of 2048 million related to the collection of client taxes gross proceeds from our initial public offering of 628 million and proceeds from the issuance of debt of 65 million which were partially offset by payments on longterm debt of 657 million 

for the year ended december 31 2013 cash flows provided by financing activities was 1314 million the cash flows provided by financing activities resulted primarily from an increase in client funds obligations of 1315 million related to the collection of client taxes and advances received from longterm debt of 70 million which were partially offset by distributions paid to members of 54 million 

contractual obligations 

our principal commitments primarily consist of longterm debt and leases for office space we disclose our longterm debt to a related party in note 5 and our commitments and contingencies in note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

as of december 31 2014 the future noncancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

  

 we may continue to lease additional office space to support our growth in addition many of our existing lease agreements provide us with the option to renew our future operating lease obligations include payments due during any renewal period provided for in the lease where the lease imposes a penalty for failure to renew 

the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum services to be used fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2014 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results may materially differ from these estimates made by management under different assumptions and conditions 

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are described below accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

our total revenues are comprised of recurring revenues and implementation and other revenues we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards for software and service companies when all of the following criteria have been met 

 

  

  

  

 recurring revenues are derived primarily from our talent acquisition time and labor management payroll talent management and hr management applications these services are rendered during each client’s payroll period with the agreedupon fee being charged and collected as part of the client’s payroll revenues are recognized at time of billing of each client’s payroll period collectability is reasonably assured as the fees are collected through ach as part of the client’s payroll cycle or through direct wire transfer which minimizes the default risk our implementation and other revenues represent non refundable conversion fees which are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client setup and revenues from sale of time clocks as part of our employee time and attendance services because these conversion fees and sale of time clocks relate to our recurring revenues we have evaluated such arrangements under the accounting guidance that governs multiple element arrangements 

for arrangements with multiple elements we evaluate whether each element represents a separate unit of accounting in order to treat deliverables in a multiple element arrangement as separate units of accounting the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery if the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery we account for each deliverable separately and revenue is recognized for the respective deliverables as they are delivered if one or more of the deliverables does not have standalone value upon delivery the deliverables that do not have standalone value are generally combined with the final deliverable within the arrangement and treated as a single unit of accounting 

for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 we determined that there was no standalone value associated with the upfront conversion fees as they did not have value to our clients on a standalone basis nor were they offered as an individual service therefore the conversion fees were deferred and are recognized 

 

ratably over the estimated life of our clients based on our historical client attrition rate which we estimate to be ten years revenues from the sale of time clocks are recognized when they are delivered 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill is not amortized but we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually or earlier if at the reporting unit level an indicator of impairment arises the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows if impairment exists a writedown to fair value normally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows is recorded our business is largely homogeneous and as a result goodwill is associated with one reporting unit we have selected june 30 as our annual goodwill impairment testing date and determined there was no impairment as of june 30 2014 for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 there were no indicators of impairment intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets including intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset we have determined that there is no impairment of longlived assets for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

restricted stock and incentive units 

given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock and incentive units prior to our initial public offering and in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants the “aicpa” audit and accounting practice aid series valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation the “aicpa practice guide” our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our restricted stock and incentive units including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

our simulation model requires various subjective assumptions as inputs including expected life volatility riskfree interest rates and the expected dividend yield the assumptions used in the simulation model represent our best estimates which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment as follows 

 

  

  

  

 the following table presents a summary of the grantdate fair values of restricted stock granted based on the monte carlo simulation model and the related assumptions for the year ended december 31 2014 we did not issue any shares of restricted stock during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 

 

 the following table presents a summary of the grantdate fair values of incentive units granted based on the monte carlo simulation model and the related assumptions for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 

 

 in addition to assumptions used in the simulation model we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our forfeiture estimate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover and other factors 

 

we granted the following management incentive units the “management incentive units” between october 1 2012 and the date of the 2014 reorganization in thousands except per unit amounts 

 

  

  there were no other equity instruments granted during the period from october 1 2012 to the date of the 2014 reorganization during 2012 management incentive units were issued with a strike price that was based on a 4000 million company enterprise value during 2013 management incentive units were issued with a strike price that was based on a 4000 million and 5500 million company enterprise value we also issued incentive units to our chief executive officer the “ceo incentive units” with a strike price that was based on a 5500 million company enterprise value during 2012 these strike prices are a vesting condition by which the underlying incentive units did not vest unless the value of our company met or exceeded the specified level our incentive units did not have an exercise price 

we believe that there is no single event that caused the change in the fair value of our incentive units between the grant dates but rather a combination of factors described below for the significant difference noted in between certain grants as follow 

 

  

 in connection with the 2014 reorganization the incentive units we issued as part of the 2009 incentive units plan the “2009 incentive units” were converted into shares of restricted stock upon the sale of common stock in the initial public offering approximately 217378 shares of restricted common stock that were granted to replace the 2009 incentive units automatically vested 

in connection with the 2014 reorganization incentive units in holdings were converted into shares of common stock andor restricted stock vested incentive units were converted to shares of common stock and restricted stock at various conversion ratios that ranged from approximately 102 to 124 unvested incentive units were converted to shares of restricted stock at various conversion ratios that ranged from 124 to 147 the conversion to shares of common stock or restricted stock was determined based on the underlying conditions of the preconversion incentive units and reflected any preexisting vesting conditions this conversion resulted in the issuance of 1148520 and 8121101 shares of common stock and restricted stock respectively on january 1 2014 the shares of restricted stock are subject to either timebased or performancebased vesting conditions the fasb accounting standards codification “asc” section 71820533 indicates that if the terms and conditions of an existing equity incentive compensation plan are to be modified then an entity should record 

 

additional compensation cost for any incremental value associated with the modification the incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess of the fair value of the modified awards over the fair value of the original awards immediately before its terms are modified based on the terms of restricted stock we concluded that there was a modification of the existing equity incentive units based upon a valuation by an independent third party management determined there was no additional compensation cost created in the conversion as the value of the incentive units given up was less than the value of the restricted stock received as such there was no additional compensation recorded 

shares of restricted stock that were issued in connection with the 2014 reorganization that were subject to timebased vesting conditions retained substantially the same timebased vesting conditions as the respective tranche of incentive units from which they were converted for additional information concerning these vesting conditions see “executive compensation—narrative discussion regarding summary compensation table—equity incentive units and restricted stock awards” the following table shows the vesting periods for the outstanding shares of restricted stock subject to timebased vesting conditions that were issued in connection with the 2014 reorganization 

 

 shares of restricted stock that were issued in connection with the 2014 reorganization that were subject to performancebased vesting conditions vested 50 upon the company reaching a total enterprise value of 14 billion on december 1 2014 the remaining 50 will vest upon the company reaching a total enterprise value of 18 billion provided that the person is employed by us on that date for additional information concerning these vesting conditions see “executive compensation—narrative discussion regarding summary compensation table—equity incentive units and restricted stock awards” if the company’s stock price remains at or near its current price the company believes that the shares of restricted stock that are subject to the performancebased vesting condition of a total enterprise value of 18 billion will vest during the first quarter of 2015 

the following table shows the outstanding shares of restricted stock subject to the applicable performancebased vesting conditions that were issued in connection with the 2014 reorganization 

 

  

derivative instruments 

in april 2012 we entered into the 2022 note with wcas capital iv a related party the note contained certain prepayment features related to mandatory redemption upon a liquidation event as of december 31 2012 we had identified the prepayment feature of the note as a derivative instrument which is required to be bifurcated and separately accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings refer to note 7 of our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 for further discussion the following are the significant inputs used to value the derivative instrument as of december 31 2013 and 2012 

 

 there were no derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2014 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued authoritative guidance which adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” the update requires that an entity present either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of aoci based on its source and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification the amendment is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on after december 15 2012 we adopted this new guidance as of the year ended december 31 2013 this guidance has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued authoritative guidance which added new disclosure requirements to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangement for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of this guidance is fixed at the reporting date and disclose the arrangements and the total outstanding amount of obligation for all joint parties these disclosures are in addition to existing related party disclosure requirements we adopted this new guidance as of the year ended december 31 2013 this guidance has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in july 2013 the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires entities to present an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward we adopted this new guidance for the year ended december 31 2013 which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued authoritative guidance which included a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services the new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2016 and early adoption is not permitted accordingly the standard is effective for us on january 1 2017 we are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2014 the fasb issued authoritative guidance for sharebased payments which requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition as such the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair 

 

value of the award this update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered the new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2015 accordingly the standard is effective for us on january 1 2016 we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

nongaap financial measures 

we use ebitda adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income as supplemental measures to review and assess our performance and planning purposes we define i ebitda as net income loss plus interest expense taxes and depreciation and amortization ii adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation expense net loss on early extinguishment of debt and certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations and iii nongaap net income as unaudited pro forma net income loss plus tax adjusted stockbased compensation expense tax adjusted net loss on early extinguishment of debt and certain tax adjusted transaction expenses that are not core to our operations ebitda adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income are metrics that we believe are useful to investors in evaluating our performance and facilitating comparison with other peer companies many of which use similar nongaap financial measures to supplement results under us gaap 

ebitda adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income are not measures of financial performance under us gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income loss or pro forma net income loss as applicable which we consider to be the most directly comparable us gaap measures ebitda adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing our operating performance you should not consider ebitda adjusted ebitda or nongaap net income in isolation or as a substitute for net income unaudited pro forma net income loss or other consolidated statements of income data prepared in accordance with us gaap ebitda adjusted ebitda and nongaap net income may not be comparable to similar titled measures of other companies and other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do 

the following tables reconcile net income loss to ebitda and adjusted ebitda and unaudited pro forma net income loss to nongaap net income loss in thousands except per share amounts

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate sensitivity 

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 251 million as of december 31 2014 we consider all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less and money market mutual funds to be cash equivalents these amounts are invested primarily in deposit accounts and money market funds the cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes our investments are made for capital preservation purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

our cash equivalents are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 

we do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100basis points would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition with respect to our cash equivalents

executive compensation program overview 

the primary elements of our executive compensation program include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our compensation committee after reviewing compensation information it considers relevant has determined what it believes to be the appropriate level and mix of the various compensation components for our named executive officers ultimately the objective in allocating between longterm and shortterm compensation is to ensure adequate base compensation to attract and retain personnel while providing incentives to maximize longterm value for our company and our stockholders 

base salary 

we provide base salaries to our named executive officers to compensate them for services rendered during the fiscal year and to recognize their experience skills knowledge and responsibilities each of our named executive officers is currently party to an employment agreement no formulaic base salary increases are provided to our named executive officers pursuant to the terms of their employment agreements however on an annual basis our compensation committee reviews and evaluates with input from our chief executive officer the need for adjustment of the base salaries of our named executive officers for additional information concerning the employment agreements see “compensation arrangements adopted in connection with our initial public offering—employment agreements” 

for 2012 messrs richison york boelte and kerber received an annual base salary of 495051 330028 260020 and 260028 respectively for 2013 messrs richison york boelte and kerber received an annual base salary of 534788 343363 280954 and 280963 respectively for 2014 messrs richison york boelte and kerber received an annual base salary of 555197 367102 291600 and 300358 respectively which reflects the compensation committee’s six percent 6 increase in the base salary of messrs york and kerber effective as of july 1 2014

equity incentive units and restricted stock awards 

prior to 2014 our award of equity incentive units was the primary vehicle for offering longterm incentives to our executive officers including our named executive officers while we do not have any equity ownership guidelines for our named executive officers we believe that equity incentive unit grants and restricted stock 

 

awards provide our named executive officers with a strong link to our longterm performance create an incentive to achieve longrange performance goals and objectives and help to align the interests of our named executive officers and our stockholders in 2012 and 2013 we issued equity incentive units to each of our named executive officers in 2014 we issued shares of common stock and restricted stock to our named executive officers to replace previously granted awards of equity incentive units 

material terms of equity incentive unit grants 

we have historically granted awards of equity incentive units to our named executive officers with a portion of the units being subject to timebased vesting conditions and a portion being subject to performancebased vesting conditions prior to the vesting of equity incentive units the holder has no rights as a stockholder with respect to the shares subject to such unit including voting rights or the right to receive dividends dividend equivalents or distributions
