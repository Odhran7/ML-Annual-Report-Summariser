 item 1a risk factors 

 

we operate in rapidly changing economic political and technological environments that present numerous risks our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows our ability to successfully execute our strategy and the trading price of our common stock or debt the following discussion identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect the company this information should be read in conjunction with managements discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in our forwardlooking statements and from historical trends

 

risks related to our business 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely impact the global economy and disrupt our operations and supply chains which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

covid19 has impacted and may further impact the global economy and could have additional impacts on economic growth the proper functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates the pandemic has resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures such as travel restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders vaccine mandates and facility shutdowns these measures have impacted and may continue to impact our workforce operations and supply chains and those of our customers contract manufacturers and suppliers particularly in the event of a significant global resurgence of the illness there is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration scope and severity of the pandemic and the impacts on our business and the global economy from the effects of the ongoing pandemic and response measures 

 

inflationary price pressures and uncertain availability of commodities raw materials utilities labor or other inputs used by us and our suppliers or instability in logistics and related costs could negatively impact our profitability  

 

increases in the price of commodities raw materials utilities labor or other inputs that we or our suppliers use in manufacturing and supplying products components and parts along with logistics and other related costs may lead to higher production and shipping costs for our products parts and components further increasing global demand for and uncertain supply of such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers’ ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner to meet our supply needs andor could lead to increased costs any increase in the cost of inputs to our production could lead to higher costs for our products and could negatively impact our operating results future profitability and ability to successfully deliver on our strategy increasing prices to our customers to offset the impact of higher costs may cause certain of our customers to push out cancel or refrain from purchasing our products which could materially adversely impact demand for our products and therefore also negatively impact our operating results future profitability and ability to successfully deliver on our strategy

 

supply chain disruptions manufacturing interruptions or delays or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand could affect our ability to meet customer demand lead to higher costs or result in excess or obsolete inventory if we are unable to obtain the necessary equipment raw and batch materials natural resources or utilities required in our products or processes our business will be negatively impacted 

 

corning’s business relies on its timely supply of materials equipment services and related products to meet the changing technical and volume requirements of its customers which depends in part on the timely delivery of materials equipment and services from suppliers and contract manufacturers significant and sudden increases in demand for such materials equipment and services as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions have resulted in and may continue to result in a shortage of materials equipment and services needed to manufacture corning’s products such shortages have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements and corning’s manufacturing operations and its ability to meet customer demand some key materials equipment and services are subject to long leadtimes or available only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment can increase capital technical operational and other risks for corning and for companies throughout our supply chain and may cause some suppliers to exit businesses or scale back or cease operations which could impact our ability to meet customer demand

  

 

our ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of equipment raw and batch materials natural resources or utilities equipment parts components and raw materials from our suppliers we may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations certain manufacturing equipment components and raw materials are available only from single or limited sources and we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner a reduction interruption or delay of supply or a significant increase in the price for supplies such as manufacturing equipment precious metals raw materials utilities including energy and industrial water could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

corning may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations delays in its ability to deliver products or services increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of

 

  

corning ’ s display technologies segment generates a significant amount of the company ’ s profits and cash flow any significant decrease in display glass pricing or market share could have a material and negative impact on our financial results 

 

corning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely on the profitability of our display glass business which is subject to continuous pricing pressure due to industry competition potential overcapacity and development of new technologies if we are not able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs andor increases in volume to offset ongoing pricing pressure it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results

 

because we have a concentrated customer base future sales and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the actions or loss of one or more key customers 

 

a relatively small number of end customers accounted for a high percentage of our net sales this concentration subjects us to a variety of risks including

 

   

the following table details the number of combined customers of our segments that accounted for a large percentage of segment net sales

 

  

 

events outside of corning ’ s control or those of our contract manufacturers could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers resulting in a negative impact to corning ’ s net sales net income asset values and liquidity 

 

disruption to our manufacturing operations or those of our contract manufacturers could significantly impact corning’s ability to supply its customers and could produce a nearterm severe impact on our individual business units and the company given the geographical concentration of certain of the companys and our contract manufacturers plants the highly engineered nature of the facilities and the globally dispersed talent required to run these facilities any event that adversely affects or restricts movement into or out of a specific geographic area where we our contract manufacturers our suppliers or our customers have a presence could adversely impact our results due to the specialized nature of our products and singlesite manufacturing locations in the event such a location experiences disruption it we may not be possible to find replacement capacity or substitute production from other facilities 

 

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights which could result in loss of market share and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

 

we rely on patent and trade secret laws copyright trademark confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses we cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of or the unauthorized use of our intellectual property potentially resulting in loss of market share litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are unpredictable if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive

 

the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios we periodically receive notices from or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights andor breach of our agreements with them these third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design manufacture or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us

 

information technology dependency and cybersecurity vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue liability claims competitive or reputational harm and result in material adverse effects on our operations and financial results 

 

the company is dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure “it systems” owned and operated by the company or managed by thirdparty service providers suppliers and contract manufacturers it systems enable us to conduct monitor andor protect our business operations systems data and other assets in the ordinary course of our business we and our providers collect process transmit and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary information and that of our customers suppliers and business partners as well as personally identifiable information intrusion into a supplier or contract manufacturer system not integrated with a corning it system could result in service disruption andor loss of financial control 

 

our it systems and those of our providers may be vulnerable to compromise or disruption due to human error or malfeasance outdated applications computer viruses or malware eg ransomware natural disasters unauthorized access cyberattacks and other similar incidents and disruptions increased workfromhome at both the company and our providers presents additional operational risk companies that provide utilities water transportation natural gas and other resources and services across our supply chain are critical to our manufacturing operations and are vulnerable to cyberattacks from time to time both we and certain of our providers have been subject to cyberattacks and security incidents we may be unable to anticipate detect prevent or remediate future attacks particularly as attackers are becoming more sophisticated in their ability to circumvent controls and remove forensic evidence

  

 

any significant disruption breakdown intrusion interruption or corruption data breach or compromise to the accessibility security or integrity of our or our providers’ it systems or the misappropriation or disclosure of any confidential proprietary or personally identifiable information could result in the loss of data or intellectual property equipment or systems damage downtime safety related issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business including by harming our competitive position and reputation disrupting our manufacturing reducing the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives impairing our ability to access suppliers contract manufacturers customers and cloudbased services subjecting us to litigation or regulatory investigations or fines increasing the costs of compliance and remediation or otherwise adversely affecting our business  we may be required to invest significant additional resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to modify and enhance our it systems information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities any losses costs or liabilities may not be covered by or may exceed the coverage limits of any or all of our applicable insurance policies 

 

we may not earn a positive return from our research development and engineering investments 

 

developing our products through our innovation model of research and development is costly and often involves a long investment cycle we make significant investments in research development and engineering that may not earn an economic return if our investments do not provide a pipeline of products or technologies that our customers demand or lower our manufacturing costs it could negatively impact our revenue and operating margins for both near and longterm

 

our innovation model depends on our ability to attract and retain specialized experts in our core technologies 

 

our innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science ceramic science and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities the loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering team without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance

 

we are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations 

 

some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste wastewater other industrial waste or greenhouse gases and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of such substances we have installed antipollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and wastewater at our facilities we have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations however we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards

 

any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us or the suspensioncessation of production or operations in addition environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

 

changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the us and other countries such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and co 2 abatement may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by among other things substantially increasing manufacturing costs limiting availability of scarce resources especially energy or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers

 

 

general risk factors 

 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain  judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes  although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax assessments audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals or result in the forfeiture of funds deposited with the relevant government authorities  the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which such a determination is made 

 

the us other countries and international organizations such as organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” may change their laws or issue new international tax standards that may also impact our taxes 

 

as a global company we face many risks which could adversely impact our operations and financial results 

 

we are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenue from and have significant operations outside of the us our international operations include manufacturing assembly sales research and development customer support and shared administrative service centers additionally we rely on a global supply chain for key components and capabilities that are central to our ability to invent make and sell products

 

compliance with laws and regulations increases our costs we are subject to both us laws and the local laws where we operate which among other things include data privacy requirements employment and labor laws tax laws anticompetition regulations prohibitions on payments to governmental officials import and trade restrictions and export requirements noncompliance or violations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our businesses and operating results our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks

 

corning is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain and inflationary global economy 

 

uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions including uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets national debt fiscal or monetary concerns inflation and rising interest rates in various regions could materially adversely impact corning’s operating results markets for our products depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for network capacity electronics and automotive products uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions that result in decreases in consumer spending and demand or cause us to pass on increased costs to our customers may cause certain of our customers to push out cancel or refrain from purchasing our products which could materially adversely impact demand for our products and our operating results in addition the covid19 pandemic and transportation interruptions and other measures taken in response thereto have had and may continue to have a significant adverse impact on the global and regional economic activity as well as our ability to meet our customer demand

 

similarly changes that result in sudden increases in consumer demand for electronic products have resulted in and may continue to result in a shortage of parts and materials needed to manufacture our products or the products in which our products are used such shortages as well as shipment delays due to transportation interruptions have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our ability to meet our demand requirements

 

uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for corning to forecast its operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations if corning does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues corning must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings

 

 

we are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization including those related to

 

               

we have significant exposure to foreign currency movements 

 

a large portion of our sales profit and cash flows are transacted in nonus dollar currencies the company expects to continue to experience fluctuations in the us dollar value of these activities if it is not possible costeffective or should we not elect to hedge certain currency exposure additionally gains or losses may be experienced if the underlying exposure which has been hedged increases or decreases significantly

 

the ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposure that we have the changes in exchange rates associated with those exposures whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors 

 

these factors which are variable and generally outside of our control could materially impact our results of operations anticipated future results financial position and cash flows

 

we may have significant exposure to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio 

 

we maintain a significant portfolio of over the counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency exposure we are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows

 

current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations 

 

as a global technology and manufacturing company we are engaged in various litigation and regulatory matters litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain and adverse rulings could occur resulting in significant liabilities penalties or damages any such substantial legal liability or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation

 

 

our business is subject to various governmental regulations and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribution of certain products and we could be subject to administrative proceedings and civil or criminal penalties 

 

our products and operations are also subject to regulation by us and non‐us regulatory agencies such as the us federal trade commission “ftc” from time to time we may also be involved or required to participate in regulatory investigations or inquiries into certain of our contracting and business practices which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceedings growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations is likely to result in increased anti‐competition legislation regulation administrative rule making and enforcement activity involvement in regulatory investigations or inquiries can be costly lengthy complex and time consuming diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel if any pending or future governmental investigations result in an unfavorable resolution we could be required to cease the manufacture and sale of the subject products or technology pay fines or disgorge profits or other payments andor cease certain conduct andor modify our contracting or business practices which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired in connection with regulatory investigations these liabilities could be substantial and may include among other things the cost of government law enforcement or regulatory investigations and civil or criminal fines and penalties

 

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

 

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violation by an employee or the company may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the us we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject to based on the way existing laws might be administered or interpreted

 

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials to obtain or retain business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our continued operation and expansion outside the us including in developing countries could increase the risk of alleged violations violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition

 

moreover several of our key customers are domiciled in areas of the world with laws rules and business practices that may notably differ from those in the us and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws rules and business practices

 

international trade policies may negatively impact our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the us 

 

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas tariffs and capital controls whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us our equity affiliates or joint ventures from being able to sell and manufacture products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry together with antidumping claims duties slowed regulatory approvals and other restrictions in countries in which we import raw materials and components or sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations

core performance measures 

 

in managing the company and assessing our financial performance we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to report core performance measures these items include gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts acquisitionrelated costs certain discrete tax items and other taxrelated adjustments restructuring impairment losses and other charges and credits certain litigationrelated expenses pension marktomarket adjustments and other items which do not reflect ongoing operating results of the company or our equity affiliates corning utilizes constantcurrency reporting for our display technologies environmental technologies specialty materials and life sciences segments for the japanese yen south korean won chinese yuan new taiwan dollar and the euro the company believes that the use of constantcurrency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows corning also believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions

 

core performance measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “gaap” we believe investors should consider these nongaap measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends these measures are not and should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap reporting measures with respect to the company’s outlook for future periods it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these nongaap measures because the company does not forecast the movement of foreign currencies against the us dollar or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations nor does it forecast items that 

have not yet occurred or are out of the company’s control as a result the company is unable to provide outlook information on a gaap basis

critical accounting estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates that required us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates are set forth below

 

 

valuation of the previously held equity interest from the consolidation of hsg 

 

we account for the change in controlling interest using the acquisition method of accounting which requires us to estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities recorded assets recorded include intangible assets such as developed technologies and knowhow tradenames and customerrelated intangibles fixed assets and inventories liabilities recorded include contract liabilities such as customer deposits and deferred revenue debt and other liabilities these assets and liabilities recorded are assessed at the time of the change in control and require judgment in ascertaining the fair values in this business combination achieved in stages we also remeasure the previously held equity interest in hsg at the time of the change in control at fair value and recognize the resulting gain in earnings independent appraisals assisted the company in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities such appraisals are based on acceptable valuation models as well as inputs and assumptions provided by us additional information related to the fair value of the assets and liabilities recorded during the allocation period not to exceed one year may result in changes to the recorded values of assets and liabilities resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business combination changes in assumptions and estimates after completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired as well as differences in actual and estimated results could result in impacts to corning’s financial results

 

in september 2020 hsg redeemed dupont’s entire ownership interest in hsg for 250 million the redemption upon completion of the redemption corning recognized a pretax gain of 498 million on its previously held equity investment in hsg as a result of the consolidation resulting from the redemption the gain was calculated based on the difference between fair value and carrying value of the equity method investment immediately preceding the redemption the fair value of corning’s equity interest in hsg was estimated by applying the income approach which was based on significant assumptions such as projected revenue and discount rate the company used a discount rate of 165 and terminal growth rate of zero

 

upon completion of the redemption we recognized intangible assets consisting primarily of 215 million of developed technologies and knowhow and 70 million of other intangibles that are amortized over the weighted average useful life of approximately 20 and 15 years respectively the developed technologies and knowhow intangible assets were valued using two appropriate valuation methods the developed technologies and knowhow intangibles assets valued at 125 million utilized the relief from royalty method which was based on significant inputs such as projected revenue and key assumptions including a discount rate of 210 and a royalty rate of 70 the developed technologies and knowhow intangibles assets valued at 90 million utilized the multiperiod excess earnings method under the income approach which was based on significant inputs such as projected revenue and the key assumption of a discount rate of 190

 

valuation of deferred revenue and customer deposits from the consolidation of hsg 

 

upon completion of the redemption and resulting consolidation we recorded a customer deposit liability and deferred revenue

 

corning recorded a customer deposit of 264 million at the fair value of refundable payments that hsg received from a customer under a longterm supply agreement the discount rates used to calculate the present value of the customer deposit range from 254 to 323 the deposits will be repaid from 2029 to 2034 provided that all purchase obligations of this customer under the supply agreement have been satisfied

 

we recorded deferred revenue of 1070 million at fair value related to the performance obligations of nonrefundable consideration previously received by hsg from its customers under long term supply agreements the fair values of deferred revenue were estimated by applying a bottomsup cost buildup method of the cost approach based on significant inputs such as the cost to fulfill the obligations as well as key assumptions including a normal profit margin

 

refer to note 3 investments and note 4 hsg transactions and acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for more information

 

impairment of assets held for use 

 

we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified we review longlived assets in each quarter in which impairment indicators are present we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred

 

 

manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals primarily platinum and rhodium these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of longlived assets this review considers all the company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process in reclamation fabrication or refinement in anticipation of reuse or awaiting use to support increased capacity precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other nonmanufacturing related purposes

 

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include but are not limited to

 

       

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities our assessment is performed at the reportable segment level for most of our reportable segments we concluded that locations or businesses within these segments which share production along the supply chain must be combined to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities

 

for longlived assets when impairment indicators are present we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used assessments also consider changes in asset utilization including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production

 

for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability the estimated fair value of longlived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of longlived assets and considers the fair market value of all precious metals if applicable we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value our estimates are based upon our historical experience our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate

 

at december 31 2021 and 2020 the carrying value of precious metals was 35 billion and 34 billion respectively and significantly lower than the fair market value most of these precious metals are utilized by the display technologies and specialty materials segments the potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments such events include but are not limited to a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our display technologies or specialty materials segments

 

for the year ended december 31 2020 corning incurred a longlived asset impairment and disposal loss for an asset group related to the reassessment and reprioritization of research and development programs within “all other” given the economic environment and market opportunities corning discontinued its investment in these research and development programs the impairment analysis and disposition of certain assets resulted in a total pretax charge of 217 million which was substantially all the carrying value inclusive of an insignificant amount of goodwill the fair value of the asset group for the impairment analysis was measured using unobservable level 3 inputs

 

 

refer to note 2 restructuring impairment and other charges and credits to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on restructuring activities and impairment

 

income taxes 

 

we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environments in which we do business it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances

 

corning accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc topic 740 income taxes which requires that companies only record tax benefits for technical positions that are believed to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement in estimating these amounts we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue an opposing position or alternatively consider a negotiated compromise and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities’ assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position as a result it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates

 

fair value measures 

 

as required corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the company’s own market assumptions once inputs have been characterized we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement in addition observable market data must be used when available and the highestandbestuse measure should be applied to nonfinancial assets corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are shortterm and longterm investments certain pension asset investments and derivatives these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions

 

derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities included in our forward exchange contracts are foreign currency hedges that hedge our cash flow and translation exposure resulting from movements in the japanese yen south korean won euro new taiwan dollar chinese yuan and british pound changes in the fair value of contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings for contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the translated earnings contract gain loss net line of the consolidated statements of income in arriving at the fair value of corning’s derivative assets and liabilities we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction amounts related to credit risk are not material

 

refer to note 16 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

 

probability of litigation outcomes 

 

corning is required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter case law and other casespecific issues see part ii – item 3 legal proceedings for a discussion of corning’s material litigation matters

 

other possible liabilities 

 

the company is required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters including certain tax planning and environmental matters these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals

 

 

pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb 

 

corning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company’s assumptions related to general economic conditions particularly interest rates expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates the cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements mortality turnover and plan participation while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s employee pension and other postretirement obligations and current and future expense

 

costs for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements 1 ongoing costs recognized quarterly which are comprised of service and interest costs expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs and 2 marktomarket gains and losses outside of the corridor where the corridor is equal to 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets at the beginning of the year which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year these gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets any interim remeasurement such as curtailments settlements significant plan changes or adjustments to the annual valuation is recognized as a marktomarket adjustment in the quarter in which such an event occurs

 

costs for opeb plans consist of ongoing costs recognized quarterly and are comprised of service and interest costs amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses we recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor

 

the following table presents our actual and expected return on assets as well as the corresponding percentages

 

  

as of december 31 2021 the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was 41 billion

 

the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans

 

  

the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning’s funding requirements

 

 

in addition at december 31 2021 a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would decrease shareholders’ equity by 137 million before tax and a 25 basis point increase in each spot rate would increase shareholders’ equity by 129 million in addition the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate

 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in each spot rate assumption related to corning’s us opeb plans

 

  

  

the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear

 

revenue recognition 

 

the company recognizes revenue when all performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied and control of the product has been transferred to the customer if customer acceptance clauses are present and it cannot be objectively determined that control has been transferred revenue is only recorded when customer acceptance is received and all performance obligations have been satisfied sales of goods typically do not include multiple product andor service elements corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue over time the performance obligations under these contracts generally require services to be performed over time resulting in either a straightline amortization method or an input method using incurred and forecasted expense to predict revenue recognition patterns which follows satisfaction of the performance obligation

forwardlooking statements 

 

the statements in this annual report on form 10k in reports subsequently filed by corning with the securities and exchange commission sec on form 10q and form 8k and related comments by management that are not historical facts or information and contain words such as “will” “believe” “anticipate” “expect” “intend” “plan” “seek” “see” “would” and “target” and similar expressions are forwardlooking statements such statements relate to future events that by their nature address matters that are to different degrees uncertain these forwardlooking statements relate to among other things the company’s future operating performance the company’s share of new and existing markets the company’s revenue and earnings growth rates the company’s ability to innovate and commercialize new products the companys expected capital expenditure and the company’s implementation of costreduction initiatives and measures to improve pricing including the optimization of the company’s manufacturing capacity

 

although the company believes that these forwardlooking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions regarding among other things current estimates and forecasts general economic conditions its knowledge of its business and key performance indicators that impact the company actual results could differ materially some of the risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to

 

                          

while the company continually reviews trends and uncertainties affecting the companys results of operations and financial condition the company does not assume any obligation to update or supplement any particular forwardlooking statements contained in this document unless required by law

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

 

we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects

 

   

our most significant foreign currency exposure relates to the japanese yen south korean won new taiwan dollar chinese yuan and the euro we seek to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using overthecounter otc derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts in general these hedges expire coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions

 

we are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts however we minimize this risk by maintaining a diverse group of highlyrated major financial institutions as our counterparties we do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments

 

our cash flow hedging activities utilize otc foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers in our net investment hedging activity we use otc foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in certain foreign operations against movements in exchange rates we also use otc foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedged instruments these contracts are used to offset economic currency risks the undesignated hedges limit exposure to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies a significant portion of the company’s nonus revenue is denominated in japanese yen when this revenue is translated back to us dollars the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements in the japanese yen to protect translated earnings against movements in the japanese yen the company has entered into a series of average rate forwards and other derivative instruments

 

we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with foreign currency exposure market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2021 with respect to open foreign exchange forward and option contracts and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 07 billion compared to 10 billion at december 31 2020 specific to the japanese yen a 10 adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 06 billion and 08 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the company expects that these hypothetical losses from a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates on the derivative financial instruments should largely offset gains on the assets liabilities and future transactions being hedged

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in rapidly changing economic political and technological environments that present numerous risks our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows our ability to successfully execute our strategy  growth framework and the trading price of our common stock or debt the following discussion identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with our mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in our forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

risks related to our business 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely impact the global economy and disrupt our operations and supply chains which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

covid19 has impacted and may further impact the global economy and could have additional impacts on economic growth the proper functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates the pandemic has resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures such as travel restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and facility shutdowns these measures have impacted and may continue to impact our workforce and operations and those of our customers contract manufacturers and suppliers particularly in the event of a significant global resurgence of the illness there is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration scope and severity of the pandemic and the impacts on our business and the global economy from the effects of the ongoing pandemic and response measures 

  

corning’s display technologies segment generates a significant amount of the company’s profits and cash flow any significant decrease in display glass pricing or market share could have a material and negative impact on our financial results 

corning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely on the profitability of our display glass business which is subject to continuous pricing pressure due to industry competition potential overcapacity and development of new technologies if we are not able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs and increases in volume to offset ongoing pricing pressure it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

because we have a concentrated customer base in each of our businesses our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or insolvency of one or more key customers as well as our ability to retain these customers 

a relatively small number of end customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in each of our reportable segments this concentration subjects us to a variety of risks including 

 lower sales and cash flow that could result from the loss of one or more of our key customers 

 mergers and consolidations between customers could result in further concentration of corning’s customer base 

 the loss or insolvency of a key customer could result in a substantial loss of sales and reduction in anticipated cash flows and 

 customers may possess substantial leverage in negotiating contractual obligations including liability provisions 

the following table details the number of combined customers of our segments that accounted for a large percentage of segment net sales 



events outside of corning’s control could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers resulting in a negative impact to corning’s net sales net income asset values and liquidity 

disruption to our manufacturing operations could significantly impact corning’s ability to supply its customers and could produce a nearterm severe impact on our individual businesses and the company as a whole given the geographical concentration of certain of our plants the highly engineered nature of our facilities and the globally dispersed talent required to run these facilities any event that adversely affects or restricts movement into or out of a specific geographic area where we our suppliers or our customers have a presence could adversely impact our results due to the specialized nature of the assets and certain singlesite manufacturing locations in the event such a location experiences disruption it may not be possible to find replacement capacity or substitute production from other facilities 

  

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights which could result in loss of market share and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on patent and trade secret laws copyright trademark confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses we cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of or the unauthorized use of our intellectual property potentially resulting in loss of market share litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are unpredictable if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive 

the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios we periodically receive notices from or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights andor breach of our agreements with them these third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design manufacture or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us 

information technology dependency and cyber security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue liability claims or competitive harm 

the company is dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure including cloudbased services “it systems” to conduct its business our it systems may be vulnerable to disruptions from human error outdated applications computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized access cyberattack and other similar disruptions we have measures and defenses in place against such events but we may not be able to prevent immediately detect or remediate all instances of such events any significant disruption breakdown intrusion interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could cause the loss of data or intellectual property equipment damage downtime andor safety related issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business a material security breach or disruption of our it systems could result in theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information harm our competitive position disrupt our manufacturing reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives impair our ability to access vendors suppliers and cloudbased services or otherwise adversely affect our business 

additionally we believe that utilities and other operators of critical infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks including cyberattack in the event of such an attack disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power electrical gas etc 

we may not earn a positive return from our research development and engineering investments 

developing our products through our innovation model of research and development is expensive and often involves a long investment cycle we make significant expenditures and investments in research development and engineering that may not earn an economic return if our investments do not provide a pipeline of products or technologies that our customers demand or lower our manufacturing costs it could negatively impact our revenue and operating margins both near and longterm 

  

if we are unable to obtain certain specialized equipment raw and batch materials or natural resources required in our products or processes our business will suffer 

our ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of equipment parts components and raw materials from our suppliers we may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations certain manufacturing equipment components and raw materials are available only from single or limited sources and we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner a reduction interruption or delay of supply or a significant increase in the price for supplies such as manufacturing equipment precious metals raw materials utilities including energy and industrial water could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

we use specialized raw materials from singlesource suppliers eg specific mines or quarries and natural resources eg helium in certain products and processes if a supplier is unable to provide the required raw materials or the natural resource is in scarce supply or not readily available we may be unable to change our product composition or manufacturing process to prevent disruption to our business 

our innovation model depends on our ability to attract and retain specialized experts in our core technologies 

our innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science ceramic science and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities the loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering team without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance 

we are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations 

some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste waste water other industrial waste or greenhouse gases and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of such substances we have installed antipollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities we have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations however we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards 

any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us or the suspensioncessation of production or operations in addition environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the us and other countries such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and co 2 abatement may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by among other things substantially increasing manufacturing costs limiting availability of scarce resources especially energy or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers 

general risk factors 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

  

the 2017 tax act significantly impacted how us global corporations are taxed significant guidance has been issued with the intention of clarifying the new tax provisions to date some of the regulations had been finalized and clarified but a considerable amount of this guidance is still in the form of proposed regulations due to the volume and complexity of both the final and proposed regulations we continue to evaluate any development and impact of the 2017 tax act that could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow in addition to the 2017 tax act other foreign countries and international organizations such as organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” may have law changes and issue new international tax standards that may also impact our taxes 

as a global company we face many risks which could adversely impact our operations and financial results 

we are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenue from and have significant operations outside of the united states our international operations include manufacturing assembly sales research and development customer support and shared administrative service centers additionally we rely on a global supply chain for key components and capabilities that are central to our ability to invent make and sell products 

compliance with laws and regulations increases our costs we are subject to both us laws and the local laws where we operate which among other things include data privacy requirements employment and labor laws tax laws anticompetition regulations prohibitions on payments to governmental officials import and trade restrictions and export requirements noncompliance or violations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and operating results our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks 

we are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization including those related to 

 the economic and political conditions in each country or region and among countries 

 complex regulatory requirements affecting international trade and investment including antidumping laws export controls the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting improper payments our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the substance or enforcement of these regulatory requirements and by actual or alleged violations of them 

 fluctuations in currency exchange rates convertibility of currencies and restrictions involving the movement of funds between jurisdictions and countries 

 governmental protectionist policies and sovereign and political risks that may adversely affect corning’s profitability and assets 

 tariffs trade duties and other trade barriers including antidumping duties 

 geographical concentration of our factories and operations and regional shifts in our customer base 

 periodic health epidemic concerns 

 political unrest confiscation or expropriation of assets by foreign governments terrorism and the potential for other hostilities 

 difficulty in protecting intellectual property sensitive commercial and operations data and information technology systems 

 differing legal systems including protection and treatment of intellectual property and patents 

 complex changing or competing tax regimes 

 difficulty in collecting obligations owed to us 

 natural disasters such as floods earthquakes tsunamis and windstorms and 

 potential loss of utilities or other disruption affecting manufacturing 

  

we have significant exposure to foreign currency movements 

a large portion of our sales profit and cash flows are transacted in nonus dollar currencies the company expects to continue to experience fluctuations in the us dollar value of these activities if it is not possible costeffective or should we not elect to hedge certain currency exposure additionally gains or losses may be experienced if the underlying exposure which has been hedged increases or decreases significantly 

the ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposure that we have the changes in exchange rates associated with those exposures whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors 

foreign currency movements may impact our competitive cost position relative to our largest japanbased competitors in the display technologies segment the profitability of customers may also be impacted as they typically purchase from us in japanese yen and sell in various currencies 

these factors which are variable and generally outside of our control could materially impact our results of operations anticipated future results financial position and cash flows 

we may have significant exposure to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio 

we maintain a significant portfolio of over the counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency and periodically may utilize interest rate derivatives equity derivatives and commodities we are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations 

as a global technology and manufacturing company we are engaged in various litigation and regulatory matters litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain and adverse rulings could occur resulting in significant liabilities penalties or damages any such substantial legal liability or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violation by an employee or the company may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the way existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials to obtain or retain business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our continued operation and expansion outside the united states including in developing countries could increase the risk of alleged violations violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

  

moreover several of our key customers are domiciled in areas of the world with laws rules and business practices that may notably differ from those in the united states and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws rules and business practices 

international trade policies may negatively impact our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the us 

  

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas tariffs and capital controls whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us our equity affiliates or joint ventures from being able to sell and manufacture products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations

2020 results 

net sales in the year ended december 31 2020 were 113 billion a net decrease of 200 million or 2 when compared to the year ended december 31 2019 driven by lower sales in the display technologies optical communications environmental technologies and life sciences segments partially offset by higher sales the specialty materials segment and “all other” 

for the year ended december 31 2020 we generated net income of 512 million or 054 per share compared to a net income of 960 million or 107 per share for 2019 when compared to 2019 the 448 million decrease in net income was primarily due to the following items amounts presented after tax 

 the negative impact of marktomarket translated earnings contract losses of 226 million 

 higher costs of 170 million for an asset impairment loss related to investments in research and development programs within “all other” 

 higher costs for litigation and environmental reserves of 133 million 

 higher expenses of 117 million primarily driven by severance costs for the display technologies segment 

 the negative impact of a cumulative adjustment recorded during the first quarter of 2020 to reduce revenue in the amount of 105 million the adjustment was associated with a previously recorded commercial benefit asset reflected as a prepayment to a customer with a longterm supply agreement that is exiting its production of lcd panels and 

 lower segment net income of 73 million mainly driven by lower volumes in the first half of 2020 

partially offsetting these events were the following items 

 gain on a previously held equity investment in hsg of 387 million and 

 an 83 million gain recognized from the initial public offering of an investment in the fourth quarter of 2020  

diluted earnings per share decreased in 2020 by 053 per share or 50 when compared to 2019 primarily driven by the decrease in net income describ ed above the impact of share repurchases did not materially impact the change in diluted earnings per share 

the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including the impact of hedges realized in the current year positively impacted corning’s net income by approximately 51 million in the year ended december 31 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019 

2021 corporate outlook 

we believe 2021 will be a year of growth and we will continue to focus on operational excellence cashflow generation and prudent capital allocation we expect yearoveryear sales growth to accelerate in the first quarter of 2021 with approximately 30  32 billion of net sales

translated earnings contract loss gain net 

included in the line item translated earnings contract loss gain net is the impact of foreign currency contracts which hedge our translation exposure arising from movements in the japanese yen south korean won new taiwan dollar euro chinese yuan and british pound and its impact on our net income 

the following table provides detailed information on the impact of our translated earnings contracts gains and losses for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



1 includes pretax realized losses related to the expiration of option contracts for the year ended 2020 2019 2018 of 20 million 37 million and 11 million respectively and was reflected in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows

income before income taxes 

the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including the impact of hedges realized in the current year positively impacted corning’s income before income taxes by 60 million in the year ended december 31 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows dollars in millions 



for the year ended december 31 2020 the effective income tax rate differed from the us statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the following 

 additional net provision of 73 million from changes to our tax reserves 

 a net provision of 45 million due primarily to stronger foreign earnings relative to us earnings in the current year as well as us income inclusion under the internal revenue code “subpart f income” and 

 a net benefit of 116 million due to a net operating loss carryback allowed under the cares act 

‎ 

  

for the year ended december 31 2019 the effective income tax rate differed from the us statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the following 

 additional net provision of 102 million from changes to our tax reserves 

 a net benefit of 45 million due to releases of foreign valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets that are now considered realizable and 

 additional net benefit including a change in estimate from prior year from the 2017 tax act attributable to foreign intangible income fdii deduction of 103 million offset by taxes for global intangible lowtaxed income gilti of 15 million 

generally corning will indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings of 1 any of its subsidiaries located in jurisdictions where corning lacks the ability to repatriate its earnings 2 any of its subsidiaries where corning’s intention is to reinvest those earnings in operations 3 legal entities for which corning holds a noncontrolling interest 4 any subsidiaries with an accumulated deficit in earnings and profits 5 any subsidiaries which have a positive earnings and profits balance but for which the entity lacks sufficient local statutory earnings or stock basis from which to make a distribution or 6 any of its subsidiaries where a future distribution would trigger a significant net cost to the us shareholder 

during 2020 the company distributed approximately 914 million from foreign subsidiaries to their respective us parent companies as of december 31 2020 corning has approximately 2 billion of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings it remains impracticable to calculate the tax cost of repatriating our unremitted earnings which are considered indefinitely reinvested

this gain was partially offset by the following 

 a decrease in net income of 448 million and

core performance measures 

in managing the company and assessing our financial performance we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to report core performance measures these items include gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts acquisitionrelated costs certain discrete tax items and other taxrelated adjustments restructuring impairment losses and other charges and credits certain litigationrelated expenses pension marktomarket adjustments and other items which do not reflect ongoing operating results of the company or our equity affiliates corning utilizes constantcurrency reporting for our display technologies environmental technologies specialty materials and life sciences segments for the japanese yen south korean won chinese yuan new taiwan dollar and the euro effective january 1 2019 corning began using constantcurrency reporting for our environmental technologies and life sciences segments  the company believes that the use of constantcurrency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows corning also believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions 

core performance measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” we believe investors should consider these nongaap measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends these measures are not and should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap reporting measures with respect to the company’s outlook for future periods it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these nongaap measures because the company does not forecast the movement of foreign currencies against the us dollar or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the company’s control as a result the company is unable to provide outlook information on a gaap basis 

  

effective july 1 2019 we replaced the term “core earnings” with “core net income”  the terms are interchangeable and the underlying calculations remain the same

in the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 customer deposits used were 140 million and 37 million respectively as of december 31 2020 and 2019 1148 million and 927 million were recorded as other longterm liabilities respectively the remaining 211 million and 104 million respectively were classified as other current liabilities

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates that required us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates are set forth below 

valuation of the previously held equity interest from the consolidation of hsg 

we account for the change in controlling interest using the acquisition method of accounting which requires us to estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities recorded assets recorded include intangible assets such as developed technologies and knowhow tradenames and customerrelated intangibles fixed assets and inventories liabilities recorded include contract liabilities such as customer deposits and deferred revenue debt and other liabilities these assets and liabilities recorded are assessed at the time of the change in control and require judgment in ascertaining the fair values in this business combination achieved in stages we also remeasure the previously held equity interest in hsg at the time of the change in control at fair value and recognize the resulting gain in earnings independent appraisals assisted the company in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities such appraisals are based on acceptable valuation models as well as inputs and assumptions provided by us additional information related to the fair value of the assets and liabilities recorded during the allocation period not to exceed one year may result in changes to the recorded values of assets and liabilities resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business combination changes in assumptions and estimates after completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired as well as differences in actual and estimated results could result in impacts to corning’s financial results 

in september 2020 hsg redeemed dupont’s entire ownership interest in hsg for 250 million upon completion of the redemption corning recognized a pretax gain of 498 million on its previously held equity investment in hsg as a result of the consolidation resulting from the redemption the gain was calculated based on the difference between fair value and carrying value of the equity method investment immediately preceding the redemption the fair value of corning’s equity interest in hsg was estimated by applying the income approach which was based on significant assumptions such as projected revenue and discount rate the company used a discount rate of 165 and terminal growth rate of zero 

upon completion of the redemption we recognized intangible assets consisting primarily of 215 million of developed technologies and knowhow and 70 million of other intangibles that are amortized over the weighted average useful life of approximately 20 and 15 years respectively the developed technologies and knowhow intangible assets were valued using two appropriate valuation methods the developed technologies and knowhow intangibles asset valued at 125 million utilized the relief from royalty method which was based on significant inputs such as projected revenue and key assumptions including a discount rate of 210 and a royalty rate of 70 the developed technologies and knowhow intangibles asset valued at 90 million utilized the multiperiod excess earnings method under the income approach which was based on significant inputs such as projected revenue and the key assumption of a discount rate of 190 

valuation of deferred revenue and customer deposits from the consolidation of hsg 

upon completion of the redemption and resulting consolidation we recorded a customer deposit liability and deferred revenue 

corning recorded a customer deposit of 264 million at the fair value of refundable payments that hsg received from a customer under a longterm supply agreement the discount rates used to calculate the present value of the customer deposit range from 254 to 323 the deposits will be repaid from 2029 to 2034 provided that all purchase obligations of this customer under the supply agreement have been satisfied 

  

we recorded deferred revenue of 1070 million at fair value related to the performance obligations of nonrefundable consideration previously received by hsg from its customers under long term supply agreements the fair values of deferred revenue were estimated by applying a bottomsup cost buildup method of the cost approach based on significant inputs such as the cost to fulfill the obligations as well as key assumptions including a normal profit margin

we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified we review longlived assets in each quarter in which impairment indicators are present we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 

manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals primarily platinum and rhodium these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of longlived assets this review considers all the company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process in reclamation fabrication or refinement in anticipation of reuse or awaiting use to support increased capacity precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other nonmanufacturing related purposes 

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include but are not limited to 

 a significant decrease in the market price of an asset 

 a significant change in the use of a longlived or its physical condition 

 a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 

 an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset 

 a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset and 

 a current expectation that more likely than not an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities our assessment is performed at the reportable segment level for the majority of our reportable segments we concluded that locations or businesses within these segments which share production along the supply chain must be combined to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

for longlived assets when impairment indicators are present we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used assessments also consider changes in asset utilization including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production 

  

for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability the estimated fair value of longlived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of longlived assets and considers the fair market value of all precious metals if applicable we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value our estimates are based upon our historical experience our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

at december 31 2020 and 2019 the carrying value of precious metals was 34 billion and 33 billion respectively and significantly lower than the fair market value most of these precious metals are utilized by the display technologies and specialty materials segments corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments the potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments such events include but are not limited to a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our display technologies or specialty materials segments 

for the year ended december 31 2020 corning incurred a longlived asset impairment and disposal loss for an asset group related to the reassessment and reprioritization of research and development programs within “all other” given the economic environment and market opportunities corning discontinued its investment in these research and development programs the impairment analysis and disposition of certain assets resulted in a total pretax charge of 217 million which was substantially all the carrying value inclusive of an insignificant amount of goodwill the fair value of the asset group for the impairment analysis was measured using unobservable level 3 inputs 

refer to note 2 restructuring impairment and other charges and credits to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on restructuring activities and impairment 

income taxes 

we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environments in which we do business it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances 

corning accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc topic 740 income taxes which requires that companies only record tax benefits for technical positions that are believed to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement in estimating these amounts we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue an opposing position or alternatively consider a negotiated compromise and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities’ assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position as a result it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates 

  

fair value measures 

as required corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the company’s own market assumptions once inputs have been characterized we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement in addition observable market data must be used when available and the highestandbestuse measure should be applied to nonfinancial assets corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are shortterm and longterm investments certain pension asset investments and derivatives these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions 

derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities included in our forward exchange contracts are foreign currency hedges that hedge our cash flow and translation exposure resulting from movements in the japanese yen south korean won euro new taiwan dollar chinese yuan and british pound changes in the fair value of contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings for contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the translated earnings contract loss gain net line of the consolidated statements of income in arriving at the fair value of corning’s derivative assets and liabilities we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction amounts related to credit risk are not material 

refer to note 16 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

probability of litigation outcomes 

corning is required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter case law and other casespecific issues see part ii – item 3 legal proceedings for a discussion of corning’s material litigation matters 

other possible liabilities 

the company is required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters including certain tax planning and environmental matters these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 

pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb 

corning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company’s assumptions related to general economic conditions particularly interest rates expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates the cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements mortality turnover and plan participation while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s employee pension and other postretirement obligations and current and future expense 

  

costs for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements 1 ongoing costs recognized quarterly which are comprised of service and interest costs expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs and 2 marktomarket gains and losses outside of the corridor where the corridor is equal to 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets at the beginning of the year which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year these gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets any interim remeasurement such as curtailments settlements significant plan changes or adjustments to the annual valuation is recognized as a marktomarket adjustment in the quarter in which such an event occurs 

costs for opeb plans consist of ongoing costs recognized quarterly and are comprised of service and interest costs amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses we recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor 

the following table presents our actual and expected return on assets as well as the corresponding percentages 



as of december 31 2020 the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was 42 billion 

the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans 



the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning’s funding requirements 

in addition at december 31 2020 a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would decrease shareholders’ equity by 148 million before tax and a 25 basis point increase in each spot rate would increase shareholders’ equity by 140 million in addition the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate 

  

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in each spot rate assumption related to corning’s us opeb plans 



 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo 

the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when all performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied and control of the product has been transferred to the customer if customer acceptance clauses are present and it cannot be objectively determined that control has been transferred revenue is only recorded when customer acceptance is received and all performance obligations have been satisfied sales of goods typically do not include multiple product andor service elements corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue over time the performance obligations under these contracts generally require services to be performed over time resulting in either a straightline amortization method or an input method using incurred and forecasted expense to predict revenue recognition patterns which follows satisfaction of the performance obligation

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects 

 exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings and 

 exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 

our most significant foreign currency exposure relates to the japanese yen south korean won new taiwan dollar chinese yuan and the euro we seek to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using overthecounter otc derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts in general these hedges expire coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions 

we are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts however we minimize this risk by maintaining a diverse group of highlyrated major financial institutions as our counterparties we do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments 

our cash flow hedging activities utilize otc foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers in our net investment hedging activity we use otc foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in certain foreign operations against movements in exchange rates we also use otc foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedged instruments these contracts are used to offset economic currency risks the undesignated hedges limit exposure to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies a significant portion of the company’s nonus revenue are denominated in japanese yen when this revenue is translated back to us dollars the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements in the japanese yen to protect translated earnings against movements in the japanese yen the company has entered into a series of average rate forwards and other derivative instruments 

we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with foreign currency exposure market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2020 with respect to open foreign exchange forward and option contracts and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 10 billion compared to 13 billion at december 31 2019 specific to the japanese yen a 10 adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 08 billion and 10 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the company expects that these hypothetical losses from a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates on the derivative financial instruments should largely offset gains on the assets liabilities and future transactions being hedged

corporate investments 

hemlock semiconductor group “hsg” 

in 2016 corning realigned its ownership interest in dow corning exchanging its 50 interest in the joint venture between corning and dow chemical for a newly formed company that holds a 499 interest in hemlock semiconductor llc and a 4025 interest in hemlock semiconductor operations llc which are recorded as equity method investments of corning and are affiliated companies of hsg hsg manufactures polysilicon products for the semiconductor and solar industries hsg’s solar business primarily serves the solar power panel industry 

in prior years hsg’s solar and semiconductor customers entered into longterm “take or pay” contracts which included upfront cash payments to secure capacity during the last few years and more significantly in 2019 the solar power panel industry experienced significant overcapacity in the market resulting in declining sales volumes and market prices as a result hsg’s solar business experienced lower market penetration overall price declines and settled contracts with customers that had committed volume and fixed pricing above the current market price while

these settlements positively impacted hsg’s cash flow in 2019 they reduced expectations for future sales in hsg’s solar business 

due to the adverse change in hsg’s solar business hsg was required to assess the recoverability of its longlived assets in the fourth quarter based on this assessment hsg determined that the carrying values of hsg’s solar asset group significantly exceeded its fair values hsg engaged a thirdparty appraiser to assist in determining the fair value of the assets within in the solar asset group based on the highest and best use of the asset group as a result of the fair value determination hsg recognized a pretax asset impairment charge of 916 million for the year ended december 31 2019 corning’s share of the pretax impairment was 369 million 

due to the adverse changes above the carrying values of hsg’s solar business inventories were also affected resulting in an inventory writedown of 257 million for the year corning’s pretax share of the provision was 105 million 

hsg adopted the new revenue standard on january 1 2019 and the timing of hsg’s revenue recognition for certain remaining performance obligations measured at january 1 2019 was deferred for recognition this deferral reduced the carrying amount of corning’s investment in hsg by 239 million during the fourth quarter a significant number of the performance obligations were satisfied and 434 million was recognized into hsg’s net income corning’s share of the equity earnings was 208 million 

in addition hsg settled certain revenue contracts in the fourth quarter resulting in settlement gains of 383 million in net income corning’s share of the settlement gains was 185 million

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in rapidly changing economic political and technological environments that present numerous risks our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows our ability to successfully execute our strategy  growth framework and the trading price of our common stock or debt the following discussion identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with our mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in our forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

as a global company we face many risks which could adversely impact our operations and financial results 

we are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from and have significant operations outside of the united states our international operations include manufacturing assembly sales research and development customer support and shared administrative service centers additionally we rely on a global supply chain for key components and capabilities that are central to our ability to invent make and sell products 

compliance with laws and regulations increases our costs we are subject to both us laws and the local laws where we operate which among other things include data privacy requirements employment and labor laws tax laws anticompetition regulations prohibitions on payments to governmental officials import and trade restrictions and export requirements noncompliance or violations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and operating results our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks 

© 2020 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

  

we are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization including those related to 

 the economic and political conditions in each country or region and among countries 

 complex regulatory requirements affecting international trade and investment including antidumping laws export controls the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting improper payments our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the substance or enforcement of these regulatory requirements and by actual or alleged violations of them 

 fluctuations in currency exchange rates convertibility of currencies and restrictions involving the movement of funds between jurisdictions and countries 

 governmental protectionist policies and sovereign and political risks that may adversely affect corning’s profitability and assets 

 tariffs trade duties and other trade barriers including antidumping duties 

 geographical concentration of our factories and operations and regional shifts in our customer base 

 periodic health epidemic concerns 

 political unrest confiscation or expropriation of assets by foreign governments terrorism and the potential for other hostilities 

 difficulty in protecting intellectual property sensitive commercial and operations data and information technology systems 

 differing legal systems including protection and treatment of intellectual property and patents 

 complex changing or competing tax regimes 

 difficulty in collecting obligations owed to us 

 natural disasters such as floods earthquakes tsunamis and windstorms and 

 potential loss of utilities or other disruption affecting manufacturing 

corning’s display technologies segment generates a significant amount of the company’s profits and cash flow any significant decrease in display glass pricing or market share could have a material and negative impact on our financial results 

corning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely on the profitability of our display glass business which is subject to continuous pricing pressure due to industry competition potential overcapacity and development of new technologies if we are not able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs and increases in volume to offset ongoing pricing pressure it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

because we have a concentrated customer base in each of our businesses our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or insolvency of one or more key customers as well as our ability to retain these customers 

a relatively small number of end customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in each of our reportable segments mergers and consolidations between customers could result in further concentration of corning’s customer base further concentration or the loss or insolvency of a key customer could result in a substantial loss of sales and reduction in anticipated in cash flows 

the following table details the number of combined customers of our segments that accounted for a large percentage of segment net sales

business disruptions could affect our operating results 

a major earthquake weather event fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities or our suppliers’ or customers’ facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our financial results could be materially and adversely affected for example certain manufacturing sites require high quality continuous and uninterrupted power and access to industrial water unplanned outages could have a material negative impact on our operations and ability to supply our customers 

we have been closely monitoring the outbreak of the coronavirus that originated in wuhan china we have operations in wuhan and other areas of china we have taken steps to protect our employees and operations the coronavirus may impact the global economy our ability as well as the ability of our customers and suppliers to manufacture products and may reduce demand in our markets which could result in an impact to our financial results we are taking steps to mitigate potential financial impacts including supplying customers from other regions when appropriate currently it is not possible for us to determine the financial impact of the coronavirus if any 

additionally a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our reportable segments is concentrated in singlesite locations due to the specialized nature of the assets in the event such a location experiences disruption it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from other facilities accordingly disruption at a singlesite manufacturing operation could significantly impact corning’s ability to supply its customers and could produce a nearterm severe impact on our individual businesses and the company as a whole 

geopolitical events as well as other events outside of corning’s control could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers resulting in a negative impact to corning’s net sales net income asset values and liquidity 

a natural disaster epidemic labor strike war and social or political unrest in regions where we operate could adversely affect corning’s ability to supply our customers and impact the value of our assets such events may also impact our customers’ facilities and reduce our sales to such customers for example a sizeable portion of corning’s glass manufacturing capacity is in south korea and we generate a significant portion of our sales through two south korean customers deterioration of the geopolitical climate in such a region could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers resulting in a negative impact to corning’s net sales net income asset values and liquidity 

given the geographical concentration of certain of our plants the highly engineered nature of our facilities and the globally dispersed talent required to run these facilities any event that adversely affects or restricts movement into or out of a specific geographic area where we our suppliers or our customers have a presence could adversely impact our results 

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights which could result in loss of market share and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on patent and trade secret laws copyright trademark confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses we cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of or the unauthorized use of our intellectual property potentially resulting in loss of market share litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are unpredictable if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive 

© 2020 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

  

the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios we periodically receive notices from or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights andor breach of our agreements with them these third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design manufacture or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us 

information technology dependency and cyber security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue liability claims or competitive harm 

the company is dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure including cloudbased services “it systems” to conduct its business our it systems may be vulnerable to disruptions from human error outdated applications computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized access cyberattack and other similar disruptions we have measures and defenses in place against such events but we may not be able to prevent immediately detect or remediate all instances of such events any significant disruption breakdown intrusion interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could cause the loss of data or intellectual property equipment damage downtime andor safety related issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business a material security breach or disruption of our it systems could result in theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information harm our competitive position disrupt our manufacturing reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives impair our ability to access vendors suppliers and cloudbased services or otherwise adversely affect our business 

additionally we believe that utilities and other operators of critical infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks including cyberattack in the event of such an attack disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power electrical gas etc 

we may not earn a positive return from our research development and engineering investments 

developing our products through our innovation model of research and development is expensive and often involves a long investment cycle we make significant expenditures and investments in research development and engineering that may not earn an economic return if our investments do not provide a pipeline of products or technologies that our customers demand or lower our manufacturing costs it could negatively impact our revenues and operating margins both near and longterm 

we have significant exposure to foreign currency movements 

a large portion of our sales profit and cash flows are transacted in nonus dollar currencies and we expect that we will continue to experience fluctuations in the us dollar value of these activities if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our currency exposures or should we elect not to hedge certain currency exposures alternatively we may experience gains or losses if the underlying exposure which we have hedged increases or decreases significantly and we are unable to reverse unwind or terminate the hedges concurrent with changes in the underlying notional exposure 

our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we have the exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors 

our hedge portfolio may reduce our ability to respond to price moves by our display technologies segment competitors foreign currency movements may impact our competitive cost position relative to our largest japanbased competitors in the display technologies segment the profitability of customers may also be impacted as they typically purchase from us in japanese yen and sell in various currencies 

© 2020 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

  

these factors which are variable and generally outside of our control could materially impact our results of operations anticipated future results financial position and cash flows 

we may have significant exposure to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio 

we maintain a significant portfolio of over the counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency exposure to the japanese yen new taiwan dollar south korean won chinese yuan and euro we are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we are unable to obtain certain specialized equipment raw and batch materials or natural resources required in our products or processes our business will suffer 

our ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of equipment parts components and raw materials from our suppliers we may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations certain manufacturing equipment components and raw materials are available only from single or limited sources and we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner a reduction interruption or delay of supply or a significant increase in the price for supplies such as manufacturing equipment precious metals raw materials utilities including energy and industrial water could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

we use specialized raw materials from singlesource suppliers eg specific mines or quarries and natural resources eg helium in certain products and processes if a supplier is unable to provide the required raw materials or the natural resource is in scarce supply or not readily available we may be unable to change our product composition or manufacturing process to prevent disruption to our business 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

the 2017 tax act significantly impacted how us global corporations are taxed significant guidance has been issued with the intention of clarifying the new tax provisions to date some of the regulations had been finalized and clarified but a considerable amount of this guidance is still in the form of proposed regulations due to volume and complexity of both of final and proposed regulations we continue to evaluate any development and impact of the 2017 tax act that could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow in addition to the 2017 tax act other foreign countries and international organizations such as organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” may have law changes and issue new international tax standards that may also impact our taxes 

our innovation model depends on our ability to attract and retain specialized experts in our core technologies 

our innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science ceramic science and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities the loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering team without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance

we are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations 

some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste waste water other industrial waste or greenhouse gases and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of such substances we have installed antipollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities we have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations however we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards 

any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us or the suspensioncessation of production or operations in addition environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the us and other countries such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and co 2 abatement may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by among other things substantially increasing manufacturing costs limiting availability of scarce resources especially energy or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers 

current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations 

as a global technology and manufacturing company we are engaged in various litigation and regulatory matters litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain and adverse rulings could occur resulting in significant liabilities penalties or damages any such substantial legal liability or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violation by an employee or the company may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the way existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our continued operation and expansion outside the united states including in developing countries could increase the risk of alleged violations violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

moreover several of our key customers are domiciled in areas of the world with laws rules and business practices that may notably differ from those in the united states and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws rules and business practices

international trade policies may negatively impact our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the us 

  

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas tariffs and capital controls whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us including our equity affiliatesjoint ventures from being able to sell andor manufacture products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations these policies also affect our equity companies

2019 results 

net sales in the year ended december 31 2019 were 115 billion an increase of 213 million or 2 when compared to the year ended december 31 2018 driven by increased sales in the specialty materials environmental technologies and life sciences segments offset by decreased sales in the display technologies and optical communications segments 

for the year ended december 31 2019 we generated net income of 960 million or 107 per share compared to a net income of 1066 million or 113 per share for 2018 when compared to 2018 the 106 million decrease in net income was primarily due to the following items amounts presented after tax 

 lower equity earnings in affiliated companies of 284 million when compared to the prior period primarily driven by asset impairments and an inventory provision partially offset by the deferred revenue recognition associated with adoption of the new revenue standard as well as onetime settlement gains from revenue contracts 

 higher costs of 238 million primarily driven by accelerated depreciation and asset writeoffs for our display technologies and optical communications segments and 

 lower segment net income of 83 million primarily driven by lower sales in our display technologies and optical communications segments 

partially offsetting these events were the following items 

 translated earnings contract gains in the current period were 287 million higher than prior year losses 

 costs related to litigation regulatory and other legal matters were 109 million lower primarily driven by the absence of a 103 million charge related to legal matters recorded in 2018 including a ruling in an intellectual property lawsuit and developments in civil litigation 

 a positive impact of 44 million resulting from a lower marktomarket loss for our defined benefit pension plans and 

 the positive impact of 42 million in tax adjustments primarily relating to the absence of a 172 million irs audit settlement or approximately 40 million of taxes payable after the utilization of tax attributes recorded in the first quarter of 2018 netted against changes in tax reserves changes in foreign valuation allowances and changes in the estimate of 2018 tax expense due to new tax reform guidance 

diluted earnings per share decreased by 006 per share or 5 when compared to 2018 driven by the decrease in net income described above partially offset by the repurchase of 310 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months 

the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including the impact of hedges realized in the current year negatively impacted corning’s net income by approximately 44 million in the year ended december 31 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018 

2020 corporate outlook 

we believe 2020 will be another year of growth in several segments and continued investment in innovations consistent with our strategy  growth framework corning expects its display glass volume to grow by a midsingle digit percentage similar to the midsingle digit percentage growth expected in the display glass market the company expects glass price declines to remain moderate down a midsingle digit percentage for the full year the company expects optical communications fullyear sales to decline by 5 to 10  we expect midsingle digit percentage sales growth in our environmental technologies and life sciences segments we expect highsingle digit percentage sales growth in the specialty materials segment

 net sales in the display technologies segment decreased by 22 million with glass volume up a midsingle digit percentage and lowsingle digit percentage display glass price declines the combination of finished goods volume unfinished glass sold to our equity affiliates and a lowsingledigit percentage price decline resulted in a one percent sales decline 

 optical communications net sales decreased 128 million primarily due to lower sales in carrier products down 199 million partially offset by an increase of 71 million in enterprise network sales 

 specialty materials segment net sales increased by 115 million primarily driven by strong demand for gorilla® glass 

 net sales for environmental technologies increased 210 million primarily driven by sales growth of gasoline particulate filters and 

 life sciences net sales increased by 69 million as sales volume continued to outpace market growth 

movements in foreign exchange rates negatively impacted corning’s consolidated net sales by 45 million in the year ended december 31 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018

 reduced variable compensation expenses of 85 million 

research development and engineering expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2019 research development and engineering expenses increased by 38 million or 4 when compared to the same period in prior year driven by higher costs associated with new product launches and our emerging businesses as a percentage of sales these expenses were consistent when compared to the same period in the previous year 

equity in earnings of affiliated companies 

the following provides a summary of equity earnings losses of affiliated companies in millions 



in 2016 corning realigned its ownership interest in dow corning exchanging its 50 interest in the joint venture between corning and dow chemical for a newly formed company that holds a 499 interest in hemlock semiconductor llc and a 4025 interest in hemlock semiconductor operations llc which are recorded as equity method investments of corning and are affiliated companies of hsg hsg manufactures polysilicon products for the semiconductor and solar industries hsg’s solar business primarily serves the solar power panel industry 

in prior years hsg’s solar and semiconductor customers entered into longterm “take or pay” contracts which included upfront cash payments to secure capacity during the last few years and more significantly in 2019 the solar power panel industry experienced significant overcapacity in the market resulting in declining sales volumes and market prices as a result hsg’s solar business experienced lower market penetration overall price declines and settled contracts with customers that had committed volume and fixed pricing above the current market price while these settlements positively impacted hsg’s cash flow in 2019 they reduced expectations for future sales in hsg’s solar business 

due to the adverse change in hsg’s solar business hsg was required to assess the recoverability of its longlived assets in the fourth quarter based on this assessment hsg determined that the carrying values of hsg’s solar asset group significantly exceeded its fair values hsg engaged a thirdparty appraiser to assist in determining the fair value of the assets within in the solar asset group based on the highest and best use of the asset group as a result of the fair value determination hsg recognized a pretax asset impairment charge of 916 million for the year ended december 31 2019 corning’s share of the pretax impairment was 369 million 

due to the adverse changes above the carrying values of hsg’s solar business inventories were also affected resulting in an inventory writedown of 257 million for the year corning’s pretax share of the provision was 105 million 

© 2020 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

  

hsg adopted the new revenue standard on january 1 2019 and the timing of hsg’s revenue recognition for certain remaining performance obligations measured at january 1 2019 was deferred for recognition this deferral reduced the carrying amount of corning’s investment in hsg by 239 million during the fourth quarter a significant number of the performance obligations were satisfied and 434 million was recognized into hsg’s net income corning’s share of the equity earnings was 208 million 

in addition hsg settled certain revenue contracts in the fourth quarter resulting in settlement gains of 383 million in net income corning’s share of the settlement gains was 185 million 

additional information about corporate investments is presented in note 6 investments to the consolidated financial statements 

translated earnings contracts 

included in the line item translated earnings contract gain loss net is the impact of foreign currency hedges which hedge our translation exposure arising from movements in the japanese yen south korean won new taiwan dollar euro chinese yuan and british pound and its impact on our net income loss 

the following table provides detailed information on the impact of our translated earnings contracts gains and losses for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017

the gross notional value outstanding on our translated earnings contracts and foreign currency cash flow hedges were as follows in billions 



income before income taxes 

the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including the impact of hedges realized in the current year negatively impacted corning’s income before income taxes by 39 million in the year ended december 31 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows dollars in millions 



for the year ended december 31 2019 the effective income tax rate differed from the us statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the following 

 additional net provision of 102 million from changes to our tax reserves 

 a net benefit of 45 million due to releases of foreign valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets that are now considered realizable and 

 additional net benefit including a change in estimate from prior year from the 2017 tax act attributable to foreign intangible income fdii deduction of 103 million offset by taxes for global intangible lowtaxed income gilti of 15 million 

for the year ended december 31 2018 the effective income tax rate differed from the us statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the following 

 additional taxes of 55 million related primarily to the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” provisions of the 2017 tax act and 

 incremental tax expense of 172 million related to a preliminary agreement with the irs for the income tax audit of years 2013 and 2014 

© 2020 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

  

these items were partially offset by the following 

 a benefit of 35 million related to the finalization of the onetime toll charge recorded in 2017 and 

 an 82 million benefit from the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are now considered realizable 

generally corning will indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings of 1 any of its subsidiaries located in jurisdictions where corning lacks the ability to repatriate its earnings 2 any of its subsidiaries where corning’s intention is to reinvest those earnings in operations 3 legal entities for which corning holds a noncontrolling interest 4 any subsidiaries with an accumulated deficit in earnings and profits 5 any subsidiaries which have a positive earnings and profits balance but for which the entity lacks sufficient local statutory earnings or stock basis from which to make a distribution and 6 future distribution would trigger a significant federal income inclusion to the us shareholder 

during 2019 the company distributed approximately 424 million from foreign subsidiaries to their respective us parent companies as of december 31 2019 corning has approximately 25 billion of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings it remains impracticable to calculate the tax cost of repatriating our unremitted earnings which are considered indefinitely reinvested

comprehensive income 



2019 vs 2018 

for the year ended december 31 2019 comprehensive income decreased by 99 million when compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to the following 

 a decrease in net income of 106 million and 

 an 83 million increase in unamortized actuarial losses for postretirement benefit plans 53 million of which was related to the adoption of the new standard for reclassification of stranded tax effects in aoci with the remainder of the impact driven by decreases in the discount rates used to value our postretirement obligations 

these losses were partially offset by the following 

 a decrease in the loss on foreign currency translation adjustments in the amount of 42 million most significantly impacted by the chinese yuan south korean won and japanese yen and 

 the impact of a change to net unrealized gains on designated hedges of 46 million

core performance measures 

in managing the company and assessing our financial performance we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to report core performance measures these items include gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts acquisitionrelated costs certain discrete tax items and other taxrelated adjustments restructuring impairment and other charges or credits certain litigationrelated expenses pension marktomarket adjustments and other items which do not reflect ongoing operating results of the company or our equity affiliates corning utilizes constantcurrency reporting for our display technologies and specialty materials segments for the japanese yen south korean won chinese yuan and new taiwan dollar currencies effective january 1 2019 corning also began using constantcurrency reporting for our environmental technologies and life sciences segments for the euro japanese yen and chinese yuan the company believes that the use of constantcurrency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows corning also believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions 

core performance measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” we believe investors should consider these nongaap measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends these measures are not and should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap reporting measures with respect to the company’s outlook for future periods it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these nongaap measures because the company does not forecast the movement of foreign currencies against the us dollar or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the company’s control as a result the company is unable to provide outlook information on a gaap basis 

effective july 1 2019 we replaced the term “core earnings” with “core net income”  the terms are interchangeable and the underlying calculations remain the same

core net income 

2019 vs 2018 

in the year ended december 31 2019 we generated core net income of 1578 million or 176 per share compared to core net income generated in the year ended december 31 2018 of 1673 million or 178 per share the decrease in core net income of 95 million was driven by the following items 

 a decrease in the optical communications segment of 103 million primarily driven by decreases in volume 

 a decrease in the display technologies segment of 49 million primarily driven by decreases in volume and glass shipments during the second half of 2019 resulting in lower factory utilization and negatively impacting profitability and 

 a decrease of 11 million in the specialty materials segment largely driven by the absence of customer support for new product development costs for the launch of new product innovations in 2019 

partially offsetting these decreases in core net income were the following 

 an increase in the environmental technologies segment of 55 million resulting from earnings growth driven by increased sales of gas particulate filters and 

 an increase of 33 million in the life sciences segment resulting from higher volumes outpacing the underlying market 

core earnings per share decreased in the year ended december 31 2019 to 176 per share driven by the decrease in core net income and partially offset by the repurchase of 310 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months 

included in core net income for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 is net periodic pension expense in the amount of 84 million 52 million and 49 million which excludes the annual pension marktomarket adjustments

reconciliation of nongaap measures 

we utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with gaap to assess our financial and operating performance a nongaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that i excludes amounts or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the consolidated statements of income loss or statement of cash flows or ii includes amounts or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the consolidated statements of income loss or statement of cash flows 

core net sales core equity in earnings of affiliated companies and core net income are nongaap financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the company’s operations

all other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “all other” this group is primarily comprised of the results of pharmaceutical technologies auto glass new product lines and development projects as well as certain corporate investments 

we prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis consistent with our internal disaggregation of financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions we use a segment tax rate of 21 when presenting segment information the impact of changes in the japanese yen euro south korean won chinese yuan and new taiwan dollar are excluded from segment sales and segment net income for the display technologies specialty materials environmental technologies and life science segments certain corporate income and expenses are included in the unallocated amounts in the reconciliation of reportable segment net income to consolidated net income these include items that are not used by our codm in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments and include the following items the impact of our translated earnings contracts acquisitionrelated costs discrete tax items and other taxrelated adjustments certain litigation regulatory and other legal matters restructuring impairment and other charges or credits adjustments relating to acquisitions and other nonrecurring nonoperational items although we exclude these amounts from segment results they are included in reported consolidated results 

we included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment’s net income we have allocated certain common expenses among reportable segments differently than we would for standalone financial information segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies 

display technologies 

the following table provides net sales and net income for the display technologies segment 



2019 vs 2018 

net sales in the display technologies segment decreased by 22 million or 1 for the year ended december 31 2019 when compared to the prior year corning’s glass volume increased by a midsingle digit percentage higher than the overall market driven by increased gen 105 output during the year the combination of finished goods volume unfinished glass sold to our equity affiliates and a lowsingledigit percentage price decline resulted in a one percent sales decline

net income in the display technologies segment decreased by 49 million in the year ended december 31 2019 driven by the decrease in sales outlined above display technologies shipped more glass in the first half of 2019 than in the latter half due to lower glass volumes in the second half of 2019 factory utilization declined impacting profitability 

outlook 

for fullyear 2020 corning expects its display glass volume to grow by a midsingle digit percentage similar to the midsingle digit percentage growth expected in the display glass market the company expects display glass price declines to remain moderate down a midsingle percentage for the full year 

optical communications 

the following table provides net sales and net income for the optical communications segment 



2019 vs 2018 

net sales declined by 128 million or 3 in the year ended december 31 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to lower sales in carrier products down 199 million partially offset by an increase of 71 million in enterprise network sales sales were lower than expected due to weakness in the optical market highlighted by capital spending reductions at two of our significant customers in the latter half of 2019 

net income in the year ended december 31 2019 decreased by 103 million or 17 lower sales volumes in the latter half of 2019 drove less efficient factory utilization negatively impacting profitability 

movements in foreign currency exchange rates did not materially impact net income in this segment in the year ended december 31 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018 

outlook 

fullyear 2020 optical communications sales are expected to decrease by five to ten percent on a yearoveryear basis

liquidity and capital resources 

financing and capital structure 

the following items discuss corning’s financing and changes in capital structure during 2019 and 2018 

in the third quarter of 2019 corning issued two japanese yendenominated debt securities the “notes” as follows 

 ¥313 billion 1153 senior unsecured notes with a maturity of 12 years and 

 ¥59 billion 1513 senior unsecured notes with a maturity of 20 years 

the proceeds from the notes were received in japanese yen and converted to us dollars on the date of issuance the net proceeds received in us dollars after deducting offering expenses were approximately 349 million and will be used for general corporate purposes payments of principal and interest on the notes will be in japanese yen or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond corning’s control a us dollar equivalent 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 corning issued two us dollardenominated debt securities the “notes” as follows 

 400 million 390 senior unsecured notes with a maturity of 30 years and 

 11 billion 545 senior unsecured notes with a maturity of 60 years 

the net proceeds after deducting offering expenses were approximately 15 billion and will be used for general corporate purposes we can redeem these notes at any time subject to certain terms and conditions 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 corning redeemed 300 million of 425 notes due in 2020 paying a premium of 47 million by exercising our makewhole call the bond redemption resulted in an 84 million loss during the same quarter 

common stock dividends

fixed rate cumulative convertible preferred stock series a 

corning has 2300 outstanding shares of fixed rate cumulative convertible preferred stock series a the preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder and the company upon certain events at a conversion rate of 50000 shares of corning’s common stock per one share of preferred stock subject to certain antidilution provisions as of december 31 2019 the preferred stock has not been converted and none of the antidilution provisions have been triggered 

customer deposits 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018 corning had customer deposits of approximately 10 billion the majority of these represent nonrefundable cash deposits for customers to secure rights to an amount of glass produced by corning under longterm supply agreements the duration of these longterm supply agreements ranges up to ten years as glass is shipped to customers corning will recognize revenue and issue credit memoranda to reduce the amount of the customer deposit liability which are applied against customer receivables resulting from the sale of glass credit memoranda of 37 million were issued in 2019 no such memoranda were issued in 2018 

capital spending 

capital spending totaled 1978 million in 2019 a decrease of 264 million when compared to 2018 primarily driven by lower spending in the optical communications and display technologies segments we expect our 2020 capital expenditures to be approximately 15 billion 

cash flows 

summary of cash flow data in millions 



2019 vs 2018 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 888 million in the year ended december 31 2019 when compared to the same period last year primarily driven by a decrease in customer deposits received of 558 million and net unfavorable movements in working capital of 352 million 

in the year ended december 31 2019 net cash used in investing activities decreased by 996 million primarily driven by lower acquisition and capital expenditures of 842 million and 264 million respectively partially offset by the absence of cash received of 196 million for a contingent consideration asset when compared to the prior year 

net cash used in financing activities decreased by 1948 million in the year ended december 31 2019 when compared to the same period last year the primary drivers were lower share repurchases down 1287 million lower debt repayments down 329 million and increased borrowing up 346 million

off balance sheet arrangements 

off balance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 

corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include guarantee and indemnity contracts at the time a guarantee is issued the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant 

refer to note 13 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

for variable interest entities we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of its expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests which are the ownership contractual or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests 

corning has identified ten entities that qualify as a variable interest entity and are not consolidated these entities are not considered to be significant to corning’s consolidated financial statements 

corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit liquidity or market risk support to that entity

contractual obligations 

the amounts of our obligations follow in millions 



1 at december 31 2019 we had standby letters of credit commitments of 82 million 39 million was included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 

2 purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations which primarily consist of raw material and energyrelated takeorpay contracts 

3 capital expenditure obligations primarily reflect amounts associated with our capital expansion activities 

4 total debt above is stated at maturity value and excludes interest rate swap gains or losses and bond discounts 

5 the estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity or expiration of the related debt based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments 

6 at december 31 2019 58 million was included on our consolidated balance sheets related to uncertain tax positions 

we believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates that required us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates are set forth below 

impairment of assets held for use 

we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified we review our longlived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 

manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals primarily platinum and rhodium these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of longlived assets this review considers all the company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process in reclamation fabrication or refinement in anticipation of reuse or awaiting use to support increased capacity precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other nonmanufacturing related purposes 

© 2020 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

  

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include but are not limited to 

 a significant decrease in the market price of an asset 

 a significant change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used or in its physical condition 

 a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 

 an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset 

 a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset and 

 a current expectation that more likely than not an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities our assessment is performed at the reportable segment level for the majority of our reportable segments we concluded that locations or businesses within these segments which share production along the supply chain must be combined to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

for longlived assets when impairment indicators are present we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used assessments also consider changes in asset utilization including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production 

for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability the estimated fair value of longlived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of longlived assets and considers the fair market value of all precious metals if applicable we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value our estimates are based upon our historical experience our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

at december 31 2019 and 2018 the carrying value of precious metals was lower than the fair market value by 849 million and higher than the fair market value by 719 million respectively the majority of these precious metals are utilized by the display technologies and specialty materials segments corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments the potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments such events include but are not limited to a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our display technologies or specialty materials segments 

income taxes 

we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environments in which we do business it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances 

© 2020 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

  

corning accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc topic 740 income taxes which requires that companies only record tax benefits for technical positions that are believed to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement in estimating these amounts we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue a particular position or alternatively consider a negotiated compromise and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities’ assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position as a result it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates 

fair value measures 

as required corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the company’s own market assumptions once inputs have been characterized we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement in addition observable market data must be used when available and the highestandbestuse measure should be applied to nonfinancial assets corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are shortterm and longterm investments certain pension asset investments and derivatives these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions 

derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities included in our forward exchange contracts are foreign currency hedges that hedge our cash flow and translation exposure resulting from movements in the japanese yen south korean won euro new taiwan dollar chinese yuan and british pound changes in the fair value of contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings for contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the translated earnings contract gain loss net line of the consolidated statements of income loss in arriving at the fair value of corning’s derivative assets and liabilities we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction amounts related to credit risk are not material 

refer to note 15 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

probability of litigation outcomes 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter case law and other casespecific issues see part ii – item 3 legal proceedings for a discussion of corning’s material litigation matters 

other possible liabilities 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters including certain tax planning and environmental matters these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals

pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb 

corning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company’s assumptions related to general economic conditions particularly interest rates expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates the cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements mortality turnover and plan participation while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s employee pension and other postretirement obligations and current and future expense 

costs for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements 1 ongoing costs recognized quarterly which are comprised of service and interest costs expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs and 2 marktomarket gains and losses outside of the corridor where the corridor is equal to 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets at the beginning of the year which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year these gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment settlement or significant plan changes as well as any trueup to the annual valuation are recognized as a marktomarket adjustment in the quarter in which such event occurs 

costs for our opeb plans consist of ongoing costs recognized quarterly and are comprised of service and interest costs amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses we recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor 

the following table presents our actual and expected return on assets as well as the corresponding percentages 



as of december 31 2019 the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was 39 billion 

the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans 



© 2020 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

  

the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning’s funding requirements 

in addition at december 31 2019 a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would decrease shareholders’ equity by 133 million before tax and a 25 basis point increase in each spot rate would increase shareholders’ equity by 127 million in addition the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in each spot rate assumption related to corning’s us opeb plans 



 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo 

the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when all performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied and control of the product has been transferred to the customer if customer acceptance clauses are present and it cannot be objectively determined that control has been transferred revenue is only recorded when customer acceptance is received and all performance obligations have been satisfied sales of goods typically do not include multiple product andor service elements corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue over time the performance obligations under these contracts generally require services to be performed over time resulting in either a straightline amortization method or an input method using incurred and forecasted expense to predict revenue recognition patterns which follows satisfaction of the performance obligation 

on january 1 2018 we adopted the new revenue standard and applied the modified retrospective method of accounting to those contracts which were not completed as of january 1 2018 results for reporting periods beginning after january 1 2018 are presented under topic 606 while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under asc topic 605 “revenue recognition” because the impact of adopting the standard on corning’s financial statements was immaterial we have not made an adjustment to opening retained earnings 

one of corning’s equity affiliates adopted the new revenue standard on january 1 2019 the impact of adopting the new standard to corning’s financial statements was a net reduction of 186 million to 2019 beginning retained earnings timing of revenue recognition for certain open performance obligations as measured at january 1 2019 under the new standard was approximately 239 million with offsetting deferred tax impacts of 53 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects 

 exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings and 

 exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar which impact our net equity 

our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the japanese yen south korean won new taiwan dollar chinese yuan and the euro we seek to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using overthecounter otc derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts in general these hedges expire coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions 

we are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts however we minimize this risk by maintaining a diverse group of highlyrated major financial institutions as our counterparties we do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments 

our cash flow hedging activities utilize otc foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers we also use otc foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedged instruments these contracts are used to offset economic currency risks the undesignated hedges limit exposures to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies a significant portion of the company’s nonus revenues are denominated in japanese yen when these revenues are translated back to us dollars the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements in the japanese yen to protect translated earnings against movements in the japanese yen the company has entered into a series of average rate forwards and other derivative instruments 

we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exposures market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2019 with respect to open foreign exchange forward and option contracts and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 13 billion compared to 11 billion at december 31 2018 specific to the japanese yen a 10 adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 10 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018 the company expects that these hypothetical losses from a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates on the derivative financial instruments should largely offset gains on the assets liabilities and future transactions being hedged 

interest rate risk management 

to manage interest rate exposure the company from time to time enters into interest rate derivatives agreements in the second quarter of 2018 the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts of 300 million to hedge against the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to an anticipated debt issuance the instruments were designated as cash flow hedges and were settled with 16 million received on october 31 2018 concurrent with the debt issuance as of december 31 2019 there were no interest rate derivatives agreements outstanding

 item 1a risk factors 

﻿ 

we operate in rapidly changing economic political and technological environments that present numerous risks our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows our ability to successfully execute our strategy and capital allocation framework and the trading price of our common stock or debt the following discussion identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with our mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in our forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

﻿ 

as a global company we face many risks which could adversely impact our operations and financial results   

﻿ 

we are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from and have significant operations outside of the united states our international operations include manufacturing assembly sales research and development customer support and shared administrative service centers additionally we rely on a global supply chain for key components and capabilities that are central to our ability to invent make and sell products 

﻿ 

compliance with laws and regulations increases our costs we are subject to both us laws and local laws which among other things include data privacy requirements employment and labor laws tax laws anticompetition regulations prohibitions on payments to governmental officials import and trade restrictions and export requirements noncompliance or violations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and operating results our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks

we are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization including those related to 

﻿ 





























﻿ 

corning’s display technologies segment generates a significant amount of the company’s profits and cash flow any significant decrease in display glass pricing could have a material and negative impact on our financial results 

﻿ 

corning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely on the profitability of our display glass business which is subject to continuous pricing pressure due to industry competition potential overcapacity and development of new technologies if we are not able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs and increases in volume to offset potential pricing pressures it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

﻿ 

because we have a concentrated customer base in each of our businesses our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or insolvency of one or more key customers as well as our ability to retain these customers 

﻿ 

a relatively small number of endcustomers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in each of our reportable segments mergers and consolidations between customers could result in further concentration of corning’s customer base further concentration or the loss or insolvency of a key customer could result in a substantial loss of sales and reduction in anticipated in cash flows 

﻿ 

the following table details the number of combined customers of our segments that accounted for a large percentage of segment net sales 

﻿

business disruptions could affect our operating results 

﻿ 

a major earthquake fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future financial results could be materially and adversely affected for example certain manufacturing sites require high quality continuous and uninterrupted power and access to industrial water unplanned outages could have a material negative impact on our operations and ability to supply our customers 

﻿ 

additionally a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our reportable segments is concentrated in singlesite locations due to the specialized nature of the assets in the event such a location experiences disruption it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from other facilities accordingly disruption at a singlesite manufacturing operation could significantly impact corning’s ability to supply its customers and could produce a nearterm severe impact on our individual businesses and the company as a whole 

﻿ 

geopolitical events as well as other events outside of corning’s control could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers resulting in a negative impact to corning’s net sales net income asset values and liquidity 

﻿ 

a natural disaster epidemic labor strike war or political unrest in regions where we operate could adversely affect corning’s ability to supply our customers and impact the value of our assets such events may also impact our customers’ facilities and reduce our sales to such customers   for example a sizeable portion of corning’s glass manufacturing capacity is in south korea and we generate a significant portion of our sales through two south korean customers deterioration of the geopolitical climate in such a region could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers resulting in a negative impact to corning’s net sales net income asset values and liquidity 

﻿ 

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights which could result in loss of market share and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

﻿ 

we rely on patent and trade secret laws copyright trademark confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses we cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of or the unauthorized use of our intellectual property potentially resulting in loss of market share litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are often unpredictable if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive 

﻿ 

the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios we periodically receive notices from or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights andor breach of our agreements with them these third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design manufacture or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us

information technology dependency and cyber security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue liability claims or competitive harm 

﻿ 

the company is dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure including cloudbased services “it systems” to conduct its business our it systems may be vulnerable to disruptions from human error outdated applications computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized access cyberattack and other similar disruptions any significant disruption breakdown intrusion interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could cause the loss of data or intellectual property equipment damage downtime andor safety related issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business like other global companies we have from time to time experienced incidents related to our it systems and expect that such incidents will continue including malware and computer virus outbreaks unauthorized access systems failures and disruptions we have measures and defenses in place against such events but we may not be able to prevent immediately detect or remediate all instances of such events a material security breach or disruption of our it systems could result in theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information harm our competitive position disrupt our manufacturing reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives impair our ability to access vendors suppliers and cloudbased services or otherwise adversely affect our business 

﻿ 

additionally we believe that utilities and other operators of critical infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks including cyberattack in the event of such an attack disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power electrical gas etc 

﻿ 

we may not earn a positive return from our research development and engineering investments 

﻿ 

developing our products through our innovation model of research and development is expensive and often involves a long investment cycle we make significant expenditu res and investments in research development and engineering that may not earn an economic return if our investments do not provide a pipeline of products or technologies that our customers demand or lower our manufacturing costs it could negatively impact our revenues and operating margins both near and longterm 

﻿ 

we have significant exposure to foreign currency movements 

﻿ 

a large portion of our sales profit and cash flows are transacted in nonus dollar currencies and we expect that we will continue to experience fluctuations in the us dollar value of these activities if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our currency exposures or should we elect not to hedge certain currency exposures alternatively we may experience gains or losses if the underlying exposure which we have hedged changes increases or decreases and we are unable to reverse unwind or terminate the hedges concurrent with changes in the underlying notional exposure 

﻿ 

our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we have the exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors 

﻿ 

our hedge portfolio may reduce our ability to respond to price moves by our display technologies segment competitors foreign currency movements may impact our competitive cost position relative to our largest japanbased competitors in the display technologies segment the profitability of customers may also be impacted as they typically purchase from us in japanese yen and they sell in various currencies 

﻿ 

these factors could materially impact our results of operations anticipated future results financial position and cash flows the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control 

© 2019 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

 

  

we may have significant exposure to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio 

﻿ 

we maintain a significant portfolio of over the counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency exposure to the japanese yen new taiwan dollar south korean won chinese yuan and euro we are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

﻿ 

if we are unable to obtain certain specialized equipment raw and batch materials or natural resources required in our products or processes our business will suffer 

﻿ 

our ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of equipment parts components and raw materials from our suppliers we may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations certain manufacturing equipment components and raw materials are available only from single or limited sources and we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner a reduction interruption or delay of supply or a significant increase in the price for supplies such as manufacturing equipment precious metals raw materials utilities including energy and industrial water could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

﻿ 

we use specialized raw materials from singlesource suppliers eg specific mines or quarries and natural resources eg helium in certain products and processes if a supplier is unable to provide the required raw materials or the natural resource is in scarce supply or not readily available we may be unable to change our product composition or manufacturing process to prevent disruption to our business 

﻿ 

we have incurred and may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 

﻿ 

at december 31 2018 corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately 32 billion while we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable we cannot provide assurance that additional impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow as projected by management do not occur especially if an economic downturn occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe or if the company’s acquisitions and investments fail to achieve expected returns 

﻿ 

changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

﻿ 

our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors including 

﻿ 













© 2019 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

 

  

we may have additional tax liabilities 

﻿ 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

﻿ 

the 2017 tax act significantly impacted how us global corporations are taxed among other things the 2017 tax act required companies to pay a onetime mandatory tax on unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred the “toll charge” and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings significant guidance has been issued with the intention of clarifying the new tax provisions   to date a considerable amount of this guidance has been issued in the form of proposed regulations   the volume and complexity of the proposed regulations as well as the impact of final regulations which were recently issued has resulted in many questions regarding how the effect of such regulations should be considered   we continue to evaluate the impact of this legislation and certain changes could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow 

﻿ 

our innovation model depends on our ability to attract and retain specialized experts in our core technologies 

﻿ 

our innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science ceramic science and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities the loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering team without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance 

﻿ 

we are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations 

﻿ 

some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste waste water other industrial waste or greenhouse gases and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of such substances we have installed antipollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities we have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations however we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards 

﻿ 

any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us or the suspensioncessation of production or operations in addition environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

﻿ 

changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the us and other countries such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and co 2 abatement may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by among other things substantially increasing manufacturing costs limiting availability of scarce resources especially energy or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers 

© 2019 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

 

  

current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations 

﻿ 

as a global technology and manufacturing company we are engaged in various litigation and regulatory matters litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain and adverse rulings could occur resulting in significant liabilities penalties or damages such current or future substantial legal liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

﻿ 

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violation by an employee or the company may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the way existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

﻿ 

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our continued operation and expansion outside the united states including in developing countries could increase the risk of alleged violations violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

﻿ 

moreover several of our related partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws rules and business practices that differ from those in the united states and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws rules and business practices 

﻿ 

international trade policies may negatively impact our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the us 

  

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas tariffs and capital controls whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us including our equity affiliatesjoint ventures from being able to sell andor manufacture products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations these policies also affect our equity companies

﻿ 

total assets and capital expenditures by operating segment are included in note 17 reportable segments to the consolidated financial statements information concerning lease commitments is included in note 12 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

﻿ 

corning is a defendant in various lawsuits and is subject to various claims that arise in the normal course of business the most significant of which are summarized in note 12 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in the opinion of management the likelihood that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on corning’s consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations is remote 

﻿ 

environmental litigation corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by the agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 corning had accrued approximately 30 million undiscounted and 38 million undiscounted respectively for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote

organization of information 

﻿ 

management’s discussion and analysis provides a historical and prospective narrative on the company’s financial condition and results of operations this discussion includes the following sections 

﻿ 



















﻿ 

overview 

﻿ 

strategy and capital allocation framework   

﻿ 

in october 2015 corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework the “framework” that reflects the company’s financial and operational strengths as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value the framework outlines our leadership priorities and articulates the opportunities we see across our businesses we designed the framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength under the framework we target generating 26 billion to 30 billion of cash through 2019 returning more than 125 billion to shareholders and investing 10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth 

﻿ 

our probability of success increases as we invest in our worldclass capabilities corning is concentrating approximately 80 of its research development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies four manufacturing and engineering platforms and five marketaccess platforms this strategy will allow us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed 

﻿ 

performance against the framework 

﻿ 

since introducing the framework we have distributed 118 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and increased the annual dividend by 111 in 2019 161 in 2018 148 in 2017 and 125 in 2016 as part of our ongoing commitment to return cash to our investors 

﻿ 

highlights of progress in corning’s marketaccess platforms include

2018 results 

﻿ 

net sales in the year ended december 31 2018 were 113 billion an increase of 12 billion or 12 when compared to the year ended december 31 2017 driven by sales increases across all segments 

﻿ 

for the year ended december 31 2018 we generated net income of 11 billion or 113 per share compared to a net loss of 05 billion or 066 per share for 2017 when compared to 2017 the 16 billion increase in net income was primarily due to the following items amounts presented after tax 

﻿ 







﻿ 

partially offsetting these events were the following items 

﻿ 







﻿ 

diluted earnings per share increased by 179 per share or 271 when compared to 2017 driven by the increase in net income described above coupled with the repurchase of 748 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months 

﻿ 

the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including the impact of hedges realized in 2018 did not materially impact corning’s consolidated net income in the year ended december 31 2018 when compared to the year ended december 31 2017

﻿ 





﻿ 

for the year ended december 31 2017 the effective income tax rate differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following 

﻿ 







© 2019 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

 

  

the effective income tax rate for 2016 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

﻿ 





﻿ 

in december 2017 the us enacted the 2017 tax act which resulted in significant changes for our financial results including but not limited to 1 reducing the us federal corporate income tax rate to 21 and 2 imposing a onetime toll charge tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries of us companies that had not been previously taxed in the us 

﻿ 

given the significant complexity of the 2017 tax act and the lack of clear tax and accounting regulatory guidance for this new law the securities exchange commission issued its staff accounting bulletin 118 “sab 118” to provide registrants additional time to analyze and report the effects of tax reform during the “measurement period” under sab 118 the registrant was required to record those items where asc 740 analysis was complete include reasonable estimates and label them as provisional where asc 740 analysis was incomplete and if reasonable estimates could not be made record items under the previous tax law the measurement period not to exceed one year ended on the date the entity had obtained prepared and analyzed the information that was needed to complete the accounting requirements under asc topic 740 

﻿ 

the 2017 tax act also established new tax provisions affecting our 2018 results including but not limited to 1 creating a new provision to tax   global intangible lowtaxed income gilti 2 generally eliminating us federal taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 3 eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax “amt” 4 creating the base erosion antiabuse tax “beat” 5 establishing a deduction for foreign derived intangible income “fdii” 6 establishing new limitations on deductible interest expense and 7 establishing new limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation 

﻿ 

for the year ended december 31 2018 corning’s results included a worldwide tax provision of 437 million  inclusive of tax on ongoing operations of 412 million and the impacts of the 2017 tax act of 25 million the impacts of the 2017 tax act include gilti tax of 55 million fdii benefit of 10 million and a 20 million benefit related to truing up the toll charge and our measurement of us deferred taxe s offset by the recording of a provision related to lifting our assertion of indefinite reinvestment on certain foreign earnings   as of december 31 2018 corning has completed its analysis of the impact of the 2017 tax act as required by sab 118 the gilti tax of 55 million was largely driven by the receipt of customer deposits see note 2  revenue  to these consolidated financial statements for more information 

﻿ 

corning has completed its analysis on the impact of the 2017 tax act on its assertion regarding its indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings corning has determined that it will no longer assert indefinite asset reinvestment on 154 billion of unremitted foreign earnings accumulated prior to 2018 this represents approximately 94 of corning’s unremitted foreign earnings as of the end of 2017 corning will continue to indefinitely reinvest the remaining 6 of historic foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 

﻿ 

beginning in 2018 corning will indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings of 1 any of its subsidiaries located in jurisdictions where corning lacks the ability to repatriate its earnings 2 any of its subsidiaries where corning’s intention is to reinvest those earnings in operations 3 legal entities for which corning holds a noncontrolling interest 4 any subsidiaries with an accumulated deficit in earnings and profits and 5 any subsidiaries which have a positive earnings and profits balance but for which the entity lacks sufficient local statutory earnings or stock basis from which to make a distribution 

© 2019 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

 

  

during 2018 the company distributed approximately 42 billion from foreign subsidiaries to their respective us parent companies there are no incremental taxes beyond the toll charge due with respect to these distributions as of december 31 2018 corning has approximately 15 billion of indefinitely   reinvested foreign earnings  it remains impracticable to calculate the tax cost of repatriating our unremitted earnings which are considered indefinitely reinvested

comprehensive income 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

2018 vs 2017 

for the year ended december 31 2018 comprehensive income increased by 06 billion when compared to the same period in 2017 driven by an increase in net income of 16 billion largely driven by the absence of 15 billion in tax reform adjustments related to the 2017 tax act 

© 2019 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

 

  

﻿ 

partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in the gain on foreign currency translation adjustments in the amount of  0 9 billion aftertax largely driven by the strengthening of foreign currencies most significantly the south korean won euro and the chinese yuan which impacted comprehensive income in the amounts of 556 million  156 million and  114 million respectively 

﻿ 

2017 vs 2016 

for the year ended december 31 2017 comprehensive income decreased by 35 billion when compared to the same period in 2016 driven by a decrease in net income of 42 billion and a decrease in unamortized actuarial gains for postretirement benefit plans the significant decrease in net income was largely driven by the absence of a 27 billion nontaxable gain and a 105 million positive tax adjustment on the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in dow corning recorded in the second quarter of 2016 combined with the impact of the passage of the 2017 tax act which included a provisional toll charge of 11 billion and a provisional charge of 347 million as a result of the remeasurement of us deferred tax assets and liabilities our unamortized actuarial gains decreased driven by a decrease in the discount rates used to value our postretirement benefit obligations 

﻿ 

partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in the gain on foreign currency translation adjustments in the amount of 850 million aftertax largely driven by the weakening of foreign currencies most significantly the south korean won japanese yen and the euro which impacted comprehensive income in the amounts of 420 million 164 million and 115 million respectively

core performance measures 

﻿ 

in managing the company and assessing our financial performance we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to arrive at core performance measures these items include gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts acquisitionrelated costs certain discrete tax items restructuring and restructuringrelated charges certain litigationrelated expenses pension marktomarket adjustments and other items which do not reflect ongoing operating results of the company or our equity affiliates additionally corning has adopted the use of constant currency reporting for our display technologies and specialty materials segments for the japanese yen south korean won chinese yuan and new taiwan dollar currencies the company believes that the use of constant currency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows corning also believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions 

﻿ 

core performance measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” we believe investors should consider these nongaap measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends these measures are not and should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap reporting measures with respect to the company’s outlook for future periods it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these nongaap measures because the company does not forecast the movement of the japanese yen south korean won chinese yuan or new taiwan dollar against the us dollar or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the company’s control as a result the company is unable to provide outlook information on a gaap basis

in the year ended december 31 2018 we generated core earnings of 1673 million or 178 per share compared to core earnings generated in the year ended december 31 2017 of 1634 million or 160 per share the increase in core earnings of 39 million was driven by the following items 

﻿ 









﻿ 

partially offsetting these increases in earnings were the following 

﻿ 









﻿ 

core earnings per share increased in the year ended december 31 2018 to 178 per share driven by the increase in core income and lower weighted average shares outstanding due to repurchases of our common stock during 2018 

﻿ 

2017 vs 2016 

in the year ended december 31 2017 we generated core earnings of 1634 million or 160 per share compared to core earnings generated in the year ended december 31 2016 of 1651million or 144 per share the decrease in core earnings of 17 million was driven by the following items 

﻿ 







﻿ 

the decline was offset by an increase in core earnings in the optical communications segment of 118 million due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products combined with the absence of the production issues in the first half of 2016 related to the implementation of new software and an increase in the specialty materials segment of 73 million driven by an increase in corning gorilla glass and advanced optics products 

﻿ 

although core net earnings decreased in the year ended december 31 2017 core earnings per share increased 016 per share driven by lower weighted average shares outstanding due to repurchases of our common stock in 2017 

﻿ 

included in core earnings for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 is net periodic pension expense in the amount of 52 million 49 million and 51 million respectively which excludes the annual pension marktomarket adjustments in the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 the marktomarket adjustments pretax losses of 145 million 21 million and 67 million respectively

reconciliation of nongaap measures 

we utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with gaap to assess our financial and operating performance a nongaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that i excludes amounts or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income or statement of cash flows or ii includes amounts or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income or statement of cash flows

translated earnings contracts 

﻿ 

corning has hedged a significant portion of its projected yen exposure for the period 2018 through 2022 with average rate forwards collars and puts in the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 we recorded pretax net losses of 96 million 201 million and 459 million related to changes in the fair value of these instruments included in these amounts are realized gains of 64 million 268 million and 207 million respectively the gross notional value outstanding for these instruments which hedge our exposure to the japanese yen at december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 was 116 billion 13 billion and 149 billion respectively 

﻿ 

we have entered into zerocost collars and average rate forwards to hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the south korean won and its impact on our net income in the year ended december 31 2018 we recorded a pretax net loss of 26 million and in the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 we recorded pretax net gains of 95 million and 7 million respectively related to changes in the fair value of these instruments included in these amounts is a realized gain of 46 million and realized losses of 1 million and 7 million respectively these instruments had a gross notional value outstanding at december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 of 01 billion 08 billion and 12 billion respectively 

﻿ 

we have entered into a portfolio average rate forwards to hedge against our euro translation exposure in the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 we recorded a pretax gain of 43 million a net pretax loss of 40 million and a net pretax gain of 15 million respectively  included in these amounts are realized losses of 14 million and 2 million and a realized gain of 1 million respectively at dec ember 31 2018 the eurodenominated average rate instruments had a gross notional amount of 12 billion and at 2017 and 2016 a gross notional amount of 03 billion

off balance sheet arrangements 

﻿ 

off balance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 

﻿ 

corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include guarantee contracts at the time a guarantee is issued the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant 

﻿

for variable interest entities we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of its expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests which are the ownership contractual or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests 

﻿ 

corning has identified ten entities that qualify as a variable interest entity and are not consolidated these entities are not considered to be significant to corning’s consolidated statements of position

critical accounting estimates 

﻿ 

the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates that required us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates are set forth below 

﻿ 

acquired assets and liabilities 

﻿ 

we account for the acquisition of a business using the purchase method of accounting which requires us to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed this includes acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles and patents fixed assets and inventories liabilities assumed may include litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining the related fair values independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities such appraisals are based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecasted revenues and profits utilized in determining the fair value of contractrelated acquired intangible assets or liabilities significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired as well as differences in actual and estimated results could result in impacts to our financial results additional information related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities obtained during the allocation period not to exceed one year may result in changes to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired 

﻿ 

in 2018 we acquired cmd fro m 3m in a business combination included in the acquisition were o ther intangible assets consist ing primarily of 434 million of customer relationships and 91 million of other intangibles that are amortized over the weighted average useful life of approximately 14 and 11 years respectively  the customer relationship intangible asset was valued using the multiperiod excess earnings valuation method which is an income approach method that estimates fair value of revenue based upon the present value of cash flows that are expected to be generated from the acquired customer base  key assumptions used in this valuation include a discount rate of 125 revenue growth rates in the range of 0 to 3 and a customer attrition rate of 6 

﻿ 

impairment of assets held for use 

﻿ 

we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified we review our longlived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 

﻿ 

manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals primarily platinum and rhodium these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of longlived assets this review considers all the company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process in reclamation fabrication or refinement in anticipation of reuse or awaiting use to support increased capacity precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other nonmanufacturing related purposes 

﻿

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include but are not limited to 

﻿ 













﻿ 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities our assessment is performed at the reportable segment level for the majority of our reportable segments we concluded that locations or businesses within these segments which share production along the supply chain must be combined to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

﻿ 

for longlived assets when impairment indicators are present we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used assessments also consider changes in asset utilization including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 

﻿ 

for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability the estimated fair value of longlived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of longlived assets and considers the fair market value of all precious metals we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value our estimates are based upon our historical experience our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

﻿ 

at december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by 719 million and 711 million respectively the majority of these precious metals are utilized by the display technologies and specialty materials segments corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments the potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments such events include but are not limited to a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our display technologies or specialty materials segments

impairment of goodwill 

﻿ 

we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level   a reporting unit is equivalent to an operating segment or a component of an operating segment which constitutes a business and for which discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by segment management   an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 

﻿ 

corning has recorded goodwill in the display technologies optical communications specialty materials life sciences and all other operating segments   each of these operating segments is a separate reporting unit however specialty materials and all other are each made up of two separate reporting units on a quarterly basis or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may be impaired management performs a qualitative assessment of factors in each reporting unit within these operating segments to determine if there have been any triggering events   we also perform a detailed quantitative impairment test every three years if no indicators suggest a test should be performed in the interim   we use this calculation as a quantitative validation of the qualitative process this process does not represent an election to perform the quantitative impairment test in place of the qualitative review 

﻿ 

the qualitative assessment is performed by assessing various factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount   these factors include but are not limited to changes in macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance other relevant entityspecific events or a sustained decrease in share price 

﻿ 

in 2018 we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in addition to assessing the qualitative factors each quarter   our assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process   this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the longterm growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows our valuation method is an “income approach” using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate    our estimates are based upon our historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends   the quantitative assessment requires the e xercise of significant judgment  including judgment about appropriate discount rates growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows of the respective reporting unit 

﻿ 

the   quantitative assessment of goodwill resulted in fair values significantly exceeding the carrying values for all of our reporting units we also performed a sensitivity analysis using a range between 710 for the discount rate and 03 for the growth rate which had no material impact on our results   based on the quantitative test performed in 2018 no goodwill impairment was required 

﻿ 

income taxes 

﻿ 

we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environments in which we do business it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances 

﻿ 

© 2019 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

 

  

corning accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc topic 740 income taxes which requires that companies only record tax benefits for technical positions that are believed to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement in estimating these amounts we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue a particular position or alternatively consider a negotiated compromise and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities’ assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position as a result it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates 

﻿ 

as of december 31 2018 corning has completed its analysis of the impact of the 2017 tax act as required by sab 118  

﻿ 

beginning in 2018 corning will indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings of 1 any of its subsidiaries located in jurisdictions where corning lacks the ability to repatriate its earnings 2 any of its subsidiaries where corning’s intention is to reinvest those earnings in operations 3 legal entities for which corning holds a noncontrolling interest 4 any subsidiaries with an accumulated deficit in earnings and profits and 5 any subsidiaries which have a positive earnings and profits balance but for which the entity lacks sufficient local statutory earnings or stock basis from which to make a distribution 

﻿ 

under the 2017 tax act a company can make a policy election to account for the tax on gilti as a period cost or to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities when basis differences exist that are expected to affect the amount of gilti inclusion upon reversal   corning has elected to account for the gi lti provisions as a period cost 

﻿ 

fair value measures 

﻿ 

as required corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the company’s own market assumptions once inputs have been characterized we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement in addition observable market data must be used when available and the highestandbestuse measure should be applied to nonfinancial assets corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are shortterm and longterm investments certain pension asset investments and derivatives these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions 

﻿ 

derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities included in our forward exchange contracts are foreign currency hedges that hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the japanese yen south korean won euro new taiwan dollar chinese yuan and british pound these contracts are not designated as accounting hedges and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the translated earnings contract loss net line of the consolidated statements of income loss in arriving at the fair value of corning’s derivative assets and liabilities we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction amounts related to credit risk are not material

probability of litigation outcomes 

﻿ 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter case law and other casespecific issues see part ii – item 3 legal proceedings for a discussion of corning’s material litigation matters 

﻿ 

other possible liabilities 

﻿ 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters including certain tax planning and environmental matters these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 

﻿ 

pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb 

﻿ 

corning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company’s assumptions related to general economic conditions particularly interest rates expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates the cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements mortality turnover and plan participation while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s employee pension and other postretirement obligations and current and future expense 

﻿ 

costs for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements 1 ongoing costs recognized quarterly which are comprised of service and interest costs expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs and 2 marktomarket gains and losses outside of the corridor where the corridor is equal to 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets at the beginning of the year which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year these gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment settlement or significant plan changes as well as any trueup to the annual valuation are recognized as a marktomarket adjustment in the quarter in which such event occurs 

﻿ 

costs for our opeb plans consist of ongoing costs recognized quarterly and are comprised of service and interest costs amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses we recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions as a component of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor 

﻿

the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans 

﻿ 



﻿ 

the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning’s funding requirements 

﻿ 

in addition at december 31 2018 a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would decrease stockholders’ equity by 112 million before tax and a 25 basis point increase in each spot rate would increase stockholders’ equity by 107 million in addition the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate

revenue recognition 

﻿ 

the company recognizes revenue when all performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied and control of the product has been transferred to the customer if customer acceptance clauses are present and it cannot be objectively determined that control has been transferred revenue is only recorded when customer acceptance is received and all performance obligations have been satisfied sales of goods typically do not include multiple product andor service elements corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue over time the performance obligations under these contracts generally require services to be performed over time resulting in either a straightline amortization method or an input method using incurred and forecasted expense to predict revenue recognition patterns which follows satisfaction of the performance obligation 

﻿ 

on january 1 2018 we adopted accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers and applied the modified retrospective method of accounting to those contracts which were not completed as of january 1 2018 results for reporting periods beginning after january 1 2018 are presented under topic 606 while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under asc topic 605 “revenue recognition” because the impact of adopting the standard on corning’s financial statements was immaterial we have not made an adjustment to opening retained earnings

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

﻿ 

we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects 

﻿ 





﻿ 

our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the japanese yen south korean won new taiwan dollar chinese yuan and the euro we seek to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using overthecounter otc derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts in general these hedges expire coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions 

﻿ 

we are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts however we minimize this risk by maintaining a diverse group of highlyrated major financial institutions as our counterparties we do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments 

﻿ 

our cash flow hedging activities utilize otc foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers we also use otc foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the undesignated hedges limit exposures to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies a significant portion of the company’s nonus revenues are denominated in japanese yen when these revenues are translated back to us dollars the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements in the japanese yen to protect translated earnings against movements in the japanese yen the company has entered into a series of average rate forwards and other derivative instruments 

﻿ 

we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2018 with respect to open foreign exchange forward and option contracts and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 11 billion compared to 14 billion at december 31 2017 specific to the japanese yen a 10 adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 10 billion compared to 1 3 b illion at december 31 2017 the company expects that these hypothetical losses from a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates on the derivative financial instruments should largely offset gains on the assets liabilities and future transactions being hedged 

﻿ 

interest rate risk management 

﻿ 

to manage interest rate exposure the company from time to time enters into interest rate derivatives agreements in the second quarter of 2018 the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts of 300 million to hedge against the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to an anticipated debt issuance the instruments were designated as cash flow hedges and were settled with 16 million received on october 31 2018 concurrent with the debt issuance

raw materials 

﻿ 

corning’s manufacturing processes   and products require access to uninterrupted power sources significant quantities of industrial water certain precious metals and various batch materials availability of resources ores minerals polymers helium and processed chemicals required in manufacturing operations appears to be adequate corning’s suppliers from time to time may experience capacity limitations in their own operations or may eliminate certain product lines corning believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of raw and batch materials as well as precious metals for many of its products corning has alternate suppliers that would allow operations to continue without interruption in the event of specific materials shortages 

﻿ 

certain key materials and proprietary equipment used in the manufacturing of products are currently solesourced or available only from a limited number of suppliers to minimize this risk corning closely monitors raw materials and equipment with limited availability or which are sourced through one supplier however any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components and or   raw materials could result in lost sales due to delays or reductions in product shipments or reductions in corning’s gross margins 

﻿ 

patents and trademarks 

﻿ 

inventions by members of corning’s research and engineering staff continue to be important to the company’s growth patents have been granted on many of these inventions in the united states and other countries some of these patents have been licensed to other manufacturers many of our earlier patents have now expired but corning continues to seek and obtain patents prot ecting its innovations in 2017  corning was granted about 560 patents in the us and over 1280 patents in countries outside the us 

﻿ 

each business segment possesses a patent portfolio that provides certain competitive advantages in protecting corning’s innovations corning has historically enforced and will continue to enforce its intellectual property rights at the end of 201 7  corning and its whollyowned subsidiaries owned over 10900 unexpired patents in various countries of which over 4560 were us patents between 2018 and 2020 approximately 7 of these patents will expire while at the same time corning intends to seek patents protecting its newer innovations worldwide corning has about 10300 patent applications in process with about 2280 in process in the us corning believes that its patent portfolio will continue to provide a competitive advantage in protecting the company’s innovation although corning’s competitors in each of its businesses are actively seeking patent protection as well 

﻿

 item 1a risk factors 

﻿ 

we operate in rapidly changing economic  political and technological environments that present numerous risks many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows our ability to successfully execute our strategy and capital allocation framework and the trading price of our common stock or debt the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in our forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

﻿ 

as a global company we face many risks which could adversely impact our operations and reported financial results   

﻿ 

we are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from and have significant operations outside of the united states our international operations include manufacturing assembly sales research and development customer support and shared administrative service centers 

© 2018 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

 

  

compliance with laws and regulations increases our costs we are subject to both us laws and local laws which  among other things include data privacy requirements employment and labor laws tax laws anticompetition regulations prohibitions on payments to governmental officials import and trade restrictions and export requirements noncompliance or violations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks 

﻿ 

we are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization including those related to  

﻿ 





























﻿ 

corning’s display technologies segment generates a significant amount of the company’s profits and cash flow  a ny significant decrease in lcd glass pricing could have a material and negative impact on our financial results 

﻿ 

corning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the profitability of our lcd glass business  which is subject to continuous pricing pressure due to intense industry competition  potential over capacity  and   development of new technologies if we are not   able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or sustain our current rate of cost reduction to offset potential pricing pressures it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results  

﻿ 

because we have a concentrated customer base in each of our businesses o ur sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or insolvency of one or more key customers  as well as our ability to retain these customers 

﻿ 

a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in our reportable segments m ergers and consolidations between customers could result in   further concentration of corning’s customer base if further concentration occurs or a key customer becomes insolvent the loss of a key customer could result in a substantial loss of sales and reduction in anticipated in cash flows unforeseen events or actions on the part of corning could also result in the loss of customers resulting in further customer concentration 

© 2018 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

 

  

the following table details the number of combined customers of our segments that accounted for a large percentage of segment net sales 

﻿ 



﻿ 

business disruptions could affect our operating results 

﻿ 

a major earthquake fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future financial results could be materially and adversely affected   for example certain manufacturing sites require high quality continuous and uninterrupted power and access to industrial water unplanned outages could have a material negative impact on our operations and ability to supply our customers 

﻿ 

additionally a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our reportable segment s is concentrated in singlesite locations and it is reasonably possible that the operations of one or more such facilities could be disrupted due to the specialized nature of the assets it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from other facilities accordingly a disruption at a singlesite manufacturing operation could significantly impact corning’s ability to supply its customers and could produce a nearterm severe impact on our individual business es and the company as a whole 

﻿ 

geopolitical events as well as other events outside of corning’s control could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers resulting in a negative impact to corning’s net sales net income asset values and liquidity 

﻿ 

a natural disaster epidemic labor strike war or political unrest may adversely affect cornings ability to supply our customers and impact the value of our assets such events may also impact our customers’ facilities and reduce our sales to such customers for example a sizeable portion of corning’s glass manufacturing capacity is located in south korea and we generate a significant portion of our sales through two south korean customers deterioration of the geopolitical climate in such a region could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers resulting in a negative impact to corning’s net sales net income asset values and liquidity 

﻿ 

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights which could result in loss of market share and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

﻿ 

we rely on patent and trade secret laws copyright trademark confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses we cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property worldwide may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of or the unauthorized use of our intellectual property potentially resulting in loss of market share litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are often unpredictable if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive 

﻿ 

the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios we periodically receive notices from or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights andor breach of our agreements with them these third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design manufacture or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us

information technology dependency and cyber security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue liability claims or competitive harm 

﻿ 

the company is dependent on information technology “it” systems and infrastructure for its business and manufacturing controls    our it systems may be vulnerable to disruptions from human error outdated applications computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized access cyberattack and other similar disruptions any significant disruption breakdown intrusion interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could caus e the loss of data equipment damage downtim e andor safety related issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business like other global companies we have from time to time experienced incidents related to our it systems and expect that such incidents will continue including malware and computer virus attacks unauthorized access systems failures and disruptions we have measures and defenses in place against unauthorized access but we may not be able to prevent immediately detect or remediate such events a material breach in the security of our it systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets such disruptions or security breaches could result in the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information harm our competitive position disrupt our manufacturing reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business 

﻿ 

additionally we believe that utilities and other operators of critical infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks including cyberattack in the event of such an attack disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power electrical gas etc 

﻿ 

we may not earn a positive return from our research  development and engineering investments     

﻿ 

developing our products through our innovation model of research and development is expensive and often involves a long investment cycle we make significant expenditures and investments in research and development and four process engineering platforms that may earn an economic return  if our investments do not provide a pipeline of new technologies that our customers demand or lower cost manufacturing platforms it could negatively impact our revenues and operating margins both near and longterm 

﻿ 

we have significant exposure to foreign currency movements 

﻿ 

a large portion of our sales profit and cash flows are transacted in nonus dollar currencies and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to these exposures we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our currency exposures or should we elect not to hedge certain currency exposures alternatively we may experience gains or losses if the underlying exposure which we have hedged change increases or decreases and we are unable to reverse unwind or terminate the hedges concurrent with the change in the underlying notional exposure 

﻿ 

our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we have the exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors our hedge portfolio may reduce our flexibility to respond to price moves by our display technologies segment competitors 

﻿ 

foreign currency movements may also impact our competitive cost position relative to our largest japanbased competitors in the display technologies segment the profitability of customers may also be impacted as they typically purchase from us in japanese yen and they sell in various currencies 

﻿ 

all of these factors could materially impact our results of operations anticipated future results financial position and cash flows the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control 

﻿ 

we have significant exposure to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio 

﻿ 

we maintain a significant portfolio of over the counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency exposure to the japanese yen new taiwan dollar south korean won chinese yuan and euro we are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows

if we are unable to obtain certain specialized equipment raw and batch materials or natural resources required in our products or processes  our business will suffer 

﻿ 

our ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of equipment parts and components from our suppliers  we may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations there can be no assurances that we will not encounter proble ms in the future c ertain manufacturing equipment and components are available only from single or limited sources  and we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner a reduction interruption or delay of supply or a significant increase in the price for supplies such as manufacturing equipment precious metals raw materials  utilities including energy and industrial water  could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

﻿ 

we use specialized raw materials from singlesource suppliers eg specific mines or quarries and natural resources eg helium in certain products and processes if a supplier is unable to provide the required raw materials or the natural resource is in scarce supply or not readily available we may be unable to change our product composition or manufacturing process in order to prevent a disruption to our business 

﻿ 

we have incurred and may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 

﻿ 

at december 31 2017  corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately  26 billion  while we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable we cannot provide assurance that additional impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe or if acquisitions and investments made by the company fail to achieve expected returns 

﻿ 

changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

﻿ 

our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors including 

﻿ 













﻿ 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

﻿ 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

﻿ 

the recent 2017 tax act could significantly impact how us global corporations are taxed we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this new legislation and certain changes could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow among other things t he 2017 tax act requires companies to pay a onetime mandatory tax on unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred the “toll charge” and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings the toll charge resulted in an additional 1 1 billion provisional tax expense however s ettlement of the toll charge will occur almost entirely through the use of existing f oreign t ax c redit carryovers of 1 1 billion  

﻿ 

our innovation model depends on our ability to attract and retain specialized experts in our core technologies 

﻿ 

our innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science ceramic science and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities the loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering team without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance 

© 2018 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

 

  

we are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations 

﻿ 

some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste waste water other industrial waste or greenhouse gases and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of such substances we have installed antipollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities we have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations however we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards 

﻿ 

any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us or the suspensioncessation of production or operations in addition environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

﻿ 

changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the us and other countries such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and co 2 abatement may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by among other things substantially increasing manufacturing costs limiting availability of scarce resources especially energy or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers 

﻿ 

current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations 

﻿ 

as a global technology and manufacturing company w e are engaged in various litigation and regulatory matters litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain and adverse rulings could occur resulting in significant liabilities penalties or damages such current or future substantial legal liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

﻿ 

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of anti  boycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violation by an employee or the company may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

﻿ 

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our continued operation and expansion outside the united states including in developing countries could increase the risk of alleged violations violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

﻿ 

moreover several of our related partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws rules and business practices that differ from those in the united states and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws rules and business practices

international trade policies may negatively impact our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the us 

  

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas tariffs and capital controls whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us including our equity affiliates joint ventures  from being able to sell andor manufacture products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations these policies also affect our equity companies

environmental litigation corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by the agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 corning had accrued approximately 38 million undiscounted  and  43 million undiscounted respectively for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote

overview 

﻿ 

strategy and capital allocation framework   

﻿ 

in october 2015 corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework the “framework” that reflects the company’s financial and operational strengths as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value the framework outlines our leadership priorities and articulates the opportunities we see across our businesses we designed the framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength under the framework we target generating 26 billion to 30 billion of cash through 2019 returning more than 125 billion to shareholders and investing 10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth 

﻿ 

our probability of success increases as we invest in our worldclass capabilities corning is concentrating approximately 80 of its research development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies four manufacturing and engineering platforms and five marketaccess platforms this strategy will allow us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed 

﻿ 

performance against the framework 

﻿ 

since introducing the fra mework we have distributed 9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and increased the annual dividend by 161 in 2018 148 in 2017 and 125 in 2016 as part of our ongoing commitment to return cash to our investors 

﻿ 

we also utilized our financial strength in 2017 to continue our focus on innovation advancing key programs across our market platforms some of our achievements in 2017 included

2017 results 

﻿ 

net sales in the year ended december 31 2017 were 10116 million  an increase of 726 million  or 8 when compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was driven by the optical communications and the specialty materials segment s  up 540 million and 279 million  respectively the environmental technologies and life sciences segments also increased up 74 million and  40 million  respectively a decline in net sales of 241 million in the display technologies segment partially offset these increases driven by price declines of approximately 10 

﻿ 

for the year ended december 31 201 7  we generated a net loss of  497 million  or  066 per share compared to net income of  3695 million  or  323 per share for 201 6  when compared to last year the  42 billion   de crease in net income was due to the following items amounts presented after tax 

﻿ 











﻿ 

partially offsetting these events were the following items 

﻿ 















﻿ 

the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including the impact of hedges realized in 2017 did not materially impact corning’s consolidated net income in the year ended december 30 2017 when compared to the year ended december 31 2016

2018 corporate outlook 

we believe 2018 will be another year of strong growth and investment consistent with our strategy and capital allocation framework and anticipate that core sales will grow to approximately 11 billion in our display technologies segment we expect pricing to continue to improve with yearoveryear declines reaching midsingle digits an important milestone toward our goal of stabilizing returns we anticipate corning’s lcd glass volume will grow faster than the expected lcd glass market growth of midsingle digits driven by television screen size growth and the ramp of our gen 105 facility in china in the optical communications segment we expect sales to increase by about 10 excluding any contribution from the pending acquisition of 3m’s communications market division driven by strong demand from carrier and enterprise network customers we expect highsingle digit sales growth in our environmental technologies segment driven by continued strength in automotive product sales ongoing improvements in the heavyduty diesel market and from the commercial launch of gasparticulate filters we expect growth in the specialty materials segment the rate of which will depend on new model launches and the adoption of our innovations and anticipate midsingle digit growth in the life sciences segment

on may 31 2016 corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in dow corning corporation “dow corning” pursuant to the transaction agreement announced on december 10 2015 under the terms of the transaction agreement corning exchanged with dow corning its 50 stock interest in dow corning for 100 of the stock of a newly formed entity which holds an equity interest in hemlock semiconductor group and approximately 48 billion in cash

the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected corning’s i ncome before income taxes in the year ended december 31 2016 in the amount of 304 million when compared to 2015 this impact was partially offset by the decrease in the realized gain from our foreign currency translation hedges related to translated earnings of 452 million

corning’s results for the year ending december 31 2017 included a total 2 2 billion worldwide tax provision inclusive of tax on normal operations and the impacts of the 2017 tax act given the significant complexity of the 2017 tax act and anticipated future guidance from the u s treasury the securities and exchange commission and the financial accounting standards board “fasb” related to the 2017 tax act the se curities exchange commission has issued its staff accounting bulletin 118 “sab 118” to provide registrants additional time to analyze and report the effects of tax reform during the “measurement period” under sab 118 the registrant is required to record those items where asc 740 analysis is complete include reasonable estimates and label them as provisional where asc 740 analysis is incomplete and if reasonable estimates cannot be made record items under the previous tax law the measurement period ends on the date the entity has obtained prepared and analyzed the information that was needed in order to complete the accounting requirements under asc topic 740 and is not to exceed 1 year 

﻿ 

in addition to sab 118 the fasb has issued guidance regarding how to account for tax reform as well as a proposal to reclassify stranded tax costs from aoci to retained earnings furthermore to date the us treasury has issued notice 201807 on december 29 2017 and notice 201813 on january 19 2018 with additional guidance on how to compute the toll charges 

﻿ 

at december 31 2017 we have not completed our accoun ting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 tax act however we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our us deferred tax balances in the amount of 347 million  the onetime toll charge of 11 billion and the impact on our state valuation allowances and recorded these as provisional amounts  the initial accounti ng is incomplete as we need additional time and information to analyze all aspects of the newly enacted law and how it impacts our worldwide operations   the additional information that needs to be obtained prepared or analyzed in order to complete the accounting requirements includes receiving further guidance from the tax authorities additional time to prepare basis calculations postenactment impacts and further time to validate our assumptions 

﻿ 

we remeasured the us deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future which is generally 21 however we are still analyzing certain aspects of the 2017 tax act and refining our calculations which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts the provisional amount recorded related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balances was 34 7 million    

﻿ 

the onetime toll charge is based on our unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred this charge resulted in an additional provisional tax expense amount of 1 1 billion  we have not yet completed our calculation of the toll charge this amount may change when we finalize the calculation of unrepatriated earnings that w ere previously deferred from us federal taxation and finalize the amounts held in cash or other specified assets settlement of the toll charge will occur almost entirely t hrough the use of existing f oreign t ax c redit carryovers 

﻿ 

corning has not made sufficient progress on estimating the impact of tax reform on its assertion regarding its indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings so the company will continue to follow its historic position while it continues to analyze this issue as of december 31 2017 corning estimates that its unremitted foreign earnings were 169 billion  while corning is not changing its assertion at this time the company has distribute d approximately 2 billion in january 201 8 from two of its foreign subsidiaries to the us parent of those subsidiaries there are no incremental taxes beyond the toll charge due with respect to this distribution of cash 

﻿ 

under its historic policy corning will continue to indefinitely reinvest substantially all of its foreign earnings with the exception of an immaterial amount of current earnings that have very low or no tax cost associated with their repatriation our current analysis indicates that we have sufficient us liquidity including borrowing capacity to fund foreseeable us cash needs without requiring the repatriation of foreign cash 

﻿ 

corning’s accounting for the impact of the global intangible lowtaxed income gilti provisions of the 2017 tax act is incomplete and as a result it has not yet elected a policy to account for the gilti provisions 

﻿ 

we will continue to monitor future guidance and to assess the impacts of the 2017 tax act

it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change due to one or more of the following events during the next twelve months audit activity tax payments or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various jurisdictions within which we operate we believe we have provided adequate contingent reserves for these events  however if upon conclusion of these matters the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount materially different than our current reserves our overall tax expense and effective tax rate could be materially impacted in the period of adjustment

comprehensive income 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

2017 vs 2016 

for the year ended december 31 2017 comprehensive income decreased by 35 billion  when compared to the same period in 2016 driven by a decrease in net income of 42 billion and a de crease in unamortized actuarial gains for postretirement benefit plans  the significant decrease in net income was largely driven by the absence of a 27 billion nontaxable gain and a 105 million positive tax adjustment on the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in dow corning recorded in the second quarter of 2016 combined with the impact of the passage of the   2017 tax act  which included a provisional toll charge of 11 billion and a provisional charge of 347 million as a result of the remeasurement of us deferred tax assets and liabilities our unamortized actuarial gains decreased driven by a decrease in the discount rates used to value our postretirement benefit obligations 

﻿ 

partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in the gain on foreign currency translation adjustments in the amount of 850 million aftertax  largely driven by the weakening of foreign currencies most significantly the south korean won japanese

yen and the euro which impacted comprehensive income in the amounts of 420 million  164 million and 115 million  respectively 

﻿ 

2016 vs 2015 

for the year ended december 31 2016 comprehensive income increased by 2995 million when compared to the same period in 2015 driven by an increase of 2356 million in net income the positive impact of the change in foreign currency translation adjustments and an increase in unamortized actuarial gains for postretirement benefit plans 

﻿ 

the decrease in the loss on foreign currency translation adjustments for the year ended december 31 2016 in the amount of 486 million aftertax was driven by the following items 1 the decrease in the loss on the translation of corning’s consolidated subsidiaries in the amount of 398 million  largely driven by the strengthening of the japanese yen and 2 the decrease in the loss in the translation of corning’s equity method investments in the amount of 88 million  driven by the realignment of our ownership interests in dow corning 

﻿ 

the increase in unamortized actuarial gains for postretirement benefit plans in the amount of 120 million aftertax is due to the following 1 the decrease of 65 million related to the reclassification of actuarial gains to the income statement largely due to higher pension asset returns 2 an increase in actuarial losses of 3 million  and 3 a decrease of 188 million in unamortized losses related to our equity companies the significant change was driven by the release of dow corning’s unamortized actuarial loss which was included in the gain on the realignment of our ownership interests in dow corning

core performance measures 

﻿ 

in managing the company and assessing our financial performance we supplement certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements with measures adjusted to exclude certain items to arrive at core performance measures we believe that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions corning has adopted the use of constant currency reporting for the japanese yen and south korean won and uses an internally derived yentodollar management rate of ¥99 and wontodollar management rate of ₩1100 the company believes that the use of constant currency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations  and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contract s used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows  

﻿ 

net sales equity in earnings of affiliated companies and net income are adjusted to exclude the impacts of changes in the japanese yen and the south korean won gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts  acquisitionrelated costs certain discrete tax items restructuring and restructuringrelated charges certain litigationrelated expenses pension marktomarket adjustments and other items which do not reflect ongoing operating results of the company or our equity affiliates management’s discussion and analysis on our reportable segments has also been adjusted for these items as appropriate these measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” we believe investors should consider these nongaap measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends these measures are not and should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap reporting measures with respect to the company’s outlooks for future periods it is not able to provide reconciliations for these nongaap measures because the company does not forecast the movement of the japanese yen and south korean won against the us dollar or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the company’s control as a result the company is unable to provide outlook information on a gaap basis

core net sales 

﻿ 

the following table presents core net sales by reportable segment in millions  

﻿ 



﻿ 

in all segments except display technologies core net sales are consistent with gaap net sales because a significant portion of revenues in the display technologies segment are denominated in japanese yen this segment’s net sales are adjusted to remove the impact of translating yen into dollars as of january 1 2015 we use an internally derived management rate of ¥99 which is closely aligned to our current yendenominated hedges related to translated earnings 

﻿ 

core net sales in creased by  804 million or 8 in the year ended december 31 201 7 when compared to the same period in 201 6 driven by increases in the optical communications and specialty materials segments  lower core net sales in the display technologies segment partially offset the increase down 162 million  or 5 driven by lcd glass price declines of approximately 10 partially offset by an increase in volume in the midsingle digits in percentage terms 

﻿ 

core net sales decreased by 90 million in the year ended december 31 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 core net sales in the display technologies segment decreased by 218 million  or 6 in the year ended december 31 2016 driven by lcd glass price declines slightly higher than 10 partially offset by an increase in volume of a midsingle digit percentage 

﻿ 

the translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates  excluding the japanese yen and south korean won  in the year ended december 31 2017   positively impacted core net sales in the amount of  12 million and in the year ended december 31 2016 negatively impacted core net sales in the amount of  39 million

core earnings 

﻿ 

2017 vs 2016 

in the year ended december 31 2017 we generated core earnings of 1756 million or 172 per share compared to core earnings generated in the year ended december 31 2016 of 1774 million  or 155 per share the decrease in core earnings of 18 million was driven by the following items 

﻿ 







﻿ 

the decline was offset by an increase in core earnings in the optical communications segment of 99 million  due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products combined with the absence of the production issues in the first half of 2016 related to the implementation of new software and an increase in the specialty materials segment of 61 million  driven by an increase in corning gorilla glass and advanced optics products 

﻿ 

although core net earnings decreased in the year ended december 31 2017 core earnings per share increased 017 per share driven by lower weighted average shares outstanding due to repurchases of our common stock in 2017 

﻿ 

2016 vs 2015 

in the year ended december 31 2016 we generated core earnings of 1774 million  or 155 per share compared to 1882 million  or 140 per share in the year ended december 31 2015 the decrease was due to declines in the display technologies and environmental technologies segments slightly offsetting the decline was higher core earnings in the optical communications segment up 16 million  driven by higher sales volume in carrier network products the favorable translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates excluding the japanese yen and south korean won of 13 million and manufacturing efficiencies gained through cost reductions 

﻿ 

included in core earnings for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 is net periodic pen sion expense in the amount of 49 million  5 1 million and 62 million  respectively which excludes the annual pension markto market adjustments in the years ended december 31 2017  2016 and 2015  the marktomarket adjustments were a pre tax loss of 21 million  67 million and 165 million  respectively refer to note 13 employee retirement plans to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

reconciliation of nongaap measures 

we utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with gaap to assess our financial and operating performance a nongaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that i excludes amounts or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income or statement of cash flows or ii includes amounts or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income or statement of cash flows 

﻿ 

core net sales core equity in earnings of affiliated companies and core earnings are nongaap financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the company’s operations

reportable segments 

﻿ 

our reportable segments are as follows

﻿ 

all other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “all other” this group is primarily comprised of the results of the pharmaceutical technologies business and new product lines and development projects as well as certain corporate investments such as eurokera and keraglass equity affiliates 

﻿ 

we prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions we included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment’s net income we have allocated certain common expenses among our reportable segments differently than we would for standalone financial information prepared in accordance with gaap our reportable segments include nongaap measures which are not prepared in accordance with gaap we believe investors should consider these nongaap measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends these measures are not and should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap reporting measures for a reconciliation of nongaap performance measures to their most directly comparable gaap financial measure please see “reconciliation of nongaap measures” above segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements

off balance sheet arrangements 

﻿ 

off balance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 

﻿ 

corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include guarantee contracts at the time a guarantee is issued the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant 

﻿ 

refer to note 14 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

﻿ 

for variable interest entities we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of its expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests which are the ownership contractual or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests 

﻿ 

corning has identified ten entities that qualify as a variable interest entity these entities   are not considered to be significant to corning’s consolidated statements of position 

﻿ 

corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit liquidity or market risk support to that entity

we believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 

  

environment 

﻿ 

corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by the agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 corning had accrued approximately 38 million undiscounted  and  43 million undiscounted respectively for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote

critical accounting estimates 

﻿ 

the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates that required us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates are set forth below 

﻿ 

impairment of assets held for use 

﻿ 

we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified we review our longlived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 

﻿ 

manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals primarily platinum and rhodium these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of longlived assets this review considers all of the company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process in reclamation fabrication or refinement in anticipation of reuse or awaiting use to support increased capacity precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other nonmanufacturing related purposes 

﻿ 

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include but are not limited to 

﻿ 













﻿ 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities our assessment is performed at the reportable segment level for the majority of our reportable segments we concluded that locations or businesses within these segments which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

﻿ 

for longlived assets when impairment indicators are present we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used assessments also consider changes in asset utilization including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 

﻿ 

for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability the estimated fair value of longlived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of longlived assets and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value our estimates are based upon our historical experience our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate

at december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by 711 million and 890 million  respectively the majority of these precious metals are utilized by the display technologies and specialty materials segments corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments the potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments such events include but are not limited to a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our display technologies or specialty materials segments 

﻿ 

impairment of goodwill 

﻿ 

we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and our reporting units are the operating segments or the components of operating segments which constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management 

﻿ 

corning adopted asu 201704 intangibles – goodwill and other  on january 1 2017 which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the twostep impairment test the amendment requires an entity to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount an impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value 

  

corning has recorded goodwill in the display technologies optical communications  specialty materials life sciences and all other operating segments on a quarterly basis  or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may be impaired  management performs a qualitative assessment of factors in each reporting unit within these operating segments to determine if there have been any triggering events we also perform a detailed quantitative impairment test every three years if no indicators suggest a test should be performed in the interim we use this calculation as quantitative validation of the qualitative process this process does not represent an election to perform the quantitative impairment test in place of the qualitative review 

﻿ 

the following events and circumstances are considered when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 

﻿ 















﻿ 

the examples noted above are not allinclusive and the company will consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test 

﻿ 

our goodwill recoverability assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the longterm growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows our valuation method is an “income approach” using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return our estimates are based upon our historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends if the fair value is less than the carrying value a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the fair value and carrying value 

﻿ 

display technologies 

﻿ 

goodwill for the display technologies segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level consisting of two components for the purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment we have aggregated these two components into one reporting unit based upon their similar economic characteristics on a quarterly basis in 2017  management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the display technologies reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount 

© 2018 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

 

  

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit a discount rate of 58 and a growth rate of 1 were used in 2015 the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount and as such further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary we determined a range of discount rates between 38 and 78 and growth rates between 0 and 3 would not have affected our conclusion 

﻿ 

optical communications 

﻿ 

goodwill for the optical communications segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment leve l consisting of two components     for the purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment we have aggregated these two components into one reporting unit based upon their similar economic characteristics on a quarterly basis in 2017  management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the optical communications reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount 

﻿ 

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit a discount rate of 56 and a growth rate of 3 were used in 2015 the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount and as such further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary we determined a range of discount rates between 36 and 76 and growth rates between 0 and 3 would not have affected our conclusion 

﻿ 

specialty materials 

﻿ 

goodwill for the specialty materials segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is one level below an operating segment as the goodwill is the result of transactions associated with a certain business within this operating segment on a quarterly basis in 2017  management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the specialty materials reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount 

﻿ 

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit a discount rate of 58 and a growth rate of 3 were used in 2015 the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount and as such further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary we determined a range of discount rates between 38 and 78 and growth rates between 0 and 3 would not have affected our conclusion 

﻿ 

life sciences 

﻿ 

goodwill for the life sciences segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level on a quarterly basis in 2017  management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the life sciences reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount 

﻿ 

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit a discount rate of 6 and a growth rate of 3 were used in 2015 the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount and as such further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary we determined a range of discount rates between 4 and 8 and growth rates between 0 and 3 would not have affected our conclusion 

﻿ 

all other 

﻿ 

all other segment is comprised of various operating segments and corporate investments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting goodwill for the all other segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level for the purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment we have identified two reporting units in this segment that require an assessment of their goodwill on a quarterly basis in 2017  management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the reporting units’ fair value is less than the carrying amount 

﻿ 

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test s in 2015 a discount rate of 74 and a growth rate of 3 were used in 2015 the results of our impairment test indicated that the book value of one of the reporting units exceeded its fair value by 80 we determined a range of discount rates between 54 and 94 and growth rates between 0 and 3 would not have affected our conclusion corning concluded that a step 2 analysis was required to measure the impairment loss for this reporting unit 

﻿ 

© 2018 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

 

  

our step 2 test consisted of identifying the underlying net assets in the reporting unit allocating the implied purchase price to the asset and liabilities of the reporting unit and the calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill and the resulting impairment loss in december 201 5 we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of 29 million related to this reporting unit   

﻿ 

restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions 

﻿ 

we are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including for example employee termination costs restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses of portions thereof their profitability cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome the judgment involved can be difficult subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses 

﻿ 

restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which as a result require impairment we are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned 

﻿ 

income taxes 

﻿ 

we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environments in which we do business it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances 

﻿ 

corning accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc topic 740 income taxes  which requires that companies only record tax benefits for technical positions that are believe d to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement in estimating these amounts we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue a particular position or alternatively consider a negotiated compromise and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position as a result it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates 

﻿ 

at december 31 2017 corning has not completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 tax act pursuant to sab 118 the company has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on its us deferred tax balances the onetime toll charge and the impact on its state valuation allowances in addition corning has not made sufficient progress on estimating the impact of tax reform on its assertion   regarding its indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings so the company will continue to follow its historic position while it continues to analyze this issue   in addition corning’s accounting for the impact of the global intangible lowtaxed income gilti provisions of the 2017 tax act is incomplete and as a result it has not yet elected a policy to account for the gilti provisions 

﻿ 

the initial accounting is incomplete as we need additional time and information to analyze all aspects of the newly enacted law and how it impacts our worldwide operations   the additional information that needs to be obtained prepared or analyzed in order to complete the accounting requirements includes receiving further guidance from the tax authorities additional time to prepare basis calculations post enactment impacts and further time to validate of our assumptions 

﻿ 

equity method investments 

﻿ 

on may 31 2016 corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in dow corning pursuant to the transaction agreement announced on december 10 2015 under the terms of the transaction agreement corning exchanged with dow corning its 50 stock interest in dow corning for 100 of the stock of a newly formed entity which holds an equity interest in hemlock semiconductor group and approximately 48 billion in cash 

© 2018 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

 

  

the equity in earnings line on our income statement for the year ended december 31 2016 reflects the equity earnings from the silicones and polysilicones hemlock semiconductor businesses of dow corning from january 1 2016 through may 31 2016 the closing date of the transaction agreement and seven months of equity earnings from hemlock semiconductor group prior to the realignment of dow corning equity earnings from the hemlock semiconductor business were reported on the equity in earnings line in corning’s income statement net of dow corning’s 35 us tax additionally corning reported its tax on equity earnings from dow corning on the tax provision line on its income statement at a us tax provision rate of 7 as part of the realignment hemlock semiconductor group was converted to a partnership each of the partners is responsible for the taxes on their portion of equity earnings therefore postrealignment hemlock semiconductor group’s equity earnings is reported before tax on the equity in earnings line and corning’s tax is reported on the tax provision line 

﻿ 

at december 31 2017 and 2016  the carrying value of our equity method investment assets   was 280 million and  269 million respectively in addition we also have an equity investment hsg with a negative carrying value of 105 million the negative carrying value resulted from a onetime charge to this entity in 2014 for the permanent abandonment of certain assets we review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if events or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be otherthantemporarily impaired when such indicators are present we then perform an indepth review for impairment an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability forecasted tax rates foreign currency exchange rate movements terminal value assumptions historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends as of december 31 2017 and 2016  we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable 

﻿ 

fair value measures 

﻿ 

as required corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the company’s own market assumptions once inputs have been characterized we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement in addition observable market data must be used when available and the highestandbestuse measure should be applied to nonfinancial assets corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are shortterm and longterm investments certain pension asset investments and derivatives these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions 

﻿ 

derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities included in our forward exchange contracts are foreign currency hedges that hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the japanese yen south korean won  euro  new taiwan dollar and chinese yuan  these contracts are not designated as accounting hedges and changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings in the translated earnings contract loss gain net line of the consolidated statements of loss income in arriving at the fair value of corning’s derivative assets and liabilities we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction amounts related to credit risk are not material 

﻿ 

refer to note 16 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

﻿ 

probability of litigation outcomes 

﻿ 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter case law and other casespecific issues see part ii – item 3 legal proceedings for a discussion of corning’s material litigation matters 

﻿ 

other possible liabilities 

﻿ 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters including certain tax planning and environmental matters these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals

pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb 

﻿ 

corning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company’s assumptions related to general economic conditions particularly interest rates expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates the cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements mortality turnover and plan participation while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s employee pension and other postretirement obligations and current and future expense 

﻿ 

costs for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements 1 ongoing costs recognized quarterly which are comprised of service and interest costs expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs and 2 marktomarket gains and losses outside of the corridor where the corridor is equal to 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets at the beginning of the year which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year these gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment settlement or significant plan changes as well as any trueup to the annual valuation are recognized as a marktomarket adjustment in the quarter in which such event occurs 

﻿ 

costs for our opeb plans consist of ongoing costs recognized quarterly and are comprised of service and interest costs amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses we recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates as a component of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor 

﻿ 

prior to the december 31 2015 valuation of its defined benefit pension and opeb plans corning used the traditional single weightedaverage discount rate approach to develop the obligation interest cost and service cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its defined benefit pension and opeb plans the individual spot rates from the yield curve are used in measuring the pension plan projected benefit obligation pbo or opeb plan accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo at the measurement date the benefit obligation is effectively calculated as the aggregate present value at the measurement date of each future benefit payment related to past service with each payment discounted using a spot rate from a highquality corporate bond yield curve that matches the duration of the benefit payment under corning’s traditional single weightedaverage discount rate approach a single weightedaverage rate is developed from the approach described above and rounded to the nearest 25 basis points traditionally the weightedaverage discount rate is determined at the plan measurement date based on the same projected future benefit payments used in developing the benefit obligation the traditional single weightedaverage discount rate represents the constant annual rate that would be required to discount all future benefit payments related to past service from the date of expected future payment to the measurement date such that the aggregate present value equals the benefit obligation 

﻿ 

beginning with the december 31 2015 valuation of its defined benefit pen sion and opeb plans corning changed its methodology of determining the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs to a more granular approach under the new approach the cash flows from each applicable pension and opeb plan are used to directly calculate the benefit obligation service cost and interest cost using the spot rates from the applicable yield curve 

﻿ 

moving to a more granular approach has a limited impact on the determination of the respective benefit obligations the only impacts are as a result of the elimination of the rounding of the discount rate that occurred in the traditional approach and the use of specific cash flows for corning’s nonqualified pension plans while separately applying the yield curve to each separate opeb plan instead of aggregating the opeb plan cash flows for corning’s pension plans this change will increase the immediate recognition of actuarial losses or decrease the immediate recognition of actuarial gains due to corning’s previous election to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses outside of the corridor for corning’s opeb plans this change will increase the accumulated other comprehensive income aoci account balance due to the accumulation of lower actuarial gains or higher actuarial losses over time the amortization of the actuarial losses from aoci will begin to reduce the savings from the lower interest cost and service cost 

﻿ 

this change was a change in accounting estimate and therefore was applied prospectively beginning with the measurement date of december 31 2015 no restatement of prior periods is required

the following table presents our actual and expected return on assets as well as the corresponding perc entage for the years ended 2017  2016 and 2015  

﻿ 



﻿ 

as of december 31 2017  the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was  3519 million  

﻿ 

the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans 

﻿ 



﻿ 

the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning’s funding requirements

revenue recognition 

﻿ 

the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned in certain instances revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns allowances discounts and other factors these estimates are supported by historical data corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue on a completed contract basis revenues under the completedcontract method are recognized upon substantial completion defined as acceptance by the customer and compliance with performance specifications as agreed upon in the contract which in certain instances require s estimates and judgments in determining the timing of substantial completion of the contract while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning’s future results 

﻿ 

sharebased compensation 

﻿ 

sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates sharebased compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

﻿ 

we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects 

﻿ 





﻿ 

our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the japanese yen south korean won new taiwan dollar chinese yuan  and the euro we seek to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using overthecounter otc derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts in general these hedges expire coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions 

﻿ 

we are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts however we minimize this risk by maintaining a diverse group of highlyrated major international financial institutions as our counterparties we do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments 

﻿ 

our cash flow hedging activities utilize otc foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers we also use otc foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the undesignated hedges limit exposures to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies a significant portion of the company’s nonus revenues are denominated in japanese yen when these revenues are translated back to us dollars the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements in the japanese yen to protect translated earnings against movements in the japanese yen the company has entered into a series of average rate forwards and other derivative instruments  

﻿ 

we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 201 7  with respect to open foreign exchange forward and option contracts and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of  14 billion compared to  16 billion at december 31 201 6  specific to the japanese yen a 10 adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 1 266 million compared to 1458 million at december 31 2016 specific to the south korean won a 10 adverse movement in quoted south korean won exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 88 million compared to 79 million at december 31 2016 the company expects that these hypothetical losses from a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates on the derivative financial instruments should largely offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and future transactions being hedged 

﻿ 

because we derive approximately 69 of our net sales from outside the us our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies most notably the japanese yen south korean won and euro as an example of the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our financial results we compare 201 7 actual sales in yen won and euro transaction currencies at an average currency exchange rate during the year to a 10 change in the currency exchange rate a plus or minus 10  movement in the us dollar – japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2017 net sales of approximately 300 million  a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – south korean won and us dollar – euro exchange rates would result in a change to 2017 net sales of approximately 6 million and 96 million  respectively we estimate that a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2017 net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately 187 million  a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – south korean won and us dollar – euro exchange rates would result in a change to 2017 net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately 63 million and 5 million  respectively  

﻿ 

interest rate risk management 

﻿ 

to manage interest rate exposure the company from time to time enters into interest rate swap agreements we are currently party to two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of  550 million of previously issued fixed rate longterm debt to floating rate debt under the terms of the swap agreements we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the onemonth libor rate

certain key materials and proprietary equipment used in the manufacturing of products are currently solesourced or available only from a limited number of suppliers to minimize this risk corning closely monitors raw materials and equipment with limited availability or which are sourced through one supplier however any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components andor raw materials could result in lost sales due to delays or reductions in product shipments or reductions in cornings gross margins

patents and trademarks

inventions by members of cornings research and engineering staff continue to be important to the companys growth patents have been granted on many of these inventions in the united states and other countries some of these patents have been licensed to other manufacturers including companies in which corning has equity investments many of our earlier patents have now expired but corning continues to seek and obtain patents protecting its innovations in 2016 corning was granted about 460 patents in the us and over 1100 patents in countries outside the us

each business segment possesses a patent portfolio that provides certain competitive advantages in protecting cornings innovations corning has historically enforced and will continue to enforce its intellectual property rights at the end of 2016 corning and its whollyowned subsidiaries owned over 9660 unexpired patents in various countries of which over 3840 were us patents between 2017 and 2019 approximately 6 of these patents will expire while at the same time corning intends to seek patents protecting its newer innovations worldwide corning has about 10500 patent applications in process with about 2500 in process in the us corning believes that its patent portfolio will continue to provide a competitive advantage in protecting the companys innovation although cornings competitors in each of its businesses are actively seeking patent protection as well

while each of our reportable segments has numerous patents in various countries no one patent is considered material to any of these segments important usissued patents in our reportable segments include the following

 

 

 

 

 

products reported in all other include development projects new product lines and other businesses or investments that do not meet the threshold for separate reporting

approximate number of patents granted to our reportable segments follows

 

many of the companys patents are used in operations or are licensed for use by others and corning is licensed to use patents owned by others corning has entered into crosslicensing arrangements with some major competitors but the scope of such licenses has been limited to specific product areas or technologies

cornings principal trademarks include the following axygen corning celcor clearcurve duratrap eagle xg edge8 gorilla gosselin hpfs leaf pyrex steuben falcon smf28e unicam and willow

protection of the environment

corning has a program to ensure that its facilities are in compliance with state federal and foreign pollutioncontrol regulations this program has resulted in capital and operating expenditures each year in order to maintain compliance with such regulations capital expenditures for pollution control in operations were approximately 14 million in 2016 and are estimated to be 31 million in 2017

cornings 2016 consolidated operating results were charged with approximately 43 million for depreciation maintenance waste disposal and other operating expenses associated with pollution control corning believes that its compliance program will not place it at a competitive disadvantage

employees

at december 31 2016 corning had approximately 40700 fulltime employees from time to time corning also retains consultants independent contractors temporary and parttime workers

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in rapidly changing economic political and technological environments that present numerous risks many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows our ability to successfully execute our strategy and capital allocation framework and the trading price of our common stock or debt the following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends

as a global company we face many risks which could adversely impact our operations and reported financial results

we are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from and have significant operations outside of the united states our international operations include manufacturing assembly sales research and development customer support and shared administrative service centers

compliance with laws and regulations increases our costs we are subject to both us laws and local laws which among other things include data privacy requirements employment and labor laws tax laws anticompetition regulations prohibitions on payments to governmental officials import and trade restrictions and export requirements noncompliance or violations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks

we are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization including those related to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cornings display technologies segment generates a significant amount of the companys profits and cash flow any significant decrease in lcd glass pricing could have a material and negative impact on our financial results

cornings ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the profitability of our lcd glass business which is subject to continuous pricing pressure due to intense industry competition potential overcapacity and development of new technologies if we are not able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or sustain our current rate of cost reduction to offset potential pricing pressures it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results

because we have a concentrated customer base in each of our businesses our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or insolvency of one or more key customers as well as our ability to retain these customers

a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in our reportable segments mergers and consolidations between customers could result in further concentration of cornings customer base if further concentration occurs or a key customer becomes insolvent the loss of a key customer could result in a substantial loss of sales and reduction in anticipated in cash flows unforeseen events or actions on the part of corning could also result in the loss of customers resulting in further customer concentration

the following table details the number of combined customers of our segments that accounted for a large percentage of segment net sales

 

business disruptions could affect our operating results

a significant portion of our manufacturing research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas a major earthquake fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future financial results could be materially and adversely affected for example certain manufacturing sites require high quality continuous and uninterrupted power and access to industrial water unplanned outages could have a material negative impact on our operations and ability to supply our customers

additionally a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our reportable segments is concentrated in singlesite locations and it is reasonably possible that the operations of one or more such facilities could be disrupted due to the specialized nature of the assets it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from other facilities accordingly a disruption at a singlesite manufacturing operation could significantly impact cornings ability to supply its customers and could produce a nearterm severe impact on our individual businesses and the company as a whole

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights which could result in loss of market share and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others

we rely on patent and trade secret laws copyright trademark confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses we cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property worldwide may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of or the unauthorized use of our intellectual property potentially resulting in loss of market share litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are often unpredictable if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive

the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios we periodically receive notices from or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights andor breach of our agreements with them these third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design manufacture or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us

information technology dependency and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue liability claims or competitive harm

the company is dependent on information technology it systems and infrastructure for its business and manufacturing controls our it systems may be vulnerable to disruptions from human error outdated applications computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized access cyberattack and other similar disruptions any significant disruption breakdown intrusion interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could cause the loss of data equipment damage downtime andor safety related issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business like other global companies we have from time to time experienced incidents related to our it systems and expect that such incidents will continue including malware and computer virus attacks unauthorized access systems failures and disruptions we have measures and defenses in place against unauthorized access but we may not be able to prevent immediately detect or remediate such events a material breach in the security of our it systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets such disruptions or security breaches could result in the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information harm our competitive position disrupt our manufacturing reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business

additionally we believe that utilities and other operators of critical infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks including cyberattack in the event of such an attack disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power electrical gas etc

we may not earn a positive return from our research development and engineering investments

developing our products through our innovation model of research and development is expensive and often involves a long investment cycle we make significant expenditures and investments in research and development and four process engineering platforms that may earn an economic return if our investments do not provide a pipeline of new technologies that our customers demand or lower cost manufacturing platforms it could negatively impact our revenues and operating margins both near and longterm

we have significant exposure to foreign currency movements and to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio

a large portion of our sales profit and cash flows are transacted in nonus dollar currencies and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to these exposures we also maintain a significant portfolio of over the counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency exposure to the japanese yen new taiwan dollar south korean won chinese yuan and euro we are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows

for example we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our currency exposures or should we elect not to hedge certain currency exposures alternatively we may experience gains or losses if the underlying exposure which we have hedged change increases or decreases and we are unable to reverse unwind or terminate the hedges concurrent with the change in the underlying notional exposure

our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we enter into the exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors our hedge portfolio may reduce our flexibility to respond to price moves by our display technologies segment competitors

all of these factors could materially impact our results of operations anticipated future results financial position and cash flows the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control

if we are unable to obtain certain specialized equipment raw and batch materials or natural resources required in our products or processes our business will suffer

our ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of equipment parts and components from our suppliers we may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations there can be no assurances that we will not encounter problems in the future certain manufacturing equipment and components are available only from single or limited sources and we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner a reduction interruption or delay of supply or a significant increase in the price for supplies such as manufacturing equipment precious metals raw materials utilities including energy and industrial water could have a material adverse effect on our businesses

we use specialized raw materials from singlesource suppliers eg specific mines or quarries and natural resources eg helium in certain products and processes if a supplier is unable to provide the required raw materials or the natural resource is in scarce supply or not readily available we may be unable to change our product composition or manufacturing process in order to prevent a disruption to our business

we have incurred and may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges

at december 31 2016 corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of 24 billion while we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable we cannot provide assurance that additional impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe or if acquisitions and investments made by the company fail to achieve expected returns

changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations

our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors including

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may have additional tax liabilities

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made

a significant amount of our net profits and cash flows are generated from outside the us and certain repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that could significantly impact how us global corporations are taxed although we cannot predict whether or in what form proposed legislation may pass if enacted certain proposals could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow

our innovation model depends on our ability to attract and retain specialized experts in our core technologies

our innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science ceramic science and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities the loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering team without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance

we are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations

some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste waste water other industrial waste or greenhouse gases and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of such substances we have installed antipollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities we have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations however we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards

any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us or the suspensioncessation of production or operations in addition environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the us and other countries such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and co 2 abatement may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by among other things substantially increasing manufacturing costs limiting availability of scarce resources especially energy or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers

current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations

as described in legal proceedings in this form 10k we are engaged in litigation and regulatory matters litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain and adverse rulings could occur resulting in significant liabilities penalties or damages such current or future substantial legal liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations

 

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violation by an employee or the company may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our continued operation and expansion outside the united states including in developing countries could increase the risk of alleged violations violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition

moreover several of our related partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws rules and business practices that differ from those in the united states and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws rules and business practices

international trade policies may negatively impact our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the us

 

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas tariffs and capital controls whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us including our equity affiliatesjoint ventures from being able to sell andor manufacture products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a governments adoption of buy national policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations these policies also affect our equity companies

 item 3 legal proceedings 

nonpcc asbestos litigation corning is a defendant in cases alleging injuries from asbestos which had been stayed pending the confirmation of the pcc plan the stay was lifted on august 25 2016 for additional information and updates to estimated liabilities as of december 31 2016 see note 7 investments to the consolidated financial statements

environmental litigation corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 17 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by the agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is cornings policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 corning had accrued approximately 43 million undiscounted and 37 million undiscounted respectively for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the companys liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

organization of information

managements discussion and analysis provides a historical and prospective narrative on the companys financial condition and results of operations this discussion includes the following sections

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overview

strategy and capital allocation framework

in october 2015 corning announced a new strategy and capital allocation framework the framework that reflects the companys financial and operational strengths as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value the framework outlines our leadership priorities and articulates the opportunities we see across our businesses we designed the framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength under our framework we target generating 26 billion to 30 billion of cash through 2019 returning more than 125 billion to shareholders and investing 10 billion to sustain our leadership positions and deliver growth

our probability of success increases as we invest in our worldclass capabilities over the next three years corning will concentrate approximately 80 of its research development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies four manufacturing and engineering platforms and five marketaccess platforms this strategy will allow us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed

performance against the framework

since introducing the framework we have distributed approximately 6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends our board also approved a new 4 billion share repurchase authorization in december 2016 and annual dividend increases of 125 in 2016 and 148 in february 2017 as part of our ongoing commitment to return cash to our investors

within our portfolio we realigned our interest in dow corning which created significant value for shareholders including unlocking 48 billion in cash we strengthened our position in optical communications with two acquisitions to expand our access to various segments of the telecommunications market we also entered into a joint venture with saintgobain sekurit to develop automotive glazing solutions

we also utilized our financial strength in 2016 to continue our focus on innovation resulting in the launch of new products and traction with customers on key growth initiatives including

 

 

 

 

 

2016 results

our sales grew in total in 2016 driven by yearoveryear growth in most of our operating segments the first quarter was our weakest driven by a combination of slow demand in some markets and production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software which constrained our ability to manufacture product momentum built steadily throughout the year and our performance in the second half of 2016 was significantly improved from the first half

net sales in the year ended december 31 2016 were 9390 million an increase of 279 million or 3 when compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase was primarily driven by the display technologies segment and the corning pharmaceutical technologies business up 152 million and 84 million respectively the optical communications specialty materials and life sciences segments also increased up 25 million 17 million and 18 million respectively

for the year ended december 31 2016 we generated net income of 37 billion or 323 per share compared to net income of 13 billion or 100 per share for 2015 when compared to last year the 24 billion increase in net income was due to the following items amounts presented after tax

 

 

 

partially offsetting these events were the following items

 

 

 

 

the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected cornings consolidated net income in the year ended december 31 2016 in the amount of 229 million when compared to 2015 largely due to the strengthening of the japanese yen versus the us dollar this impact was more than offset by the decrease of 283 million in the realized gain from our foreign currency translation hedges

core performance measures

in managing the company and assessing our financial performance we supplement certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements with measures adjusted to exclude certain items to arrive at core performance measures we believe reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions corning has adopted the use of constant currency reporting for the japanese yen and south korean won and uses an internally derived yentodollar management rate of ¥99 and wontodollar management rate of ₩1100

net sales equity in earnings of affiliated companies and net income are adjusted to exclude the impacts of changes in the japanese yen and the south korean won gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts acquisitionrelated costs certain discrete tax items restructuring and restructuringrelated charges certain litigationrelated expenses pension marktomarket adjustments and other items which do not reflect ongoing operating results of the company or our equity affiliates managements discussion and analysis on our reportable segments has also been adjusted for these items as appropriate these measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap we believe investors should consider these nongaap measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends these measures are not and should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap reporting measures with respect to the companys outlooks for future periods it is not able to provide reconciliations for these nongaap measures because the company does not forecast the movement of the japanese yen and south korean won against the us dollar or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the companys control as a result the company is unable to provide outlook information on a gaap basis

core net sales

the following table presents core net sales by reportable segment in millions

 

in all segments except display technologies core net sales are consistent with gaap net sales because a significant portion of revenues in the display technologies segment are denominated in japanese yen this segments net sales are adjusted to remove the impact of translating yen into dollars as of january 1 2015 we use an internally derived management rate of ¥99 which is closely aligned to our current yendenominated hedges related to translated earnings and have recast all periods presented based on this rate in order to effectively remove the impact of changes in the japanese yen

core net sales decreased by 90 million in the year ended december 31 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 core net sales in the display technologies segment decreased by 218 million or 6 in the year ended december 31 2016 driven by lcd glass price declines slightly higher than 10 partially offset by an increase in volume of a midsingle digit percentage

core net sales decreased by 155 million to 98 billion in the year ended december 31 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014 the decline was driven by a decrease of 318 million in the display technologies segment primarily due to price declines in the lowteens on a percentage basis although volume increased in the midsingle digits in percentage terms growth was muted somewhat by weakness in demand for televisions computer monitors and mobile computing products

the translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates in the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 excluding the japanese yen and south korean won negatively affected core net sales in the amount of 39 million and 215 million respectively when compared to the prior years

as reported

2016 vs 2015

net sales in the specialty materials segment increased by 17 million or 2 in the year ended december 31 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 driven by an increase in sales of corning gorilla glass 5 and advanced optics products although corning gorilla glass sales were lower in the first three quarters of 2016 sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 increased approximately 22 over the same period last year led by the rapid adoption of corning gorilla glass 5 net income increased by 7 million or 4 driven by manufacturing cost reductions higher advanced optics sales and the impact of gorilla glass 5 offset slightly by higher research and development costs movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact net sales and net income in the specialty materials segment in the twelve months ended december 31 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015

2015 vs 2014

net sales for the year ended december 31 2015 decreased by 98 million or 8 when compared to the same period in 2014 primarily due to lower sales of advanced optics products this decline was driven by weakness in the semiconductor industry delays in a large aerospace and defense program and the depreciation of the euro versus the us dollar the translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales in the specialty materials segment in the amount of 12 million in 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014

when compared to the same period in 2014 the increase in net income of 29 million or 21 in the year ended december 31 2015 was driven by an increase in corning gorilla glass volume improvements in manufacturing efficiency and lower operating expenses gained through cost reductions offset somewhat by a decrease in sales of advanced optics products the translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates did not significantly impact net income of this segment in 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014

core performance

all other

all other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as all other this group is primarily comprised of the results of cornings pharmaceutical technologies business our nonlcd glass business new product lines and development projects as well as certain corporate investments such as eurokera and keraglass equity affiliates

the following table provides net sales and other data for all other in millions

 

2016 vs 2015

the increase in net sales of this segment in the year ended december 31 2016 reflects the impact of an acquisition in the corning pharmaceutical technologies business completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and an increase in sales in our emerging businesses the increase in the net loss of this segment was driven by asset writeoffs in emerging businesses offset slightly by the addition of the corning pharmaceutical technologies business net income

2015 vs 2014

the increase in net sales of this segment in the year ended december 31 2015 reflects the impact of an acquisition in the corning pharmaceutical technologies business completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and an increase in sales in our emerging businesses the slight increase in the net loss of this segment was driven by a goodwill impairment loss of 29 million offset by higher net income in the pharmaceutical technologies and corning precision materials nonlcd glass businesses

customer deposits

in december 2015 corning announced that with the support of the hefei government it will locate a gen 105 glass manufacturing facility in the hefei xinzhan general pilot zone in anhui province china glass substrate production from the new facility is expected to support mass production of lcd panels for largesize televisions beginning in 2018

as part of this investment corning and a chinese customer have entered into a longterm supply agreement that commits the customer to the purchase of gen 105 glass substrates from the corning manufacturing facility in hefei this agreement stipulates that the customer will provide a nonrefundable cash deposit in the amount of approximately 400 million to corning to secure rights to an amount of glass that is produced by corning over the next 10 years corning has collected the full amount of this deposit adjusted for foreign exchange movements receiving 185 million of this deposit in 2016 and 197 million in 2015 as glass is shipped to the customer corning will recognize revenue and issue credit memoranda to reduce the amount of the customer deposit liability which are applied against customer receivables resulting from the sale of glass in 2016 and 2015 there were no credit memoranda issued

capital spending

capital spending totaled 11 billion in 2016 slightly below the amount spent in 2015 spending in our display technologies and optical communications segments represented 41 and 22 respectively we expect our 2017 capital expenditures to be approximately 15 billion driven by expansions related to the gen 105 glass manufacturing facility in china the addition of capacity to support the new gasparticulate filters business in the environmental technologies segment and investment to support general business growth in the optical communications and specialty materials segments

cash flows

 

summary of cash flow data in millions

 

2016 vs 2015

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 288 million in the year ended december 31 2016 when compared to 2015 driven largely by a decrease in net income excluding noncash gains an increase in accounts receivable in the optical communications and specialty materials segments up 81 and 70 respectively partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities a decrease of 58 million in dividends received from equity affiliates driven by the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in dow corning also negatively impacted cash flow from operations

net cash provided by investing activities increased substantially up 4347 million in the year ended december 31 2016 when compared to 2015 driven by 4818 million in cash received upon the realignment of dow corning a decrease of 120 million in capital expenditures and a decrease of 399 million in acquisition spending partially offset by a decrease of 452 million in realized gains on our translated earnings contracts

net cash used in financing activities in the year ended december 31 2016 increased 2703 when compared to 2015 driven by an increase of 999 million in share repurchases the repayment of 481 million of commercial paper outstanding in 2015 and the absence of cash received from the issuance of longterm debt in the amount of 745 million in the third quarter of 2015

2015 vs 2014

net cash provided by operating activities decreased significantly in the year ended december 31 2015 when compared to the same period last year due to the absence of a special onetime dividend of 1574 million received from samsung corning precision materials in the first quarter of 2014 lower net income and cash outflows from working capital movements offset somewhat by the receipt of a 197 million customer deposit and the adjustment to net income related to gains on foreign currency hedges and other noncash operating adjustments cash outflows from working capital movements were largely driven by an increase in variable compensation paid in 2015 and an increase in inventory in the display technologies segment

net cash used in investing activities decreased in the year ended december 31 2015 when compared to the same period last year due to net liquidations of shortterm investments and an increase in realized gains on our translated earnings contracts offset by higher capital spending and several acquisitions that were completed in 2015

net cash used in financing activities in the year ended december 31 2015 increased slightly when compared to the same period last year driven by an increase in share repurchases and the absence of cash received from the issuance of preferred stock offset by proceeds received from the issuance of longterm debt and commercial paper

off balance sheet arrangements

off balance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements

cornings off balance sheet arrangements include guarantee contracts at the time a guarantee is issued the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant

refer to note 14 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

for variable interest entities we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses receives a majority of its expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests which are the ownership contractual or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entitys net assets excluding variable interests

corning has identified eleven entities that qualify as a variable interest entity these entities are not considered to be significant to cornings consolidated statements of position

corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit liquidity or market risk support to that entity

contractual obligations

the amounts of our obligations follow in millions

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are required at the time a guarantee is issued to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant

we believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded

environment

corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 17 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by the agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is cornings policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2016 and 2015 corning had accrued approximately 43 million undiscounted and 37 million undiscounted respectively for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the companys liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote

critical accounting estimates

the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates that required us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates are set forth below

impairment of assets held for use

we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified we review our longlived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred

manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals primarily platinum and rhodium these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of longlived assets this review considers all of the companys precious metals that are either in place in the production process in reclamation fabrication or refinement in anticipation of reuse or awaiting use to support increased capacity precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other nonmanufacturing related purposes

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include but are not limited to

 

 

 

 

 

 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for the majority of our reportable segments we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities

for longlived assets when impairment indicators are present we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the assets carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used assessments also consider changes in asset utilization including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets fair value and carrying value this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used

for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability the estimated fair value of longlived assets is determined using an income approach that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of longlived assets and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets fair value and carrying value our estimates are based upon our historical experience our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate

at december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by 890 million and 976 million respectively the majority of these precious metals are utilized by the display technologies and specialty materials segments corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments the potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments such events include but are not limited to a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our display technologies or specialty materials segments

impairment of goodwill

we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and our reporting units are the operating segments or the components of operating segments which constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management

corning has recorded goodwill in the display technologies optical communications specialty materials life sciences and all other operating segments on a quarterly basis management performs a qualitative assessment of factors in each reporting unit within these operating segments to determine whether there have been any triggering events the twostep impairment test is required only if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount we perform a detailed twostep process every three years if no indicators suggest a test should be performed in the interim we use this calculation as quantitative validation of the stepzero qualitative process that is performed during the intervening periods and does not represent an election to perform the twostep process in place of the stepzero review

the following summarizes our qualitative process to assess our goodwill balances for impairment

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the examples noted above are not allinclusive and the company will consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test

our twostep goodwill recoverability assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the longterm growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows our valuation method is an income approach using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return our estimates are based upon our historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends

display technologies

goodwill for the display technologies segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level consisting of two components for the purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment we have aggregated these two components into one reporting unit based upon their similar economic characteristics on a quarterly basis in 2016 management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the display technologies reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit a discount rate of 58 and a growth rate of 1 were used in 2015 the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount and as such further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary we determined a range of discount rates between 38 and 78 and growth rates between 0 and 3 would not have affected our conclusion

optical communications

goodwill for the optical communications segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level consisting of two components for the purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment we have aggregated these two components into one reporting unit based upon their similar economic characteristics on a quarterly basis in 2016 management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the optical communications reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit a discount rate of 56 and a growth rate of 3 were used in 2015 the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount and as such further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary we determined a range of discount rates between 36 and 76 and growth rates between 0 and 3 would not have affected our conclusion

specialty materials

 

goodwill for the specialty materials segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is one level below an operating segment as the goodwill is the result of transactions associated with a certain business within this operating segment on a quarterly basis in 2016 management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the specialty materials reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit a discount rate of 58 and a growth rate of 3 were used in 2015 the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount and as such further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary we determined a range of discount rates between 38 and 78 and growth rates between 0 and 3 would not have affected our conclusion

 

life sciences

goodwill for the life sciences segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level on a quarterly basis in 2016 management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the life sciences reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit a discount rate of 6 and a growth rate of 3 were used in 2015 the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount and as such further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary we determined a range of discount rates between 4 and 8 and growth rates between 0 and 3 would not have affected our conclusion

all other

all other segment is comprised of various operating segments and corporate investments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting goodwill for the all other segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level for the purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment we have identified two reporting units in this segment that require an assessment of their goodwill on a quarterly basis in 2016 management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the reporting units fair value is less than the carrying amount

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit a discount rate of 74 and a growth rate of 3 were used in 2015 the results of our impairment test indicated that the book value of one of the reporting units exceeded its fair value by 80 we determined a range of discount rates between 54 and 94 and growth rates between 0 and 3 would not have affected our conclusion corning concluded that a step 2 analysis was required to measure the impairment loss for this reporting unit

our step 2 test consisted of identifying the underlying net assets in the reporting unit allocating the implied purchase price to the asset and liabilities of the reporting unit and the calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill and the resulting impairment loss in december 2015 we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of 29 million related to this reporting unit

restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions

we are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including for example employee termination costs restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses of portions thereof their profitability cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome the judgment involved can be difficult subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses

restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which as a result require impairment we are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned

income taxes

we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environments in which we do business it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances

corning accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb asc topic 740 income taxes as required under fasb asc topic 740 we only record tax benefits for technical positions that we believe have a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement in estimating these amounts we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue a particular position or alternatively consider a negotiated compromise and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position as a result it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates

equity method investments

on may 31 2016 corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in dow corning pursuant to the transaction agreement announced on december 10 2015 under the terms of the transaction agreement corning exchanged with dow corning its 50 stock interest in dow corning for 100 of the stock of a newly formed entity which holds an equity interest in hemlock semiconductor group and approximately 48 billion in cash

the equity in earnings line on our income statement for the year ended december 31 2016 reflects both the equity earnings from the silicones and polysilicones hemlock semiconductor businesses of dow corning from january 1 2016 through may 31 2016 the closing date of the transaction agreement and seven months of equity earnings from hemlock semiconductor group prior to the realignment of dow corning equity earnings from the hemlock semiconductor business were reported on the equity in earnings line in cornings income statement net of dow cornings 35 us tax additionally corning reported its tax on equity earnings from dow corning on the tax provision line on its income statement at a us tax provision rate of 7 as part of the realignment hemlock semiconductor group was converted to a partnership each of the partners is responsible for the taxes on their portion of equity earnings therefore postrealignment hemlock semiconductor groups equity earnings is reported before tax on the equity in earnings line and cornings tax is reported on the tax provision line

at december 31 2016 and 2015 the carrying value of our equity method investments was 269 million and 19 billion respectively we review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if events or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be otherthantemporarily impaired when such indicators are present we then perform an indepth review for impairment an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability forecasted tax rates foreign currency exchange rate movements terminal value assumptions historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends as of december 31 2016 and 2015 we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable

fair value measures

as required corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the companys own market assumptions once inputs have been characterized we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement in addition observable market data must be used when available and the highestandbestuse measure should be applied to nonfinancial assets cornings major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are shortterm and longterm investments certain pension asset investments and derivatives these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions

derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities included in our forward exchange contracts are foreign currency hedges that hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the japanese yen south korean won euro new taiwan dollar and chinese yuan these contracts are not designated as accounting hedges and changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings in the translated earnings contract loss gain net line of the consolidated statements of income in arriving at the fair value of cornings derivative assets and liabilities we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction amounts related to credit risk are not material

refer to note 16 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

probability of litigation outcomes

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter case law and other casespecific issues see part ii – item 3 legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face

other possible liabilities

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters including certain tax planning and environmental matters these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals

pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb

corning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the companys assumptions related to general economic conditions particularly interest rates expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates the cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements mortality turnover and plan participation while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect cornings employee pension and other postretirement obligations and current and future expense

costs for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements 1 ongoing costs recognized quarterly which are comprised of service and interest costs expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs and 2 marktomarket gains and losses outside of the corridor where the corridor is equal to 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets at the beginning of the year which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year these gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment settlement or significant plan changes as well as any trueup to the annual valuation are recognized as a marktomarket adjustment in the quarter in which such event occurs

costs for our opeb plans consist of ongoing costs recognized quarterly and are comprised of service and interest costs amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses we recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates as a component of stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor

prior to the december 31 2015 valuation of its defined benefit pension and opeb plans corning used the traditional single weightedaverage discount rate approach to develop the obligation interest cost and service cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its defined benefit pension and opeb plans the individual spot rates from the yield curve are used in measuring the pension plan projected benefit obligation pbo or opeb plan accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo at the measurement date the benefit obligation is effectively calculated as the aggregate present value at the measurement date of each future benefit payment related to past service with each payment discounted using a spot rate from a highquality corporate bond yield curve that matches the duration of the benefit payment under cornings traditional single weightedaverage discount rate approach a single weightedaverage rate is developed from the approach described above and rounded to the nearest 25 basis points traditionally the weightedaverage discount rate is determined at the plan measurement date based on the same projected future benefit payments used in developing the benefit obligation the traditional single weightedaverage discount rate represents the constant annual rate that would be required to discount all future benefit payments related to past service from the date of expected future payment to the measurement date such that the aggregate present value equals the benefit obligation

beginning with the december 31 2015 valuation of its defined benefit pension and opeb plans corning changed its methodology of determining the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs to a more granular approach under the new approach the cash flows from each applicable pension and opeb plan are used to directly calculate the benefit obligation service cost and interest cost using the spot rates from the applicable yield curve

moving to a more granular approach has a limited impact on the determination of the respective benefit obligations the only impacts are as a result of the elimination of the rounding of the discount rate that occurred in the traditional approach and the use of specific cash flows for cornings nonqualified pension plans while separately applying the yield curve to each separate opeb plan instead of aggregating the opeb plan cash flows this change will result in a decrease in the interest cost and service cost components of net periodic pension and opeb costs for the year ended december 31 2017 net periodic pension and opeb costs will be lower by approximately 23 million and 5 million respectively due to this change for cornings pension plans this change will increase the immediate recognition of actuarial losses or decrease the immediate recognition of actuarial gains due to cornings previous election to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses outside of the corridor for cornings opeb plans this change will increase the accumulated other comprehensive income aoci account balance due to the accumulation of lower actuarial gains or higher actuarial losses over time the amortization of the actuarial losses from aoci will begin to reduce the savings from the lower interest cost and service cost

this change was a change in accounting estimate and therefore was applied prospectively beginning with the measurement date of december 31 2015 no restatement of prior periods is required

the following table presents our actual and expected return on assets as well as the corresponding percentage for the years ended 2016 2015 and 2014

 

as of december 31 2016 the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was 3289 million

the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans

 

the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear these changes in assumptions would have no effect on cornings funding requirements

in addition at december 31 2016 a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would decrease stockholders equity by 117 million before tax and a 25 basis point increase in each spot rate would increase stockholders equity by 111 million in addition the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in each spot rate assumption related to cornings us opeb plans

 

 

the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear

revenue recognition

the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned in certain instances revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns allowances discounts and other factors these estimates are supported by historical data corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue on a completed contract basis revenues under the completedcontract method are recognized upon substantial completion defined as acceptance by the customer and compliance with performance specifications as agreed upon in the contract which in certain instances require estimates and judgments in determining the timing of substantial completion of the contract while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect cornings future results

sharebased compensation

sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates sharebased compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted

forwardlooking statements

the statements in this annual report on form 10k in reports subsequently filed by corning with the securities and exchange commission sec on form 10q and form 8k and related comments by management that are not historical facts or information and contain words such as will believe anticipate expect intend plan seek see would and target and similar expressions are forwardlooking statements such statements relate to future events that by their nature address matters that are to different degrees uncertain these forwardlooking statements relate to among other things the companys future operating performance the companys share of new and existing markets the companys revenue and earnings growth rates the companys ability to innovate and commercialize new products and the companys implementation of costreduction initiatives and measures to improve pricing including the optimization of the companys manufacturing capacity

although the company believes that these forwardlooking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions regarding among other things current estimates and forecasts general economic conditions its knowledge of its business and key performance indicators that impact the company actual results could differ materially the company does not undertake to update forwardlooking statements some of the risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects

 

 

our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the japanese yen south korean won new taiwan dollar chinese yuan and the euro we seek to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using overthecounter otc derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts in general these hedges expire coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions

we are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts however we minimize this risk by maintaining a diverse group of highlyrated major international financial institutions as our counterparties we do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments

our cash flow hedging activities utilize otc foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers we also use otc foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the undesignated hedges limit exposures to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries monetary assets monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies a significant portion of the companys nonus revenues are denominated in japanese yen when these revenues are translated back to us dollars the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements in the japanese yen to protect translated earnings against movements in the japanese yen the company has entered into a series of zero cost collars and average rate forwards

we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2016 with respect to open foreign exchange forward and option contracts and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 1618 million compared to 901 million at december 31 2015 specific to the japanese yen a 10 adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 1458 million compared to 741 million at december 31 2015 specific to the south korean won a 10 adverse movement in quoted south korean won exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 79 million compared to 99 million at december 31 2015 the company expects that these hypothetical losses from a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates on the derivative financial instruments should largely offset gains and losses on the assets liabilities and future transactions being hedged

because we derive approximately 72 of our net sales from outside the us our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies most notably the japanese yen south korean won and euro as an example of the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our financial results we compare 2016 actual sales in yen won and euro transaction currencies at an average currency exchange rate during the year to a 10 change in the currency exchange rate a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2016 net sales of approximately 328 million a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – south korean won and us dollar – euro exchange rates would result in a change to 2016 net sales of approximately 5 million and 80 million respectively we estimate that a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2016 net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately 201 million a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – south korean won and us dollar – euro exchange rates would result in a change to 2016 net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately 65 million and 6 million respectively

interest rate risk management

it is our policy to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates to manage interest rate exposure the company from time to time enters into interest rate swap agreements we are currently party to two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of 550 million of previously issued fixed rate longterm debt to floating rate debt under the terms of the swap agreements we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the onemonth libor rate

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock or debt the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

as a global company we face many risks which could adversely impact our ongoing operations and reported financial results 

we are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from and have significant operations outside of the united states our international operations include manufacturing assembly sales research and development customer support and shared administrative service centers 

compliance with laws and regulations increases our costs these laws and regulations include us laws and local laws which include data privacy requirements employment and labor laws tax laws anticompetition regulations prohibitions on payments to governmental officials import and trade restrictions and export requirements noncompliance or violations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks 

we are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization including those related to

our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions of one or more key customers or the circumstances to which they are subject leading to the substantial reduction in orders for our products 

in 2015 corning’s ten largest customers accounted for 45 of our sales 

a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in our reportable segments for 2015 three customers of the display technologies segment accounted for 62 of total segment net sales when combined in the optical communications segment in 2015 two customers accounted for 22 of total segment net sales when combined in the environmental technologies segment in 2015 three customers accounted for 86 of total segment sales in aggregate in the specialty materials segment three customers accounted for 56 of total segment sales in 2015 when combined in the life sciences segment two customers accounted for 46 of total segment sales in 2015 in aggregate as a result of mergers and consolidations between customers corning’s customer base could become more concentrated 

our optical communications segment customers’ purchases of our products are affected by their capital expansion plans general market and economic uncertainty and regulatory changes including broadband policy sales in the optical communications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of fibertothepremises deployments and data center expansions our sales will be dependent on planned targets for homes passed and connected and construction of new andor expansion of existing data centers changes in our customers’ deployment plans could adversely affect future sales 

in the environmental technologies segment sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for automotive and diesel emissions tend to fluctuate with vehicle production changes in laws and regulations for air quality and emission controls may also influence future sales sales in our environmental technologies segment are mainly to three catalyzers and emission system control manufacturers our customers sell these systems to automobile and diesel engine original equipment manufacturers sales in this segment may be affected by adverse developments in the global vehicle or freight hauling industries or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicle sales or downturns in freight traffic 

certain sales in our specialty materials segment track worldwide economic cycles and our customers’ responses to those cycles in addition any positive trends in prior years in the sales of strengthened glass may not continue we may experience losses relating to our inability to supply contracted quantities of this glass and processes planned to produce new versions of this glass may not be successful 

sales in our life sciences segment are concentrated with two large distributors who are also competitors and the balance is to a variety of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies hospitals universities and other research facilities changes in our distribution arrangements in this segment may adversely affect this segment’s financial results 

our operations and financial performance could be negatively impacted if the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies evolving industry or regulatory standards and new product introductions our success is dependent on the successful introduction of new products or upgrades of current products and our ability to compete with new technologies the following factors related to our products and markets if they do not continue as in the recent past could have an adverse impact on our operations

we face pricing pressures in each of our businesses that could adversely affect our financial performance 

we face pricing pressure in each of our businesses as a result of intense competition emerging technologies or overcapacity we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or sustain our current rate of cost reduction to offset pricing pressures we anticipate pricing pressures will continue in the future in all our businesses 

any of these items could cause our sales profitability and cash flows to be significantly reduced 

we face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations 

because we have significant customers and operations outside the us fluctuations in foreign currencies especially the japanese yen new taiwan dollar south korean won and euro will significantly impact our sales profit and cash flows foreign exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the us dollar and japanese yen sales in our display technologies segment representing 34 of corning’s sales in 2015 are denominated in japanese yen corning hedges significant translation transaction and balance sheet currency exposures and uses a variety of derivative instruments to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities as well as operating results including our net profits 

a large portion of our sales profit and cash flows are transacted in nonus dollar currencies and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to these exposures net of gains or losses from our hedging programs for example we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures or should we elect not to hedge certain foreign currency exposures alternatively we may experience gains or losses if the underlying exposure which we have hedged change increases or decreases and we are unable to reverse unwind or terminate the hedges concurrent with the change in the underlying notional exposure the objective of our hedging activities is to mitigate the risk associated with foreign currency exposures we are also exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors all of these factors could materially impact our results of operations anticipated future results financial position and cash flows the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control 

if the financial condition of our customers declines our credit risks could increase 

we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable if our customers or our indirect customers fail to meet their payment obligations for our products we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amounts reserved many customers of our display technologies and specialty materials segments are thinly capitalized andor unprofitable in our optical communications segment certain large infrastructure projects are subject to governmental funding which if terminated could adversely impact the financial strength of our customers these factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business 

the success of our business depends on our ability to develop and produce advantaged products that meet our customers’ needs 

  

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our customers original equipment manufacturers and distributors this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to manage and maintain key customer relationships our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers the manufacturing of our products involves complex and precise processes in some cases existing manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the requirements of our customers we will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to maintain profitable operations while we continue to fund projects to improve our manufacturing techniques and processes and lower our costs we may not achieve satisfactory manufacturing costs that will fully enable us to meet our profitability targets

in addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on our ability to innovate with respect to both products and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations failure to continue to deliver quality and competitive products to the marketplace to adequately protect our intellectual property rights to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our future financial performance depends on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials precious metals parts and manufacturing equipment to meet the demands of our customers 

our ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials precious metals parts and components from our suppliers we may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations there can be no assurances that we will not encounter problems in the future furthermore certain manufacturing equipment raw materials or components are available only from a single source or limited sources we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner a reduction interruption or delay of supply or a significant increase in the price for supplies such as manufacturing equipment precious metals raw materials or energy could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

if our products including materials purchased from our suppliers experience performance issues our business will suffer 

our business depends on the production of products of consistently high quality our products components and materials purchased from our suppliers are typically tested for quality these testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios for various reasons our products including materials purchased from our suppliers may fail to perform as a customer expected in some cases product redesigns or additional expense may be required to address such issues a significant or systemic quality issue could result in customer relations problems lost sales reduced volumes product recalls and financial damages and penalties 

we have incurred and may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 

at december 31 2015 corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of 2086 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a charge of 29 million for the impairment of goodwill resulting from a small acquisition in 2014 while we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable we cannot provide assurance that additional impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe or if acquisitions and investments made by the company fail to achieve expected returns 

we operate in a highly competitive environment 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on the company’s share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace the company competes on the basis of product attributes customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties product performance failures our failure to price our products competitively our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or unexpected emerging technologies or products we expect that we will face continuous competition from existing competitors low cost manufacturers and new entrants we believe we must invest in research and development engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities and continue to improve customer service in order to remain competitive we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position 

we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses particularly lcd glass and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices if our competitors offer significant discounts on certain products or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to retain our customers and market positions any such changes may reduce our profitability and cash flow any broadbased change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as we implement and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies if we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand our revenues could decrease

lcd glass generates a significant amount of the company’s profits and cash flow and any events that adversely affect the market for lcd glass substrates could have a material and negative impact on our financial results 

corning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the level of profitability of our lcd glass business as a result any event that adversely affects our display business could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial results these events could include loss of patent protection increased costs associated with manufacturing and increased competition from the introduction of new and more desirable products if any of these events had a material adverse effect on the sales of our lcd glass such an event could result in material charges and a significant reduction in profitability 

additionally emerging material technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications including display glass cover glass and others resulting in a decline in demand for our products existing or new production capacity for glass substrates may exceed the demand for them technologies for displays cover glass and other applications in competition with our glass may reduce or eliminate the need for our glass substrates new process technologies developed by our competitors may also place us at a cost or quality disadvantage our own process technologies may be acquired or used unlawfully by others enabling them to compete with us our inability to manufacture glass substrates to the specifications required by our customers may result in loss of revenue margins and profits or liabilities for failure to supply a scarcity of resources limitations on technology personnel or other factors resulting in a failure to produce commercial quantities of glass substrates could have adverse financial consequences to us 

changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

a significant amount of our net profits and cash flows are generated from outside the us and certain repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that could significantly impact how us global corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form proposed legislation may pass if enacted certain antideferral proposals could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow 

our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees 

the loss of the services of any member of our senior management team or key research and development or engineering personnel without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance

we are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations 

some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste waste water other industrial waste or greenhouse gases and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of such substances we have installed antipollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities we have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations however we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps toward adopting more stringent environmental standards 

any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us or the suspensioncessation of production or operations in addition environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the us and other countries such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and co 2 abatement may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by among other things substantially increasing manufacturing costs limiting availability of scarce resources especially energy or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers 

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights which could result in loss of market share and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on patent and trade secret laws copyright trademark confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses we cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property worldwide may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of or the unauthorized use of our intellectual property potentially resulting in loss of market share litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are often unpredictable if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive 

the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios we periodically receive notices from or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights andor breach of our agreements with them these third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design manufacture or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us 

current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations 

as described in legal proceedings in this form 10k we are engaged in litigation and regulatory matters litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain and adverse rulings could occur resulting in significant liabilities penalties or damages such current or future substantial legal liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

we may not capture significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all 

developing our products through research and development is expensive and the investment often involves a long return on investment cycle we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by increases in our gross margin we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position

corning index 

business disruptions could affect our operating results 

a significant portion of our manufacturing research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas a major earthquake fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

additionally a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our display technologies segment is concentrated in three overseas countries and it is reasonably possible that the operations of one or more such facilities could be disrupted due to the specialized nature of the assets and the customers’ locations it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from facilities in other countries accordingly loss of these facilities could produce a nearterm severe impact on our display business and the company as a whole 

we face risks through equity affiliates that we do not control 

corning’s net income includes equity earnings from affiliated companies for the year ended december 31 2015 we recognized 299 million of equity earnings of which approximately 94 came from dow corning which makes silicone and high purity polycrystalline products 

on december 11 2015 corning announced its intention to exchange its 50 equity interest in dow corning for 100 of the stock of a newly formed entity that will become a whollyowned subsidiary of corning incorporated the newly formed entity will hold approximately 40 ownership in hemlock semiconductor group and approximately 48 billion in cash upon completion of this strategic realignment which is expected to close during the first half of 2016 dow chemical an equal owner of dow corning with corning since 1943   will assume 100 ownership of dow corning 

going forward we face the risk that our other equity investments may not perform at the levels expected in addition we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards or regulations may adversely affect us 

we may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us 

we face the risk of loss resulting from product liability asbestos securities fiduciary liability intellectual property antitrust contractual warranty environmental fraud and other lawsuits whether or not such claims are valid in addition our product liability fiduciary directors and officers property policies including business interruption natural catastrophe and comprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect in the future a successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us to make substantial unplanned payments some of the carriers in our historical primary and excess insurance programs are in liquidation and may not be able to respond if we should have claims reaching their policies the financial health of other insurers may deteriorate several of our insurance carriers are litigating with us the extent if any of their obligation to provide insurance coverage for asbestos liabilities asserted against us the results of that litigation may adversely affect our insurance coverage for those risks in addition we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain types of risk such as political risks terrorism or war 

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our continued operation and expansion outside the united states including in developing countries could increase the risk of alleged violations violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

© 2016 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

  

corning index 

moreover several of our related partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws rules and business practices that differ from those in the united states and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws rules and business practices 

acquisitions equity investments and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business 

we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into equity investments and strategic alliances as part of our business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that a transaction may not advance our business strategy that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment or that we experience difficulty integrating new employees business systems and technology or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits such as increased revenue and cash flow enhanced efficiencies or market share or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized these events could harm our operating results or financial condition 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation 

we store and process personallyidentifiable information of our employees and in some case our customers at the same time the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of the increasingly hostile information security environment this environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies despite these efforts it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

significant macroeconomic events changes in regulations or a crisis in the financial markets could limit our access to capital 

we utilize credit in both the capital markets and from banks to facilitate company borrowings hedging transactions leases and other financial transactions we maintain a 2 billion revolving credit agreement to fund potential liquidity needs and to backstop certain transactions an adverse macroeconomic event or changes in bank regulations could limit our ability to gain access to credit or to renew the revolving credit agreement upon expiration additionally a financial markets crisis may limit our ability to access liquidity 

adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our cash investments 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various types of securities with varying maturities and credit quality these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that have affected global financial markets we also make significant investments in us government securities either directly or through investment in money market funds if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline or if the us defaults on its debt obligations or its debt is downgraded our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely impact our financial results 

information technology dependency and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue liability claims or competitive harm 

the company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure any significant breakdown intrusion interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business like other global companies we have from time to time experienced incidents related to our information technology “it” systems and expect that such incidents will continue including malware and computer virus attacks unauthorized access systems failures and disruptions we have measures and defenses in place against unauthorized access but we may not be able to prevent immediately detect or remediate such events

corning index 

we use electronic it in our manufacturing processes and operations and other aspects of our business our it systems may be vulnerable to disruptions from computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized access cyberattack and other similar disruptions a material breach in the security of our it systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets such disruptions or security breaches could result in the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business 

additionally utilities and other operators of critical energy infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks including cyberattack in the event of such an attack disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power electrical gas etc 

international trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position 

  

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us including our equity affiliatesjoint ventures from being able to sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations these policies also affect our equity companies

 item 3 legal proceedings 

dow corning corporation corning and dow chemical each own 50 of the common stock of dow corning 

dow corning breast implant litigation 

in may 1995 dow corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousands of breast implant product lawsuits on june 1 2004 dow corning emerged from chapter 11 with a plan of reorganization the “plan” which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims the plan also includes releases for corning and dow chemical as shareholders in exchange for contributions to the plan 

under the terms of the plan dow corning has established and is funding a settlement trust and a litigation facility to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate their claims inclusive of insurance dow corning has paid approximately 18 billion to the settlement trust as of december 31 2015 dow corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of 291 million see note 7 investments to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

other dow corning claims arising from bankruptcy proceedings 

as a separate matter arising from the bankruptcy proceedings dow corning is defending claims asserted by a number of commercial creditors who claim additional interest at default rates and enforcement costs during the period from may 1995 through june 2004 as of december 31 2015 dow corning has estimated the liability to commercial creditors to be within the range of 104 million to 341 million as dow corning management believes no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range dow corning has recorded the minimum liability within the range should dow corning not prevail in this matter corning’s equity earnings would be reduced by its 50 share of the amount in excess of 104 million net of applicable tax benefits there are a number of other claims in the bankruptcy proceedings against dow corning awaiting resolution by the us district court and it is reasonably possible that dow corning may record bankruptcyrelated charges in the future the remaining tort claims against dow corning are expected to be channeled by the plan into facilities established by the plan or otherwise defended by the litigation facility 

pittsburgh corning corporation and asbestos litigation corning and ppg industries inc “ppg” each own 50 of the capital stock of pittsburgh corning corporation “pcc” over a period of more than two decades pcc and several other defendants were named in numerous lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos on april 16 2000 pcc filed for chapter 11 reorganization in the us bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania at the time pcc filed for bankruptcy protection there were approximately 11800 claims pending against corning in state court lawsuits alleging various theories of liability based on exposure to pcc’s asbestos products and typically requesting monetary damages in excess of one million dollars per claim corning has defended those claims on the basis of the separate corporate status of pcc and the absence of any facts supporting claims of direct liability arising from pcc’s asbestos products 

pcc plan of reorganization 

corning with other relevant parties has been involved in ongoing efforts to develop a plan of reorganization that would resolve the concerns and objections of the relevant courts and parties on november 12 2013 the bankruptcy court issued a decision finally confirming an amended pcc plan of reorganization the “amended pcc plan” or the “plan” on september 30 2014 the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania the “district court” affirmed the bankruptcy court’s decision confirming the amended pcc plan on october 30 2014 one of the objectors to the plan appealed the district court’s affirmation of the plan to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit the “third circuit court of appeals” on january 6 2016 all pending appeals of the plan were withdrawn and corning expects that the plan will become effective in april 2016 

under the plan as affirmed by the bankruptcy court and affirmed by the district court corning is required to contribute its equity interests in pcc and pittsburgh corning europe nv “pce” a belgian corporation and to contribute 290 million in a fixed series of payments recorded at present value corning will contribute its equity interest in pcc and pce on the plan’s funding effective date which is expected to occur in june 2016 corning has the option to use its common stock rather than cash to make these payments but the liability is fixed by dollar value and not the number of shares the plan requires corning to make 1 one payment of 70 million one year from the date the plan becomes effective and certain conditions are met and 2 five additional payments of 35 million 50 million 35 million 50 million and 50 million respectively on each of the five subsequent anniversaries of the first payment the final payment of which is subject to reduction based on the application of credits under certain circumstances

nonpcc asbestos litigation 

in addition to the claims against corning related to its ownership interest in pcc corning is also the defendant in approximately 9700 other cases approximately 37300 claims alleging injuries from asbestos related to its corhart business and similar amounts of monetary damages per case the “nonpcc asbestos claims” when pcc filed for bankruptcy protection the court granted a preliminary injunction to suspend all asbestos cases against pcc ppg and corning – including these nonpcc asbestos claims the “stay” the stay remains in place as of the date of this filing however given that the amended pcc plan is now affirmed by the district court and the third circuit court of appeals corning anticipates the stay will be lifted in the second half of 2016 these nonpcc asbestos claims have been covered by insurance without material impact to corning to date as of december 31 2015 corning had received for these claims approximately 19 million in insurance payments when the stay is lifted these nonpcc asbestos claims will be allowed to proceed against corning in prior periods corning recorded in its estimated asbestos litigation liability an additional 150 million for these and any future nonpcc asbestos claims 

total estimated liability for the amended pcc plan and the nonpcc asbestos claims 

the liability for the amended pcc plan and the nonpcc asbestos claims was estimated to be 678 million at december 31 2015 compared with an estimate of liability of 681 million at december 31 2014 the 678 million liability is comprised of 238 million of the fair value of pce 290 million for the fixed series of payments and 150 million for the nonpcc asbestos claims all referenced in the preceding paragraphs with respect to the pce liability at december 31 2015 and 2014 the fair value of 238 million and 241 million of our interest in pce significantly exceeded its carrying value of 154 million and 162 million respectively there have been no impairment indicators for our investment in pce and we continue to recognize equity earnings of this affiliate at the time corning recorded this liability it determined it lacked the ability to recover the carrying amount of its investment in pcc and its investment was other than temporarily impaired as a result we reduced our investment in pcc to zero as the fair value in pce is significantly higher than book value management believes that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than the fair value of the liability is remote with respect to the liability for other asbestos litigation the liability for nonpcc asbestos claims was estimated based upon industry data for asbestos claims since corning does not have recent claim history due to the stay issued by the bankruptcy court the estimated liability represents the undiscounted projection of claims and related legal fees over the next 20 years the amount may need to be adjusted in future periods as more data becomes available however we cannot estimate any additional losses at this time for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 corning recorded asbestos litigation income of 15 million and expense of 9 million respectively at december 31 2015 440 million of the obligation consisting of the 290 million for the fixed series of payments and 150 million for the nonpcc asbestos claims is classified as a noncurrent liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than 12 months after the amended pcc plan becomes effective the amount of the obligation related to the fair value of pce 238 million was reclassified to a current liability in the fourth quarter of 2015 as the contribution of the assets is expected to be made within the next twelve months 

nonpcc asbestos claims insurance litigation 

several of corning’s insurers have commenced litigation in state courts for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies including rights that may be affected by the potential resolutions described above corning has resolved these issues with a majority of its relevant insurers and is vigorously contesting these cases with the remaining relevant insurers management is unable to predict the outcome of the litigation with these remaining insurers 

environmental litigation corning has been named by the united states environmental protection agency the “epa” under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 17 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by the epa are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the epa agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2015 and 2014 corning had accrued approximately 37 million undiscounted and 43 million undiscounted respectively for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote

overview 

strategy and capital allocation framework 

in october 2015 corning announced a new strategy and capital allocation framework that reflects the company’s financial and operational strengths as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value 

our probability of success increases as we invest in our worldclass capabilities over the next four years corning will concentrate approximately 80 of its research development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies four manufacturing and engineering platforms and five marketaccess platforms this strategy will allow us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed 

our financial strength also allows us to increase our return to shareholders through 2019 we expect to generate and deploy over 20 billion in cash and to return more than 10 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as a result we expect to increase our dividend per common share by at least 10 annually through 2019 

investing in our future 

corning is one of the world’s leading innovators in materials science for more than 160 years corning has applied its unparalleled expertise in specialty glass ceramics and optical physics to develop products that have created new industries and transformed people’s lives our spending level for research development and engineering remained consistent at 8 of sales in the year ended december 31 2015 when compared to the year ended december 31 2014 we continue to maintain our innovation strategy focusing on growing our existing businesses developing opportunities adjacent or closely related to our existing technical and manufacturing capabilities and investing in longrange opportunities in each of our market segments we continue to work on new products including glass substrates for highperformance displays and lcd applications precision glass for advanced displays emission control products for cars trucks and offroad vehicles products that accelerate drug discovery and manufacturing and the optical fiber cable and hardware and equipment that enable fibertothepremises and next generation data centers in addition we are focusing on wireless solutions for diverse venue applications such as distributed antenna systems we have also focused our research development and engineering spending to support the advancement of new product attributes for our corning gorilla glass suite of products including gorilla glass® in automotive and architectural markets we will continue to focus on adjacent glass opportunities which leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes including corning® willow™ glass our ultraslim flexible glass substrate for use in nextgeneration consumer electronic and architectural applications 

2015 results 

the global economic headwinds the continued softening in the television and consumer electronic device retail markets and the negative impact of the strengthening of the us dollar negatively impacted corning in 2015 resulting in lower net sales and net income when compared to results in 2014

corning index 

net sales in the year ended december 31 2015 were 9111 million a decrease of 604 million or 6 when compared to the year ended december 31 2014 sales in our optical communications segment increased by 328 million or 12 but were more than offset by declines in our other segments the increase in sales in the optical communications segment was due to an increase in volume in north america in both carrier network and enterprise network products and the impact of several acquisitions completed in 2015 the decrease in sales of 765 million or 20 in the display technologies segment was the most significant segment decline and was driven by the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the us dollar in the amount of 446 million and price declines in the lowteens in percentage terms partially offset by a midsingle digit increase in volume 

for the year ended december 31 2015 we generated net income of 13 billion or 100 per share compared to net income of 25 billion or 173 per share for 2014 when compared to last year the decrease in net income was due to the following items amounts presented after tax 

 

 

 

 

the decrease in net income for the year ended december 31 2015 was partially offset by the following items 

 

 

 

the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected corning’s consolidated net income in the year ended december 31 2015 in the amount of 294 million when compared to 2014 this impact was partially offset by the increase in the realized gain from our foreign currency translation hedges related to translated earnings of 186 million 

2016 corporate outlook 

in 2016 corning expects its display technologies segment to experience continued moderate sequential lcd glass price declines and glass volume growth in the midsingle digit percentage year over year in line with total glass demand growth we anticipate that a rise in global demand for corning’s carrier and enterprise network products will drive an increase in sales of a midsingle digit percentage in our optical communications segment and that an increase in corning gorilla glass and advanced optics volume will drive sales growth in the lowteens on a percentage basis in our specialty materials segment we expect sales in our environmental technologies segment to be down slightly for the year driven by lower yearoveryear demand for heavyduty diesel products and we expect to continue the execution of our strategy and capital allocation framework begun in the fourth quarter of 2015 under which we plan to grow and sustain our leadership position in the markets in which we operate and return more than 10 billion to shareholders through 2019

selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2014 increased by 85 million when compared to 2013 the increase was largely driven by the consolidation of corning precision materials which added 90 million an increase in pension expense of approximately 27 million an increase of 38 million in sharebased and performancebased compensation expenses and an increase of approximately 90 million in acquisitionrelated costs including 72 million of postcombination compensation expense offset somewhat by the positive impact of a contingent consideration fair value adjustment of 249 million as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses were 12 considerably lower than the same period in 2013 largely due to the contingent consideration fair value adjustment more than offsetting the increase in selling general and administrative expenses resulting from the acquisition of samsung corning precision materials

research development and engineering expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2015 research development and engineering expenses decreased by 46 million when compared to the same period last year driven by lower variable compensation and a decrease in the display technologies and specialty materials segments as a percentage of net sales research development and engineering expenses remained consistent with the same period in 2014

foreign currency hedge gain net 

included in the line item foreign currency hedge gain net is the impact of foreign currency hedges which hedge our translation exposure arising from movements in the japanese yen south korean won and euro against the us dollar and its impact on our net earnings as well as other foreign exchange hedges that limit exposures to foreign functional currency fluctuations the following tables provide detailed information on the impact of our foreign currency hedge gains and losses 

 

 

the gross notional value outstanding for our foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings at december 31 2015 is 119 billion and is comprised of the following 1 japanese yendenominated hedges  83 billion 2 south korean wondenominated hedges  33 billion and 3 eurodenominated hedges  345 million 

income before income taxes 

the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected corning’s income before income taxes in the year ended december 31 2015 in the amount of 388 million when compared to 2014 this impact was partially offset by the increase in the realized gain from our foreign currency translation hedges related to translated earnings of 379 million 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows dollars in millions 

 

© 2016 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

  

corning index 

the effective income tax rate for 2015 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

 

 

 

 

 

  

the effective income tax rate for 2014 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

 

 

partially offsetting the benefits above is a 177 million charge attributable to a change in judgment on the realizability of certain foreign deferred tax assets in germany and japan 

corning has valuation allowances on certain shorterlived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss and state tax net operating loss carryforwards as well as other foreign net operating loss carryforwards because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character or amount required to utilize these assets before they expire the amount of us and foreign deferred tax assets that have remaining valuation allowances at december 31 2015 and 2014 was 238 million and 298 million respectively 

corning continues to indefinitely reinvest substantially all of its foreign earnings with the exception of an immaterial amount of current earnings that have very low or no tax cost associated with their repatriation our current analysis indicates that we have sufficient us liquidity including borrowing capacity to fund foreseeable us cash needs without requiring the repatriation of foreign cash one time or unusual items that may impact our ability or intent to keep our foreign earnings and cash indefinitely reinvested include significant us acquisitions stock repurchases shareholder dividends changes in tax laws derivative contract settlements or the development of tax planning ideas that allow us to repatriate earnings at minimal or no tax cost andor a change in our circumstances or economic conditions that negatively impact our ability to borrow or otherwise fund us needs from existing us sources as of december 31 2015 taxes have not been provided on approximately 11 billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings that are expected to remain invested indefinitely while it remains impracticable to calculate the tax cost of repatriating our total unremitted foreign earnings such cost could be material to the results of operations of corning in a particular period 

our foreign subsidiary in taiwan operates under various tax holiday arrangements the nature and extent of such arrangements vary and the benefits of such arrangements phase out through 2018 the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 05 04 and 12 percentage points for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

while we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next 12 months we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position

net income attributable to corning incorporated 

as a result of the items discussed above net income and per share data was as follows in millions except per share amounts 

 

 

comprehensive income 

 

2015 vs 2014 

for the year ended december 31 2015 comprehensive income decreased by 286 million when compared to the same period in 2014 driven by a decrease of 1133 million in net income attributable to corning incorporated offset by the positive impact of the change in foreign currency translation adjustments and the increase in unamortized gains for postretirement benefit plans 

the decrease in the loss on foreign currency translation adjustments for the year ended december 31 2015 in the amount of 483 million aftertax was driven by the following items 1 the decrease in the loss in the translation of corning’s consolidated subsidiaries in the amount of 334 million 2 the decrease in the loss in the translation of corning’s equity method investments in the amount of 13 million and 3 the absence of the reclassification of a gain to net income in 2014 in the amount of 136 million related to the acquisition of samsung corning precision materials 

the increase in unamortized gains for postretirement benefit plans in the amount of 402 million aftertax is due to the following 1 the increase in the reclassification to the income statement of 81 million of actuarial losses in our defined benefit pension plans largely driven by lower investment returns 2 a decrease in actuarial losses of 119 million and 3 the increase in actuarial gains of 202 million from our equity affiliate dow corning 

2014 vs 2013 

for the year ended december 31 2014 comprehensive income decreased by 528 million when compared to the same period in 2013 driven by an increase in unamortized losses for postretirement benefit plans and the negative impact of the change in foreign currency translation adjustments offset by an increase of 511 million in net income attributable to corning incorporated 

© 2016 corning incorporated all rights reserved 

  

corning index 

the increase in unamortized losses for postretirement benefit plans in the amount of 673 million is driven mainly by changes to the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to value corning’s us pension and postretirement medical and life benefit plan “opeb” obligations and the benefit plan obligations of our equity affiliate dow corning at december 31 2014 corning and dow corning adopted the society of actuaries mortality table rp2014 published in october 2014 along with an updated improvement scale and the discount rate for our us benefit plans decreased between 75 and 100 basis points at december 31 2014 the decrease in discount rates and the change in the mortality assumption for our us plans led to an actuarial aftertax loss of approximately 281 million versus a gain in 2013 of 392 million the loss of 281 million occurring in 2014 included the impact to our us pension and opeb plans from the mortality table change in the amount of 88 million the impact of 89 million from changes in other actuarial assumptions and 124 million from our equity affiliate dow corning offset by reclassifications to the income statement of 20 million aftertax related to us nonqualified and international pension plans because the actuarial loss for our us qualified pension plan did not fall outside of the corridor which is defined as equal to 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets at the beginning of the year it was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” and did not impact net income for the year ended december 31 2014 

the increase in the loss on foreign currency translation adjustments for the year ended december 31 2014 in the amount of 391 million was driven by the following items 1 the increase in the loss in the translation of corning’s consolidated subsidiaries in the amount of 65 million which resulted primarily from the depreciation of the japanese yen to us dollar translation rate during 2014 2 the increase in the loss in the translation of corning’s equity method investments in the amount of 190 million and 3 the reclassification of a gain to net income in the amount of 136 million related to the acquisition of samsung corning precision materials

core net sales core equity earnings of affiliated companies and core earnings are nongaap financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the company’s operations 

the following tables reconcile our nongaap financial measures to their most directly comparable gaap financial measure

core earnings in the display technologies segment in the year ended december 31 2015 declined by 168 million or 14 when compared to the same period last year volume increases in the midsingle digits in percentage terms lower manufacturing costs and a decline in operating expenses were more than offset by price declines in the lowteens and the absence of a gain on the settlement of an intellectual property dispute recorded in 2014 in the amount of 38 million 

2014 vs 2013 

when compared to the same period last year the increase in core net sales of 1585 million or 63 in the year ended december 31 2014 was due to the acquisition of the remaining equity interests of our affiliate samsung corning precision materials and the consolidation of this entity which added 19 billion in net sales this impact was somewhat offset by price declines in the midteens in percentage terms which more than offset an increase in volume that was slightly more than 10 in percentage terms 

core earnings in the display technologies segment increased by 110 million or 10 in the year ended december 31 2014 when compared to the same period last year the increase was driven by the positive impact of the acquisition of corning precision materials and the resulting cost reductions gained through synergies coupled with improvements in manufacturing efficiency of 46 million partially offset by the impact of price declines in the midteens in percentage terms that more than offset the increase in volume

other information 

the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan south korea china and taiwan in 2015 three customers of the display technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for a combined 62 of total segment sales in 2014 three customers of the display technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for a combined 61 of total segment sales in 2013 four customers of the display technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for a combined 94 of total segment sales our customers face the same global economic dynamics as we do in this market our nearterm sales and profitability would be impacted if any of these significant customers were unable to continue to purchase our products 

in addition prior to consolidation samsung corning precision materials’ sales were concentrated across a small number of its customers in 2013 sales to two lcd panel makers located in south korea accounted for approximately 93 of samsung corning precision materials sales 

corning has invested to expand capacity to meet the projected demand for lcd glass substrates in 2015 2014 and 2013 capital spending in this segment was 594 million 492 million and 350 million respectively we expect capital spending for 2016 to be approximately 600 million 

2016 outlook 

in the first quarter of 2016 corning anticipates that panel maker utilization will continue to decline which will reduce inventory levels in the supply chain as a result the overall glass market and corning’s lcd glass volume are expected to decline by a midtohigh singledigit percentage sequentially corning’s lcd glass price decline is expected to be moderate achieving what will be one of the lowest firstquarter declines in five years 

for the full year corning expects moderate sequential price declines to continue and for its glass volume to grow by a midsingledigit percentage year over year in line with total glass demand growth corning expects global television unit sales will grow by a low singledigit percentage and the average screen size will increase by at least 15 inches the company expects panel maker utilization to increase as the year progresses and retail lcd glass area demand to be up by a high singledigit percentage in 2016

net cash provided by operating activities decreased significantly in the year ended december 31 2015 when compared to the same period last year due to the absence of a special onetime dividend of 1574 million received from samsung corning precision materials in the first quarter of 2014 lower net income and cash outflows from working capital movements offset somewhat by the receipt of a 197 million customer deposit and the adjustment to net income related to gains on foreign currency hedges and other noncash operating adjustments cash outflows from working capital movements were largely driven by an increase in variable compensation paid in 2015 and an increase in inventory in the display technologies segment 

net cash used in investing activities decreased in the year ended december 31 2015 when compared to the same period last year due to net liquidations of shortterm investments and an increase in realized gains on our foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings offset by higher capital spending and several acquisitions that were completed in 2015 

net cash used in financing activities in the year ended december 31 2015 increased slightly when compared to the same period last year driven by an increase in share repurchases and the absence of cash received from the issuance of preferred stock offset by proceeds received from the issuance of longterm debt and commercial paper 

2014 vs 2013 

net cash provided by operating activities increased significantly in the year ended december 31 2014 when compared to the same period last year due to a dividend of approximately 1574 million received from samsung corning precision materials an increase in net income of 511 million and the cash inflows from inventory movements although net inventory increased by 52 million due to the acquisition of samsung corning precision materials which added 121 million this inventory was acquired through the issuance of preferred stock cash outflows for inventory declined by 120 million in the display technologies and specialty materials segments in 2014 when compared to 2013 offset somewhat by an increase of approximately 50 million driven by spending for new business development and increases in the optical communications and life sciences segments 

net cash used in investing activities decreased slightly in the year ended december 31 2014 when compared to the same period last year driven by a decrease in investments in unconsolidated entities the realized gains on our yendenominated purchased collars and the absence of the premium paid for our yendenominated purchased collars in 2013 offset by an increase in shortterm investments 

net cash used in financing activities in the year ended december 31 2014 increased when compared to the same period last year driven by our share repurchase programs and the absence of the proceeds received in 2013 from the issuance of longterm debt somewhat offset by cash received from the issuance of preferred stock and the absence of the retirement of longterm debt in the first quarter of 2013

off balance sheet arrangements 

off balance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 

corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include guarantee contracts at the time a guarantee is issued the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant 

refer to note 14 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

for variable interest entities we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of its expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests which are the ownership contractual or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests 

corning has identified one entity that qualifies as a variable interest entity this entity is not considered to be significant to corning’s consolidated statements of position 

corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit liquidity or market risk support to that entity

we are required at the time a guarantee is issued to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant 

we believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 

environment 

corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 17 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by the agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2015 and 2014 corning had accrued approximately 37 million undiscounted and 43 million undiscounted respectively for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates that required us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates are set forth below 

impairment of assets held for use 

we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified we review our longlived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 

manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals primarily platinum and rhodium these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of longlived assets this review considers all of the company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process in reclamation fabrication or refinement in anticipation of reuse or awaiting use to support increased capacity precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other nonmanufacturing related purposes 

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include but are not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for the majority of our reportable segments we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

for longlived assets when impairment indicators are present we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used assessments also consider changes in asset utilization including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 

for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability described above the estimated fair value of longlived assets is determined using an “income approach” “market approach” “cost approach” or a combination of one or more of these approaches as appropriate for the particular asset group being reviewed all of these approaches start with the forecast of expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of longlived assets and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals if appropriate for the asset group being reviewed some of the more significant estimates and assumptions in our analysis include market size and growth market share projected selling prices manufacturing cost and discount rate our estimates are based upon our historical experience our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate

corning index 

in the event the current net book value of an asset group is found to be greater than the net present value of the cash flows derived from the asset group we determine the actual fair market value of longlived assets with the assistance from valuation appraisals conducted by third parties the results of these valuations generally represent the fair market value of the asset group that will remain after any necessary impairment adjustments have been recorded the impairment charge will be allocated to assets within the asset group on a relative fair value basis 

at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by 976 million and 222 million respectively these precious metals are utilized by the display technologies and specialty materials segments corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments the potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments such events include but are not limited to a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our display technologies or specialty materials segments 

impairment of goodwill 

we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and our reporting units are the operating segments or the components of operating segments which constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management 

corning has recorded goodwill in the display technologies optical communications specialty materials life sciences and all other operating segments on a quarterly basis management performs a qualitative assessment of factors in each reporting unit within these operating segments to determine whether there have been any triggering events the twostep impairment test is required only if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount we perform a detailed twostep process every three years if no indicators suggest a test should be performed in the interim we use this calculation as quantitative validation of the stepzero qualitative process that is performed during the intervening periods and does not represent an election to perform the twostep process in place of the stepzero review 

the following summarizes our qualitative process to assess our goodwill balances for impairment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the examples noted above are not allinclusive and the company will consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test 

our twostep goodwill recoverability assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the longterm growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows our valuation method is an “income approach” using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return our estimates are based upon our historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends

display technologies 

goodwill for the display technologies segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level consisting of two components for the purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment we have aggregated these two components into one reporting unit based upon their similar economic characteristics on a quarterly basis in 2015 management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the display technologies reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount 

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit a discount rate of 58 and a growth rate of 1 were used in 2015 the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount and as such further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary we determined a range of discount rates between 38 and 78 and growth rates between 0 and 3 would not have affected our conclusion 

optical communications 

goodwill for the optical communications segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level consisting of two components for the purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment we have aggregated these two components into one reporting unit based upon their similar economic characteristics on a quarterly basis in 2015 management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the optical communications reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount 

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit a discount rate of 56 and a growth rate of 3 were used in 2015 the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount and as such further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary we determined a range of discount rates between 36 and 76 and growth rates between 0 and 3 would not have affected our conclusion 

specialty materials 

goodwill for the specialty materials segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is one level below an operating segment as the goodwill is the result of transactions associated with a certain business within this operating segment on a quarterly basis in 2015 management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the specialty materials reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount 

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit a discount rate of 58 and a growth rate of 3 were used in 2015 the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount and as such further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary we determined a range of discount rates between 38 and 78 and growth rates between 0 and 3 would not have affected our conclusion 

life sciences 

goodwill for the life sciences segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level on a quarterly basis in 2015 management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the life sciences reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount 

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit a discount rate of 6 and a growth rate of 3 were used in 2015 the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount and as such further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary we determined a range of discount rates between 4 and 8 and growth rates between 0 and 3 would not have affected our conclusion

all other 

all other segment is comprised of various operating segments and corporate investments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting goodwill for the all other segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level for the purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment we have identified two reporting units in this segment that require an assessment of their goodwill on a quarterly basis in 2015 management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the reporting units’ fair value is less than the carrying amount 

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit a discount rate of 74 and a growth rate of 3 were used in 2015 the results of our impairment test indicated that the book value of one of the reporting units exceeded its fair value by 80 we determined a range of discount rates between 54 and 94 and growth rates between 0 and 3 would not have affected our conclusion corning concluded that a step 2 analysis was required to measure the impairment loss for this reporting unit 

our step 2 test consisted of identifying the underlying net assets in the reporting unit allocating the implied purchase price to the asset and liabilities of the reporting unit and the calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill and the resulting impairment loss in december 2015 we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of 29 million related to this reporting unit 

restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions 

we are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including for example employee termination costs restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses of portions thereof their profitability cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome the judgment involved can be difficult subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses 

restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which as a result require impairment we are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned 

income taxes 

we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environments in which we do business it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances 

corning accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb asc topic 740 income taxes as required under fasb asc topic 740 we only record tax benefits for technical positions that we believe have a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement in estimating these amounts we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue a particular position or alternatively consider a negotiated compromise and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position as a result it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates

in october 2013 corning announced that it was entering into a series of strategic and financial agreements with samsung display which would result in corning obtaining full ownership of samsung corning precision materials as part of this agreement in the fourth quarter of 2013 corning acquired the minority interests of three shareholders in samsung corning precision materials for 506 million which included payment for the transfer of nonoperating assets and the prorata portion of cash on samsung corning precision materials balance sheet at september 30 2013 the resulting transfer of shares to corning increased corning’s ownership percentage of samsung corning precision materials from 50 to 575 because this transaction did not result in a change in control based on the governing articles of this entity corning did not consolidate this entity as of december 31 2013 the remaining transactions were completed on january 15 2014 which increased corning’s ownership to 100 and resulted in consolidation of the entity beginning in the first quarter of 2014 this organization was integrated into corning’s display technologies segment in 2014 refer to note 8 acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

on december 11 2015 corning announced its intention to exchange its 50 equity interest in dow corning corporation for 100 of the stock of a newly formed entity that will become a whollyowned subsidiary of corning incorporated the newly formed entity will hold approximately 40 ownership in hemlock semiconductor group and approximately 48 billion in cash upon completion of this strategic realignment which is expected to close during the first half of 2016 dow chemical an equal owner of dow corning with corning since 1943   will assume 100 ownership of dow corning 

at december 31 2015 and 2014 the carrying value of our equity method investments was 19 billion and 18 billion respectively with our largest equity method investment dow corning comprising 78 and 74 respectively of the balance we review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if events or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be otherthantemporarily impaired when such indicators are present we then perform an indepth review for impairment an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability forecasted tax rates foreign currency exchange rate movements terminal value assumptions historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable 

fair value measures 

as required corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the company’s own market assumptions once inputs have been characterized we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement in addition observable market data must be used when available and the highestandbestuse measure should be applied to nonfinancial assets corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are shortterm and longterm investments certain pension asset investments and derivatives these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions 

derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities included in our forward exchange contracts are foreign currency hedges that hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the japanese yen south korean won and euro these contracts are not designated as accounting hedges and changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings in the foreign currency hedge gain net line of the consolidated statements of income in arriving at the fair value of corning’s derivative assets and liabilities we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction amounts related to credit risk are not material

as a result of the acquisition of samsung corning precision materials in january 2014 the company has contingent consideration that was measured using unobservable level 3 inputs this contingent consideration arrangement potentially requires additional consideration to be paid between the parties in 2018 one based on projections of future revenues generated by the business of corning precision materials for the period between the acquisition date and december 31 2017 which is subject to a cap of 665 million and another based on the volumes of certain sales during the same period which is subject to a separate cap of 100 million the fair value of the potential receipt of the contingent consideration in 2018 in the amount of 196 million recognized on the acquisition date was estimated by applying an option pricing model using the company’s projection of future revenues generated by corning precision materials changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration in future periods are valued using an option pricing model and are recorded in corning’s results in the period of the change 

on december 29 2015 corning and samsung display entered into an agreement pursuant to which corning exchanged the amount of contingent consideration in excess of 300 million net present fair value 246 million as consideration for the incremental fair value associated with a number of commercial agreements including the amendment of its longterm supply agreement with samsung display as of december 29 2015 the net present fair value of the contingent consideration receivable was 458 million the net present fair value of the commercial benefit associated with the amended longterm supply agreement exceeds the value exchanged by corning pursuant to this agreement net present fair value 212 million consequently corning reclassified this amount to the other asset line of the consolidated balance sheet and will amortize the amount over the remaining term of the longterm supply agreement as a reduction in revenue 

additionally as a result of the acquisitions of ibwave solutions inc and the fiberoptics business of samsung electronics co ltd in the first quarter of 2015 the company has contingent consideration that was measured using unobservable level 3 inputs as of december 31 2015 the fair value of the contingent consideration payable is 10 million 

there were no significant financial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 

probability of litigation outcomes 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter case law and other casespecific issues see part ii – item 3 legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face the most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability including the inherent complexity of a chapter 11 filing our history of success in defending asbestos claims our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses and our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants’ representatives the proposed asbestos resolution amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies as noted in part ii – item 3 legal proceedings the district court’s affirmation of the amended pcc plan faces objections by certain parties for these and other reasons corning’s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters the estimate of the cost of resolving the nonpcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning’s financial statements is remote 

other possible liabilities 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters including certain tax planning and environmental matters these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 

pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb 

corning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company’s assumptions related to general economic conditions particularly interest rates expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates the cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements mortality turnover and plan participation while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s employee pension and other postretirement obligations and current and future expense

corning index 

costs for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements 1 ongoing costs recognized quarterly which are comprised of service and interest costs expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs and 2 marktomarket gains and losses outside of the corridor where the corridor is equal to 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets at the beginning of the year which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year these gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment settlement or significant plan changes as well as any trueup to the annual valuation are recognized as a marktomarket adjustment in the quarter in which such event occurs 

costs for our opeb plans consist of ongoing costs recognized quarterly and are comprised of service and interest costs amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses we recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates as a component of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor 

prior to the december 31 2015 valuation of its defined benefit pension and opeb plans corning used the traditional single weightedaverage discount rate approach to develop the obligation interest cost and service cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its defined benefit pension and opeb plans the individual spot rates from the yield curve are used in measuring the pension plan projected benefit obligation pbo or opeb plan accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo at the measurement date the benefit obligation is effectively calculated as the aggregate present value at the measurement date of each future benefit payment related to past service with each payment discounted using a spot rate from a highquality corporate bond yield curve that matches the duration of the benefit payment under corning’s traditional single weightedaverage discount rate approach a single weightedaverage rate is developed from the approach described above and rounded to the nearest 25 basis points traditionally the weightedaverage discount rate is determined at the plan measurement date based on the same projected future benefit payments used in developing the benefit obligation the traditional single weightedaverage discount rate represents the constant annual rate that would be required to discount all future benefit payments related to past service from the date of expected future payment to the measurement date such that the aggregate present value equals the benefit obligation 

beginning with the december 31 2015 valuation of its defined benefit pension and opeb plans corning is changing its methodology of determining the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs to a more granular approach under the new approach the cash flows from each applicable pension and opeb plan are used to directly calculate the benefit obligation service cost and interest cost using the spot rates from the applicable yield curve 

moving to a more granular approach has a limited impact on the determination of the respective benefit obligations the only impacts will be as a result of the elimination of the rounding of the discount rate that occurred in the traditional approach and the use of specific cash flows for corning’s nonqualified pension plans while separately applying the yield curve to each separate opeb plan instead of aggregating the opeb plan cash flows this change will result in a decrease in the interest cost and service cost components of net periodic pension and opeb costs for the year ended december 31 2016 net periodic pension and opeb costs will be lower by approximately 28 million and 6 million respectively due to this change for corning’s pension plans this change will increase the immediate recognition of actuarial losses or decrease the immediate recognition of actuarial gains due to corning’s previous election to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses outside of the corridor for corning’s opeb plans this change will increase the accumulated other comprehensive income aoci account balance due to the accumulation of lower actuarial gains or higher actuarial losses over time the amortization of the actuarial losses from aoci will begin to reduce the savings from the lower interest cost and service cost 

this change is a change in accounting estimate and therefore applied prospectively beginning with the next measurement date of december 31 2015 no restatement of prior periods is required

the following table presents our actual and expected return on assets as well as the corresponding percentage for the years ended 2015 2014 and 2013 

 

as of december 31 2015 the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was 3161 million 

the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans 

 

the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning’s funding requirements 

in addition at december 31 2015 a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would decrease stockholders’ equity by 110 million before tax and a 25 basis point increase in each spot rate would increase stockholders’ equity by 105 million in addition the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in each spot rate assumption related to corning’s us opeb plans 

 

 

the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned in certain instances revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns allowances discounts and other factors these estimates are supported by historical data corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue on a completed contract basis revenues under the completedcontract method are recognized upon substantial completion defined as acceptance by the customer and compliance with performance specifications as agreed upon in the contract which in certain instances require estimates and judgments in determining the timing of substantial completion of the contract while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning’s future results 

sharebased compensation 

sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates sharebased compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects 

 

 

our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the japanese yen south korean won new taiwan dollar chinese renminbi and the euro we seek to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using overthecounter otc derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts in general these hedges expire coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions 

we are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts however we minimize this risk by maintaining a diverse group of highlyrated major international financial institutions with which we have other financial relationships as our counterparties we do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments 

our cash flow hedging activities utilize otc foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers we also use otc foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the undesignated hedges limit exposures to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies a significant portion of the company’s nonus revenues are denominated in japanese yen when these revenues are translated back to us dollars the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements in the japanese yen to protect translated earnings against movements in the japanese yen the company has entered into a series of purchased collars and average rate forwards 

we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2015 with respect to open foreign exchange forward and option contracts and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 901 million compared to 1080 million at december 31 2014 specific to the japanese yen a 10 adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 741 million compared to 959 million at december 31 2014 specific to the south korean won a 10 adverse movement in quoted south korean won exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 99 million compared to 79 million at december 31 2014 

because we derive approximately 70 of our net sales from outside the us our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies most notably the japanese yen south korean won and euro our forecasts generally assume exchange rates during 2016 will remain constant at january 2016 levels as an example of the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our financial results we compare 2015 actual sales in yen won and euro transaction currencies at an average currency exchange rate during the year to a 10 change in the currency exchange rate a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2015 net sales of approximately 309 million a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – south korean won and us dollar – euro exchange rates would result in a change to 2015 net sales of approximately 5 million and 92 million respectively we estimate that a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2015 net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately 188 million a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – south korean won and us dollar – euro exchange rates would result in a change to 2015 net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately 67 million and 22 million respectively

interest rate risk management 

it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates to manage interest rate exposure the company from time to time enters into interest rate swap agreements we are currently party to two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of 550 million of previously issued fixed rate longterm debt to floating rate debt under the terms of the swap agreements we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the onemonth libor rate

 item 1 business 

general 

corning traces its origins to a glass business established in 1851 the present corporation was incorporated in the state of new york in december 1936 the company’s name was changed from corning glass works to corning incorporated on april 28 1989 

corning incorporated is a world leader in the manufacture of specialty glass and ceramics drawing on more than 160 years of materials science and process engineering knowledge corning creates and makes keystone components that enable hightechnology systems for consumer electronics mobile emissions control optical communications and life sciences corning operates in five reportable segments display technologies optical communications environmental technologies specialty materials and life sciences corning manufactures and processes products at approximately 90 plants in 17 countries 

display technologies segment 

corning’s display technologies segment manufactures glass substrates for active matrix liquid crystal displays “lcds” that are used primarily in lcd televisions notebook computers and flat panel desktop monitors this segment develops manufactures and supplies high quality glass substrates using technology expertise and a proprietary fusion manufacturing process which corning invented and is the cornerstone of the company’s technology leadership in the lcd industry the automated process yields high quality glass substrates with excellent dimensional stability and uniformity – essential attributes for the production of large high performance active matrix lcds corning’s fusion process is scalable and is thought to be the most effective process in producing large size substrates we are recognized for providing product innovations that help our customers produce larger lighter thinner and higherresolution displays more affordably in 2006 corning launched eagle xg® the industry’s first lcd glass substrate that is free of heavy metals in 2010 leveraging the eagle xg® composition corning introduced eagle xg® slim glass a line of slim glass substrates which enables lighterweight portable devices and thinner televisions and monitors in 2011 corning launched corning lotus™ glass a highperformance display glass developed to enable cuttingedge technologies including organic lightemitting diode “oled” displays and next generation lcds corning lotus glass helps support the demanding manufacturing processes of both oled and liquid crystal displays for high performance portable devices such as smart phones tablets and notebook computers in 2012 corning introduced corning® willow™ glass our ultraslim flexible glass for use in nextgeneration consumer electronic technologies not only does this technology support thinner backplanes for both oled and lcd displays it also allows for curved displays for immersive viewing or mounting on nonflat surfaces in 2013 corning announced the commercial launch of corning lotus™ xt glass a secondgeneration glass substrate specially formulated for highperformance displays the corning lotus glass platform offers an energyefficient immersive display device that features high resolution fast response times and bright picture quality in january 2015 corning introduced corning iris™ glass a substrate that can significantly reduce the thickness of a liquid crystal display television set making it as thin as a smartphone as well as providing outstanding transmission quality 

through the end of 2013 the display technologies segment also included the equity affiliate samsung corning precision materials co ltd “samsung corning precision materials” of which corning owned 575 and samsung display co ltd “samsung display” owned 425 to extend corning’s leadership in specialty glass and drive earnings growth corning entered into a series of strategic and financial agreements with samsung display intended to strengthen product and technology collaborations between the two companies “acquisition” corning completed this transaction on january 15 2014 

  

the following is a summary of the series of transactions and the impacts to the display technologies segment 

 

 

 

 

in connection with these agreements in the fourth quarter of 2013 corning acquired the minority interests of three shareholders in samsung corning precision materials for 506 million which included payment for the transfer of nonoperating assets and the prorata portion of cash on samsung corning precision materials’ balance sheet at september 30 2013 the resulting transfer of shares to corning increased corning’s ownership percentage of samsung corning precision materials from 50 to 575 because this transaction did not result in a change in control based on the governing documents of this entity corning did not consolidate this entity as of december 31 2013 the remaining transactions were completed on january 15 2014 which increased corning’s ownership to 100 and resulted in consolidation of the entity beginning in the first quarter of 2014 

lcd glass manufacturing is a capital intensive business important attributes for success include efficient manufacturing access to capital technology knowhow and patents as a result of the transactions with samsung display corning expects to realize increased flexibility in glassmelting capabilities which will allow the company to reevaluate the need for major capital expenditures for additional fusion glass manufacturing assets 

corning has lcd glass manufacturing operations in the united states south korea japan taiwan and china following the acquisition corning services all specialty glass customers in all regions directly utilizing its manufacturing facilities throughout asia 

patent protection and proprietary trade secrets are important to the display technologies segment’s operations corning has a growing portfolio of patents relating to its products technologies and manufacturing processes corning licenses certain of its patents to third parties and generates royalty income from these licenses refer to the material under the heading “patents and trademarks” for information relating to patents and trademarks 

the display technologies segment represented 40 of corning’s sales in 2014 

optical communications segment 

corning invented the world’s first lowloss optical fiber in 1970 since that milestone we have continued to pioneer optical fiber cable and connectivity solutions as global bandwidth demand driven by video usage grows exponentially networks continue to migrate from copper to opticalbased systems that can deliver the required costeffective bandwidthcarrying capacity our unrivaled experience puts us in a unique position to design and deliver optical solutions that reach every edge of the communications network 

our optical communications segment has recently evolved from being a manufacturer of optical fiber and cable hardware and equipment to being a comprehensive provider of industryleading optical solutions across the broader communications industry this segment is classified into two main product groupings – carrier network and enterprise network the carrier network product group consists primarily of products and solutions for opticalbased communications infrastructure for services such as video data and voice communications the enterprise network product group consists primarily of opticalbased communication networks sold to businesses governments and individuals for their own use

 item 1a risk factors 

 

we operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock or debt the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

  

as a global company we face many risks which could adversely impact our ongoing operations and reported financial results 

we operate in over 100 countries and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from and have significant operations outside of the united states our international operations include manufacturing assembly sales customer support and shared administrative service centers 

compliance with laws and regulations increases our cost of doing business these laws and regulations include us laws and local laws which include data privacy requirements employment and labor laws tax laws anticompetition regulations prohibitions on payments to governmental officials import and trade restrictions and export requirements noncompliance or violations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks 

we are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization including those related to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions of one or more key customers or the circumstances to which they are subject leading to the substantial reduction in orders for our products 

in 2014 corning’s ten largest customers accounted for 48 of our sales 

in addition a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in our reportable segments for 2014 three customers of the display technologies segment accounted for 61 of total segment net sales when combined in the optical communications segment one customer accounted for 11 of segment net sales in the environmental technologies segment three customers accounted for 88 of total segment sales in aggregate in the specialty materials segment three customers accounted for 51 of segment sales in 2014 in the life sciences segment two customers accounted for 45 of segment sales in 2014 as a result of mergers and consolidations between customers corning’s customer base could become more concentrated 

our optical communications segment customers’ purchases of our products are affected by their capital expansion plans general market and economic uncertainty and regulatory changes including broadband policy sales in the optical communications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of fibertothepremises deployments our sales will be dependent on planned targets for homes passed and connected changes in our customers’ deployment plans could adversely affect future sales 

  

in the environmental technologies segment sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for automotive and diesel emissions tend to fluctuate with vehicle production changes in laws and regulations for air quality and emission controls may also influence future sales sales in our environmental technologies segment are mainly to three catalyzers and emission system control manufacturers our customers sell these systems to automobile and diesel engine original equipment manufacturers sales in this segment may be affected by adverse developments in the global vehicle or freight hauling industries or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicle sales or downturns in freight traffic 

certain sales in our specialty materials segment track worldwide economic cycles and our customers’ responses to those cycles in addition any positive trends in prior years in the sales of strengthened glass may not continue we may experience losses relating to our inability to supply contracted quantities of this glass and processes planned to produce new versions of this glass may not be successful 

sales in our life sciences segment are concentrated with two large distributors who are also competitors and the balance is to a variety of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies hospitals universities and other research facilities in 2014 our two largest distributors accounted for 45 of life sciences’ segment sales changes in our distribution arrangements in this segment may adversely affect this segment’s financial results 

our operations and financial performance could be negatively impacted if the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies evolving industry or regulatory standards and new product introductions our success is dependent on the successful introduction of new products or upgrades of current products and our ability to compete with new technologies the following factors related to our products and markets if they do not continue as in the recent past could have an adverse impact on our operations 

 

 

 

we face pricing pressures in each of our businesses that could adversely affect our financial performance 

we face pricing pressure in each of our businesses as a result of intense competition emerging technologies or overcapacity while we work consistently toward reducing our costs to offset pricing pressures we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or sustain our current rate of cost reduction we anticipate pricing pressures will continue in the future in all our businesses 

any of these items could cause our sales profitability and cash flows to be significantly reduced 

we face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations 

because we have significant customers and operations outside the us fluctuations in foreign currencies especially the japanese yen new taiwan dollar korean won and euro will significantly impact our sales profit and cash flows foreign exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the us dollar and japanese yen sales in our display technologies segment representing 40 of corning’s sales in 2014 are denominated in japanese yen corning hedges significant translation transaction and balance sheet currency exposures and uses a variety of derivative instruments to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities as well as operating results including our net profits 

  

a large portion of our sales profit and cash flows are transacted in nonus dollar currencies and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to these exposures net of gains or losses from our hedging programs for example we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures or should we elect not to hedge certain foreign currency exposures alternatively we may experience gains or losses if the underlying exposure which we have hedged change increases or decreases and we are unable to reverse unwind or terminate the hedges concurrent with the change in the underlying notional exposure the objective of our hedging activities is to mitigate the risk associated with foreign currency exposures we are also exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts however we minimize this risk by maintaining a diverse group of highlyrated major international financial institutions with which we have other financial relationships as our counterparties we do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors all of these factors could materially impact our results of operations anticipated future results financial position and cash flows the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control 

if the financial condition of our customers declines our credit risks could increase 

although we have a rigorous process to administer credit and believe our bad debt reserve is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable if our customers or our indirect customers fail to meet their payment obligations for our products we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amounts reserved many customers of our display technologies and specialty materials segments are thinly capitalized andor unprofitable in our optical communications segment certain large infrastructure projects are subject to governmental funding which if terminated could adversely impact the financial strength of our customers these factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business 

the success of our business depends on our ability to develop and produce advantaged products that meet our customers’ needs 

  

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our customers original equipment manufacturers and distributors this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to manage and maintain key customer relationships our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers the manufacturing of our products involves complex and precise processes in some cases existing manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the requirements of our customers we will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to maintain profitable operations while we continue to fund projects to improve our manufacturing techniques and processes and lower our costs we may not achieve satisfactory manufacturing costs that will fully enable us to meet our profitability targets 

in addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on our ability to innovate with respect to both products and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations failure to continue to deliver quality and competitive products to the marketplace to adequately protect our intellectual property rights to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our future financial performance depends on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials precious metals parts and manufacturing equipment to meet the demands of our customers 

our ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials precious metals parts and components from our suppliers we may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages there can be no assurances that we will not encounter problems in the future furthermore certain manufacturing equipment raw materials or components are available only from a single source or limited sources we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner a reduction interruption or delay of supply or a significant increase in the price for supplies such as manufacturing equipment precious metals raw materials or energy could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

  

if our products including materials purchased from our suppliers experience performance issues our business will suffer 

our business depends on the production of products of consistently high quality our products components and materials purchased from our suppliers are typically tested for quality these testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios for various reasons our products including materials purchased from our suppliers may fail to perform as a customer expected in some cases product redesigns or additional expense may be required to address such issues a significant or systemic quality issue could result in customer relations problems lost sales reduced volumes product recalls and financial damages and penalties 

we have incurred and may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 

at december 31 2014 corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of 1647 million while we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe or if acquisitions and investments made by the company fail to achieve expected returns 

we operate in a highly competitive environment 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on the company’s share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace the company competes on the basis of product attributes customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties product performance failures our failure to price our products competitively our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or unexpected emerging technologies or products we expect that we will face continuous competition from existing competitors low cost manufacturers and new entrants we believe we must invest in research and development engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities and continue to improve customer service in order to remain competitive we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position 

we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses particularly lcd glass and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices if our competitors offer significant discounts on certain products or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to retain our customers and market positions any such changes may reduce our profitability and cash flow any broadbased change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as we implement and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies if we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand our revenues could decrease 

lcd glass generates a significant amount of the company’s profits and cash flow and any events that adversely affect the market for lcd glass substrates could have a material and negative impact on our financial results 

corning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the level of profitability of our lcd glass business as a result any event that adversely affects our display business could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial results these events could include loss of patent protection increased costs associated with manufacturing and increased competition from the introduction of new and more desirable products if any of these events had a material adverse effect on the sales of our lcd glass such an event could result in material charges and a significant reduction in profitability 

additionally emerging material technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications including display glass cover glass and others resulting in a decline in demand for our products existing or new production capacity for glass substrates may exceed the demand for them technologies for displays cover glass and other applications in competition with our glass may reduce or eliminate the need for our glass substrates new process technologies developed by our competitors may also place us at a cost or quality disadvantage our own process technologies may be acquired or used unlawfully by others enabling them to compete with us our inability to manufacture glass substrates to the specifications required by our customers may result in loss of revenue margins and profits or liabilities for failure to supply a scarcity of resources limitations on technology personnel or other factors resulting in a failure to produce commercial quantities of glass substrates could have adverse financial consequences to us 

  

changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

a significant amount of our net profits and cash flows are generated from outside the us and certain repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that could significantly impact how us global corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form proposed legislation may pass if enacted certain antideferral proposals could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow 

our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees 

the loss of the services of any member of our senior management team or key research and development or engineering personnel without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance 

we are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations 

some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste waste water other industrial waste or greenhouse gases and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of such substances we have installed antipollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities we have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations however we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps toward adopting more stringent environmental standards 

any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us or the suspensioncessation of production or operations in addition environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the us and other countries such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and co 2 abatement may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by among other things substantially increasing manufacturing costs limiting availability of scarce resources especially energy or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers 

  

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on patent and trade secret laws copyright trademark confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses we cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property worldwide may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of or the unauthorized use of our intellectual property litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are often unpredictable if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive 

the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios we periodically receive notices from or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights andor breach of our agreements with them these third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design manufacture or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us 

current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations 

as described in legal proceedings in this form 10k we are engaged in litigation and regulatory matters litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain and adverse rulings could occur resulting in significant liabilities penalties or damages such current or future substantial legal liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

we may not capture significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all 

developing our products through research and development is expensive and the investment often involves a long return on investment cycle we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by increases in our gross margin we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position 

business disruptions could affect our operating results 

a significant portion of our manufacturing research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas a major earthquake fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

additionally a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our display technologies segment is concentrated in three overseas countries and it is reasonably possible that the operations of one or more such facilities could be disrupted due to the specialized nature of the assets and the customers’ locations it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from facilities in other countries accordingly loss of these facilities could produce a nearterm severe impact on our display business and the company as a whole 

we face risks through equity affiliates that we do not control 

corning’s net income includes equity earnings from affiliated companies for the year ended december 31 2014 we recognized 266 million of equity earnings of which approximately 95 came from dow corning which makes silicone and high purity polycrystalline products 

  

our equity investments may not continue to perform at the same levels as in recent years dow corning emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2004 and has certain obligations under its plan of reorganization to resolve and fund claims of its creditors and personal injury claimants dow corning may incur further bankruptcy charges in the future which may adversely affect its operations or assets dow corning also could be adversely impacted by diminished performance at their consolidated subsidiary hemlock semiconductor group in addition we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may adversely affect us 

we may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us 

we face the risk of loss resulting from product liability asbestos securities fiduciary liability intellectual property antitrust contractual warranty environmental fraud and other lawsuits whether or not such claims are valid in addition our product liability fiduciary directors and officers property policies including business interruption natural catastrophe and comprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect in the future a successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us to make substantial unplanned payments some of the carriers in our historical primary and excess insurance programs are in liquidation and may not be able to respond if we should have claims reaching their policies the financial health of other insurers may deteriorate several of our insurance carriers are litigating with us the extent if any of their obligation to provide insurance coverage for asbestos liabilities asserted against us the results of that litigation may adversely affect our insurance coverage for those risks in addition we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain types of risk such as political risks terrorism or war 

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our continued operation and expansion outside the united states including in developing countries could increase the risk of alleged violations violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

moreover several of our related partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws rules and business practices that differ from those in the united states although we strive to select equity partners and affiliates who share our values and understand our reporting requirements as a usdomiciled company and to ensure that an appropriate business culture exists within these ventures to minimize and mitigate our risk we nonetheless face the reputational and legal risk that our equity partners and affiliates may violate applicable laws rules and business practices 

acquisitions equity investments and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business 

we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into equity investments and strategic alliances as part of our business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that a transaction may not advance our business strategy that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment or that we experience difficulty integrating new employees business systems and technology or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits such as increased revenue and cash flow enhanced efficiencies or market share or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized these events could harm our operating results or financial condition 

  

improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation 

we store and process personallyidentifiable information of our employees and in some case our customers at the same time the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of the increasingly hostile information security environment this environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies despite these efforts it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

significant macroeconomic events changes in regulations or a crisis in the financial markets could limit our access to capital 

we utilize credit in both the capital markets and from banks to facilitate company borrowings hedging transactions leases and other financial transactions we maintain a 2 billion revolving credit agreement to fund potential liquidity needs and to backstop certain transactions an adverse macroeconomic event or changes in bank regulations could limit our ability to gain access to credit or to renew the revolving credit agreement upon expiration additionally a financial markets crisis may limit our ability to access liquidity 

adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our cash investments 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various types of securities with varying maturities and credit quality these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that have affected global financial markets we also make significant investments in us government securities either directly or through investment in money market funds if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline or if the us defaults on its debt obligations or its debt is downgraded our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely impact our financial results 

information technology dependency and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue liability claims or competitive harm 

the company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure any significant breakdown intrusion interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business like other global companies we have from time to time experienced incidents related to our information technology “it” systems and expect that such incidents will continue including malware and computer virus attacks unauthorized access systems failures and disruptions we have measures and defenses in place against unauthorized access but we may not be able to prevent immediately detect or remediate such events 

we use electronic it in our manufacturing processes and operations and other aspects of our business despite our implementation of security measures our it systems are vulnerable to disruptions from computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized access cyberattack and other similar disruptions a material breach in the security of our it systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets such disruptions or security breaches could result in the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business 

additionally utilities and other operators of critical energy infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks including cyberattack in the event of such an attack disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power electrical gas etc 

international trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position 

  

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us including our equity affiliatesjoint ventures from being able to sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations these policies also affect our equity companies

 item 3 legal proceedings 

dow corning corporation corning and the dow chemical company “dow” each own 50 of the common stock of dow corning corporation “dow corning” 

dow corning breast implant litigation 

in may 1995 dow corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousands of breast implant product lawsuits on june 1 2004 dow corning emerged from chapter 11 with a plan of reorganization the “plan” which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims the plan also includes releases for corning and dow as shareholders in exchange for contributions to the plan 

under the terms of the plan dow corning has established and is funding a settlement trust and a litigation facility to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate their claims inclusive of insurance dow corning has paid approximately 18 billion to the settlement trust as of december 31 2014 dow corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of 400 million see note 7 investments for additional detail 

other dow corning claims arising from bankruptcy proceedings 

as a separate matter arising from the bankruptcy proceedings dow corning is defending claims asserted by a number of commercial creditors who claim additional interest at default rates and enforcement costs during the period from may 1995 through june 2004 as of december 31 2014 dow corning has estimated the liability to commercial creditors to be within the range of 99 million to 324 million as dow corning management believes no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range dow corning has recorded the minimum liability within the range should dow corning not prevail in this matter corning’s equity earnings would be reduced by its 50 share of the amount in excess of 99 million net of applicable tax benefits there are a number of other claims in the bankruptcy proceedings against dow corning awaiting resolution by the us district court and it is reasonably possible that dow corning may record bankruptcyrelated charges in the future the remaining tort claims against dow corning are expected to be channeled by the plan into facilities established by the plan or otherwise defended by the litigation facility 

  

pittsburgh corning corporation and asbestos litigation corning and ppg industries inc “ppg” each own 50 of the capital stock of pittsburgh corning corporation “pcc” over a period of more than two decades pcc and several other defendants have been named in numerous lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos on april 16 2000 pcc filed for chapter 11 reorganization in the us bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania at the time pcc filed for bankruptcy protection there were approximately 11800 claims pending against corning in state court lawsuits alleging various theories of liability based on exposure to pcc’s asbestos products and typically requesting monetary damages in excess of one million dollars per claim corning has defended those claims on the basis of the separate corporate status of pcc and the absence of any facts supporting claims of direct liability arising from pcc’s asbestos products 

pcc plan of reorganization 

corning with other relevant parties has been involved in ongoing efforts to develop a plan of reorganization that would resolve the concerns and objections of the relevant courts and parties on november 12 2013 the bankruptcy court issued a decision finally confirming an amended pcc plan of reorganization the “amended pcc plan” or the “plan” on september 30 2014 the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania the “district court” affirmed the bankruptcy court’s decision confirming the amended pcc plan on october 30 2014 one of the objectors to the plan appealed the district court’s affirmation of the plan to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit the “third circuit court of appeals” and that appeal is currently being scheduled for briefing it will likely take many months for the third circuit court of appeals to render its decision 

under the plan as affirmed by the bankruptcy court and affirmed by the district court corning is required to contribute its equity interests in pcc and pittsburgh corning europe nv “pce” a belgian corporation and to contribute 290 million in a fixed series of payments recorded at present value corning has the option to use its shares rather than cash to make these payments but the liability is fixed by dollar value and not the number of shares the plan requires corning to make 1 one payment of 70 million one year from the date the plan becomes effective and certain conditions are met and 2 five additional payments of 35 million 50 million 35 million 50 million and 50 million respectively on each of the five subsequent anniversaries of the first payment the final payment of which is subject to reduction based on the application of credits under certain circumstances 

nonpcc asbestos litigation 

in addition to the claims against corning related to its ownership interest in pcc corning is also the defendant in approximately 9700 other cases approximately 37300 claims alleging injuries from asbestos related to its corhart business and similar amounts of monetary damages per case when pcc filed for bankruptcy protection the court granted a preliminary injunction to suspend all asbestos cases against pcc ppg and corning – including these nonpcc asbestos cases the “stay” the stay remains in place as of the date of this filing under the bankruptcy court’s order confirming the amended pcc plan the stay will remain in place until the amended pcc plan is finally affirmed by the district court and the third circuit court of appeals these nonpcc asbestos cases have been covered by insurance without material impact to corning to date as of december 31 2014 corning had received for these cases approximately 19 million in insurance payments related to those claims if and when the bankruptcy court’s confirmation of the amended pcc plan is finally affirmed these nonpcc asbestos claims would be allowed to proceed against corning corning has recorded in its estimated asbestos litigation liability an additional 150 million for these and any future nonpcc asbestos cases 

  

total estimated liability for the amended pcc plan and the nonpcc asbestos claims 

the liability for the amended pcc plan and the nonpcc asbestos claims was estimated to be 681 million at december 31 2014 compared with an estimate of liability of 690 million at december 31 2013 the 681 million liability is comprised of 241 million of the fair value of pce 290 million for the fixed series of payments and 150 million for the nonpcc asbestos litigation all referenced in the preceding paragraphs with respect to the pce liability at december 31 2014 and 2013 the fair value of 241 million and 250 million of our interest in pce significantly exceeded its carrying value of 162 million and 167 million respectively there have been no impairment indicators for our investment in pce and we continue to recognize equity earnings of this affiliate at the time corning recorded this liability it determined it lacked the ability to recover the carrying amount of its investment in pcc and its investment was other than temporarily impaired as a result we reduced our investment in pcc to zero as the fair value in pce is significantly higher than book value management believes that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than the fair value of the liability is remote with respect to the liability for other asbestos litigation the liability for nonpcc claims was estimated based upon industry data for asbestos claims since corning does not have recent claim history due to the injunction issued by the bankruptcy court the estimated liability represents the undiscounted projection of claims and related legal fees over the next 20 years the amount may need to be adjusted in future periods as more data becomes available however we cannot estimate any additional losses at this time for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 corning recorded asbestos litigation income of 9 million and expense of 19 million respectively the entire obligation is classified as a noncurrent liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than 12 months after the amended pcc plan becomes effective and the pce portion of the obligation will be fulfilled through the direct contribution of corning’s investment in pce currently recorded as a noncurrent other equity method investment 

nonpcc asbestos cases insurance litigation 

several of corning’s insurers have commenced litigation in state courts for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies including rights that may be affected by the potential resolutions described above corning is vigorously contesting these cases and management is unable to predict the outcome of the litigation 

environmental litigation corning has been named by the united states environmental protection agency the “epa” under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by the epa are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the epa agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2014 and 2013 corning had accrued approximately 425 million undiscounted and 15 million undiscounted respectively for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote

overview 

the impact of the acquisition of the remaining equity interests in our affiliate samsung corning precision materials now known as corning precision materials combined with strong business performance in the environmental technologies and optical communications segments drove an increase in sales of 24 in the year ended december 31 2014 when compared to the same period last year net income increased significantly in 2014 up 26 driven by the net gain on our yendenominated hedging program the consolidation of corning precision materials the positive impact of the change in the contingent consideration fair value resulting from the acquisition an increase in equity earnings from dow corning and higher net income in the environmental technologies and optical communications segments the increase was offset somewhat by price declines outpacing volume increases in the display technologies segment the negative impact of the depreciation of the japanese yen against the us dollar several taxrelated items and the net loss on several acquisitionrelated items 

net sales in the year ended december 31 2014 were 9715 million compared to 7819 million in the year ended december 31 2013 when compared to 2013 the change in net sales was driven by the following items 

 

 

 

for the year ended december 31 2014 we generated net income of 25 billion or 173 per share compared to net income of 2 billion or 134 per share for 2013 when compared to last year the increase in net income was due to the following items amounts presented after tax

corning remains committed to a strategy of growing through global innovation this strategy has served us well our key priorities for 2014 were similar to those in prior years protect our financial health and invest in the future during 2014 we made the following progress on these priorities 

protecting financial health 

our financial position remained sound and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities significant items in 2014 included the following 

 

 

 

investing in our future 

corning is one of the world’s leading innovators in materials science for more than 160 years corning has applied its unparalleled expertise in specialty glass ceramics and optical physics to develop products that have created new industries and transformed people’s lives although our spending level for research development and engineering decreased slightly from 9 of sales in 2013 to 8 of sales in 2014 we maintained our innovation strategy focused on growing our existing businesses developing opportunities adjacent or closely related to our existing technical and manufacturing capabilities and investing in longrange opportunities in each of our market segments we continue to work on new products including glass substrates for high performance displays and lcd applications precision glass for advanced displays emissions control products for cars trucks and offroad vehicles products that accelerate drug discovery and manufacturing and the optical fiber cable and hardware and equipment that enable fibertothepremises and next generation data centers in addition we are focusing on wireless solutions for diverse venue applications such as distributed antenna systems fibertothe cell site and fibertothe antenna we have focused our research development and engineering spending to support the advancement of new product attributes for our corning® gorilla® glass suite of products we will continue to focus on adjacent glass opportunities which leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes including corning® willow™ glass our ultraslim flexible glass substrate for use in nextgeneration consumer electronic technologies 

capital spending totaled 11 billion in 2014 slightly above the amount spent in 2013 spending in 2014 was driven primarily by the display technologies segment and focused on finishing line optimization and tank rebuilds we expect our 2015 capital expenditures to be approximately 13 billion to 14 billion we anticipate approximately 650 million will be allocated to our display technologies segment  

  

corporate outlook 

we expect 2015 to produce another year of sales increases in our optical communications life sciences specialty materials and environmental technologies segments and for the lcd retail glass market and corning’s glass volume to grow we believe the overall lcd glass retail market in 2015 will increase in the highsingle digits driven by the combination of an increase in retail sales of lcd televisions and the demand for larger television screen sizes we anticipate a rise in global demand for corning’s carrier network products combined with growth of enterprise network products will increase sales in our optical communications segment we believe sales of corning gorilla glass will improve in 2015 as we expect price declines to be moderate and volume to improve in line with the increase in the handheld market and we expect another strong year of manufacturing process improvements and cost reductions which in combination with sales growth will deliver overall earnings growth for corning we remain confident that our strategy to grow through global innovation while preserving our financial stability will enable our continued longterm success

net sales 

corning’s net sales in the year ended december 31 2014 improved in all of our segments increasing by 1896 million to 9715 million when compared to the same period in 2013 driven by the following events 

 

 

 

 

 

for the year ended december 31 2013 net sales remained relatively consistent when compared to the year ended december 31 2012 with higher sales in the optical communications and life sciences segments offset by declines in the display technologies environmental technologies and specialty materials segments the change in net sales was largely driven by the following 

 

 

 

 

 

in 2014 2013 and 2012 sales into international markets accounted for 77 74 and 77 respectively of total net sales 

cost of sales 

the types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are raw materials consumption including direct and indirect materials salaries wages and benefits depreciation and amortization production utilities productionrelated purchasing warehousing including receiving and inspection repairs and maintenance interlocation inventory transfer costs production and warehousing facility property insurance rent for production facilities and other production overhead 

  

gross margin 

for 2014 gross margin dollars increased by 728 million when compared to 2013 driven largely by the consolidation of corning precision materials combined with an increase of 102 million in the environmental technologies segment from higher volume and improved manufacturing efficiencies gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased when compared to the same period last year due primarily to the impact of the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the us dollar in the amount of 333 million price declines in the midteens in percentage terms in our display technologies segment higher pension expense of approximately 50 million and the impact of inventory builds in 2013 in the optical communications and specialty materials segments that did not repeat in 2014 

for 2013 gross margin dollars and as a percentage of sales increased when compared to 2012 led by a decrease in pension expense in the amount of 150 million driven by a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used to value our us pension liability and an increase of 6 in the specialty materials segment resulting from improvements in manufacturing efficiency and cost reduction programs the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the us dollar and price declines in the display technologies segment partially offset the increase 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2014 increased by 85 million when compared to 2013 the increase was largely driven by the consolidation of corning precision materials which added 90 million an increase in pension expense of approximately 27 million an increase of 38 million in sharebased and performancebased compensation expenses and an increase of approximately 90 million in acquisitionrelated costs including 72 million of postcombination compensation expense offset somewhat by the positive impact of a contingent consideration fair value adjustment of 249 million as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses were 12 considerably lower than the same period in 2013 largely due to the contingent consideration fair value adjustment more than offsetting the increase in selling general and administrative expenses resulting from the acquisition 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2013 decreased by 79 million when compared to 2012 this decrease was largely driven by a decrease in pension expense in the amount of 76 million driven by a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used to value our us pension liability cost control measures implemented in our segments and a decline in variable compensation in the amount of 27 million offset somewhat by an increase in costs in the optical communications specialty materials and life sciences segments as a percentage of net sales these expenses decreased when compared to the same period last year 

the types of expenses included in the selling general and administrative expenses line item are salaries wages and benefits travel professional fees and depreciation and amortization utilities and rent for administrative facilities 

research development and engineering expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2014 research development and engineering expenses increased by 105 million when compared to the same period last year driven by the consolidation of corning precision materials which added 69 million an increase of approximately 30 million in new business development spending and 20 million of additional pension expense we continue to focus on new product development in areas such as glass substrates for high performance displays in our display technologies segment wireless solutions for diverse venue applications in the optical communications segment and advancement of new product attributes for our corning gorilla glass suite of products in our specialty materials segment as a percentage of net sales research development and engineering expenses declined slightly from 9 in 2013 to 8 in 2014 reflecting cost control measures implemented in 2014 

for the year ended december 31 2013 research development and engineering expenses decreased by 59 million when compared to the same period last year driven by a decrease in pension expense in the amount of 47 million driven by a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used to value our us pension liability and declines in our display technologies and environmental technologies segments of 19 million and 11 million respectively offset slightly by higher costs in the optical communications specialty materials and life sciences segments as a percentage of net sales research development and engineering expenses declined slightly in the year ended december 31 2013 when compared to the same period in 2012 

  

restructuring impairment and other charges and credits 

corning recorded restructuring impairment and other charges and credits in 2014 2013 and 2012 which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented additional information on restructuring and asset impairment is found in note 2 restructuring impairment and other charges to the consolidated financial statements a description of those charges and credits follows 

2014 activity 

for the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded charges of 71 million for workforce reductions asset disposals and writeoffs and exit costs for restructuring activities with total cash expenditures estimated to be 51 million annualized savings from these actions are estimated to be approximately 94 million and will be reflected largely in selling general and administrative expenses 

2013 activity 

to better align our 2014 cost position in several of our businesses corning implemented a global restructuring plan within several of our segments in the fourth quarter of 2013 consisting of workforce reductions asset disposals and writeoffs and exit costs we recorded charges of 67 million before tax associated with these actions with total cash expenditures expected to be approximately 40 million 

2012 activity 

in response to uncertain global economic conditions and the potential for slower growth in many of our businesses in 2013 corning implemented a corporatewide restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded charges of 89 million before tax which included costs for workforce reductions asset writeoffs and exit costs total cash expenditures associated with these actions were approximately 49 million and spending for employeerelated costs was completed in 2013 

the specialty materials segment recorded an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2011 in the amount of 130 million before tax related to certain assets used in the production of large cover glass due to sales that were significantly below our expectations in the fourth quarter of 2012 after reassessing the large cover glass business corning concluded that the large cover glass market was developing differently in 2012 than our expectations demand for largersized cover glass was declining and the market for this type of glass was instead targeting smaller gen size products additionally in the fourth quarter of 2012 our primary customer of large cover glass notified corning of its decision to exit from this display market based on these events we recorded an additional impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the amount of 44 million before tax this impairment charge represents a writedown of assets specific to the glassstrengthening process for large size cover glass to their fair market values and includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process 

asbestos litigation 

in 2014 we recorded a decrease to our asbestos litigation liability of 9 million compared to an increase of 19 million in 2013 and 14 million in 2012 

our asbestos litigation liability was estimated to be 681 million at december 31 2014 compared with an estimate of 690 million at december 31 2013 the entire obligation is classified as a noncurrent liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than 12 months after the proposed amended pcc plan is ultimately effective and a portion of the obligation will be fulfilled through the direct contribution of corning’s investment in pce currently recorded as a noncurrent other equity method investment

equity in earnings of affiliated companies 

the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies in millions 

 

equity earnings of affiliated companies decreased in the twelve months ended december 31 2014 when compared to the same period last year reflecting the acquisition and consolidation of samsung corning precision materials offset somewhat by an increase in equity earnings from dow corning 

dow corning 

the following table provides a summary of equity earnings from dow corning by component in millions 

 

beginning in the latter half of 2011 and continuing into 2012 dow corning began experiencing unfavorable industry conditions at its consolidated subsidiary hemlock a producer of high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries driven by overcapacity at all levels of the solar industry supply chain this overcapacity led to significant declines in polycrystalline spot prices in the fourth quarter of 2011 and prices remained depressed throughout 2012 in 2013 markets stabilized but prices remain significantly below historical levels 

due to the conditions and uncertainties during 2012 described above sales volume declined and production levels of certain operating assets were reduced as a result in the fourth quarter of 2012 dow corning determined that a polycrystalline silicon plant expansion previously delayed since the fourth quarter of 2011 would no longer be economically viable and made the decision to abandon this expansion activity the abandonment resulted in an impairment charge of 57 million before tax for corning’s share of the write down in the value of these constructioninprogress assets further the startup of another polycrystalline silicon plant expansion that was expected to begin production in 2013 was delayed and its assets were idled 

in july 2012 the mofcom initiated antidumping and countervailing duty investigations of imports of solargrade polycrystalline silicon products from the us and south korea based on a petition filed by chinese solargrade polycrystalline silicon producers the petition alleged that producers within these countries exported solargrade polycrystalline silicon to china at less than fair value and that production of solargrade polycrystalline silicon in the us has been subsidized by the us government on july 18 2013 mofcom announced its preliminary determination that china’s solargrade polycrystalline silicon industry suffered material damage because of dumping by producers in the us and korea the chinese authorities imposed provisional antidumping duties on producers in the us and korea ranging from 24 to 570 including duties of 533 on future imports of solargrade polycrystalline silicon product from the dow corning subsidiary into china on september 16 2013 the chinese authorities imposed provisional countervailing duties of 65 on solar grade polycrystalline silicon products from the dow corning subsidiary on january 20 2014 mofcom issued a final determination the final determination resulted in no change to the antidumping duties and the countervailing duties were reduced to 21 the requirement for customers to pay provisional duties on imports from solargrade polycrystalline silicon producers became effective on july 24 2013 for the antidumping duties and on september 20 2013 for the countervailing duties adjusted for the final determination dow corning will not be subject to duties for previous sales 

  

in december 2014 dow corning determined its polycrystalline silicon plant expansion which was delayed in the fourth quarter of 2012 would not be economically viable and made the decision to permanently abandon the assets this decision was made after review of sustained adverse market conditions and continued oversupply the cost of operating the facility and the ongoing impact of tariffs on polycrystalline silicon imported into china the decision to permanently cease use of these assets resulted in dow corning taking a pretax charge of approximately 15 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 corning’s share aftertax 465 million as a result of the significant change in the use of this asset dow corning assessed whether the carrying value of all polycrystalline silicon assets might be impaired dow corning’s estimates of future undiscounted cash flows indicated the polycrystalline silicon asset group was recoverable 

in may 1995 dow corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from breast implant product lawsuits on june 1 2004 dow corning emerged from chapter 11 with a plan of reorganization the “plan” which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims under the plan dow corning established and agreed to fund a products liability settlement program the “settlement facility” the plan contains a cap on the amount of payments required from dow corning to fund the settlement facility inclusive of insurance dow corning has paid approximately 18 billion to the settlement facility and approximately 13 billion has been paid to claimants out of the settlement facility dow corning’s recorded liability related to implant matters “implant liability” was approximately 17 billion at september 30 2014 representing dow corning’s estimated remaining obligation for future funding of the settlement facility 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 dow corning with the assistance of a thirdparty advisor developed an estimate of the future implant liability based on evidence that the actual funding required for the settlement facility is expected to be lower than the full funding cap set forth in the plan on december 12 2014 dow corning reduced its implant liability by approximately 13 billion corning’s share aftertax 393 million previously the implant liability was based on the full funding cap set forth in the plan the revised implant liability reflects dow corning’s best estimate of its remaining obligations under the plan should events or circumstances occur in the future which change dow corning’s estimate of the remaining funding obligations the implant liability will be revised this adjustment does not affect dow corning’s commitment or ability to fulfill its obligations under the settlement and all claims that qualify under the settlement will be paid according to the terms of the plan 

2014 vs 2013 

equity earnings from dow corning increased by 56 million in the twelve months ended december 31 2014 when compared to the same period in 2013 driven by the following items 

 

 

2013 vs 2012 

equity earnings from dow corning increased by 118 in the twelve months ended december 31 2013 when compared to the same period in 2012 due to the following items 

 

 

  

other income net 

“other income net” in corning’s consolidated statements of income includes the following in millions 

 

beginning in the first quarter of 2014 due to the acquisition and consolidation of samsung corning precision materials now corning precision materials royalty income from corning precision materials is no longer recognized in corning’s consolidated statement of income 

included in the line item foreign currency transaction and hedge gains net for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 is the impact of purchased collars and average forward contracts which hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the japanese yen against the us dollar and its impact on our net earnings in the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 we recorded net pretax gains on our yendenominated hedging programs in the amount of 1406 million and 435 million respectively which included 344 million and 110 million of realized gains respectively these gains were driven by the marktomarket valuation of the purchased collars and average forward contracts and occurred due to the depreciation in the 2014 and 2013 exchange rates for the japanese yen versus the us dollar of 14 and 22 respectively the gross notional value outstanding for purchased collars and average rate forward contracts was 98 billion at december 31 2014 and 68 billion at december 31 2013 refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks for additional details 

in the second quarter of 2014 following the acquisition we entered into a portfolio of zero cost collars to hedge our exposure to movements in the korean won and its impact on our net earnings these zero cost collars have a gross notional value outstanding at december 31 2014 of 23 billion and began settling quarterly in the third quarter of 2014 and will conclude at the end of 2015 the net pretax loss on these zero cost collars which is also included in the line item foreign currency transaction and hedge gains net was 37 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 and included 6 million of realized losses 

income before income taxes 

income before income taxes for the year ended december 31 2014 was negatively impacted by the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the us dollar in the amount of 297 million 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows dollars in millions 

 

the effective income tax rate for 2014 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

 

 

partially offsetting the benefits above is a 177 million charge attributable to a change in judgment on the realizability of certain foreign deferred taxes assets in germany and japan 

  

the effective income tax rate for 2013 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

 

 

 

 

partially offsetting the benefits above is a 48 million charge attributable to a change in the judgment regarding the realizability of certain foreign and state deferred tax assets 

corning has valuation allowances on certain shorterlived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss and state tax net operating loss carry forwards as well as other foreign net operating loss carryforwards because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character or amount required to utilize these assets before they expire the amount of us and foreign deferred tax assets that have remaining valuation allowances at december 31 2014 and 2013 was 298 million and 286 million respectively 

corning continues to indefinitely reinvest substantially all of its foreign earnings with the exception of approximately 10 million of current earnings that have very low or no tax cost associated with their repatriation our current analysis indicates that we have sufficient us liquidity including borrowing capacity to fund foreseeable us cash needs without requiring the repatriation of foreign cash one time or unusual items that may impact our ability or intent to keep our foreign earnings and cash indefinitely reinvested include significant us acquisitions stock repurchases shareholder dividends changes in tax laws derivative contract settlements or the development of tax planning ideas that allow us to repatriate earnings at minimal or no tax cost andor a change in our circumstances or economic conditions that negatively impact our ability to borrow or otherwise fund us needs from existing us sources as of december 31 2014 taxes have not been provided on approximately 103 billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings that are expected to remain invested indefinitely while it remains impracticable to calculate the tax cost of repatriating our total unremitted foreign earnings such cost could be material to the results of operations of corning in a particular period 

our foreign subsidiary in taiwan operates under various tax holiday arrangements the nature and extent of such arrangements vary and the benefits of such arrangements phase out through 2018 the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 04 12 and 17 percentage points for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

while we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next 12 months we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position 

refer to note 6 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding income tax matters 

net income attributable to corning incorporated 

as a result of the items discussed above net income and per share data was as follows in millions except per share amounts 

 

  

comprehensive income 

 

2014 vs 2013 

for the year ended december 31 2014 comprehensive income decreased by 528 million when compared to the same period in 2013 driven by an increase in unamortized losses for postretirement benefit plans and the negative impact of the change in foreign currency translation adjustments offset by an increase of 511 million in net income attributable to corning incorporated 

the increase in unamortized losses for postretirement benefit plans in the amount of 673 million is driven mainly by changes to the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to value corning’s us pension and postretirement medical and life benefit plan “opeb” obligations and the benefit plan obligations of our equity affiliate dow corning at december 31 2014 corning and dow corning adopted the society of actuaries mortality table rp2014 published in october 2014 along with an updated improvement scale and the discount rate for our us benefit plans decreased between 75 and 100 basis points at december 31 2014 the decrease in discount rates and the change in the mortality assumption for our us plans led to an actuarial aftertax loss of approximately 281 million versus a gain in 2013 of 392 million the loss of 281 million occurring in 2014 included the impact to our us pension and opeb plans from the mortality table change in the amount of 88 million the impact of 89 million from changes in other actuarial assumptions and 124 million from our equity affiliate dow corning offset by reclassifications to the income statement of 20 million aftertax related to us nonqualified and international pension plans because the actuarial loss for our us qualified pension plan did not fall outside of the corridor which is defined as equal to 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets at the beginning of the year it was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” and did not impact net income for the year ended december 31 2014 

the increase in the loss on foreign currency translation adjustments for the year ended december 31 2014 in the amount of 391 million was driven by the following items 1 the increase in the loss in the translation of corning’s consolidated subsidiaries in the amount of 65 million which resulted primarily from the depreciation of the japanese yen to us dollar translation rate during 2014 2 the increase in the loss in the translation of corning’s equity method investments in the amount of 190 million and 3 the reclassification of a gain to net income in the amount of 136 million related to the acquisition of samsung corning precision materials 

2013 vs 2012 

for the year ended december 31 2013 comprehensive income increased by 133 million when compared to the same period in 2012 driven by an increase in net income attributable to corning incorporated and an increase in unamortized gains for postretirement benefit plans offset partially by the increase in the loss on foreign currency translation adjustments 

the increase in the amount of unamortized gains for postretirement benefit plans is due to an increase of between 75 and 100 basis points in the discount rates used to value corning’s us pension and postretirement medical and life benefit plan “opeb” obligations and the benefit plan obligations of our equity affiliate dow corning at december 31 2013 the increase in discount rates led to an actuarial aftertax gain of 392 million because this gain did not fall outside of the corridor which is defined as equal to 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets at the beginning of the year the gain was recorded in aoci and did not impact net income for the year ended december 31 2013 

  

the increase in the loss on foreign currency translation adjustments for the year ended december 31 2013 in the amount of 503 million was driven by the following items 1 the increase in the loss in the translation of corning’s consolidated subsidiaries in the amount of 317 million which resulted primarily from the depreciation of the japanese yen to us dollar translation rate during 2013 2 the increase in the loss in the translation of corning’s equity method investments in the amount of 238 million which is attributed to the change in the korean won to us dollar translation rate during 2013 which impacted our equity affiliate samsung corning precision materials and 3 the absence of the 2012 reclassification of a gain to net income in the amount of 52 million related to the gain on the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary

reconciliation of nongaap measures 

we utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with gaap to assess our financial and operating performance a nongaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that i excludes amounts or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income or statement of cash flows or ii includes amounts or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income or statement of cash flows 

core net sales core equity earnings of affiliated companies and core earnings are nongaap financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the company’s operations

as reported 

2014 vs 2013 

when compared to the same period last year the increase of 1306 million in net sales in the year ended december 31 2014 was due to the acquisition of the remaining equity interests of our affiliate samsung corning precision materials and the consolidation of this entity which added 18 billion in net sales this impact was somewhat offset by price declines in the midteens in percentage terms which more than offset an increase in volume that was slightly more than 10 in percentage terms and the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the us dollar which adversely impacted net sales by 373 million 

net income in the display technologies segment increased by 102 million or 8 in the year ended december 31 2014 when compared to the same period last year this increase was driven by the following items 

 

 

 

the increase in net income was partially offset by the following items 

 

 

 

 

  

2013 vs 2012 

in 2013 net sales in the display technologies segment declined in the amount of 364 million when compared to 2012 primarily due to the impact of the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the us dollar in the amount of 537 million and price declines in the midteens in percentage terms offset somewhat by an increase in volume in the midtwenties the increase in volume was driven by higher sales of largersized lcd televisions defined as greater than 40 inches which increased by nearly 100 in 2013 and higher sales in mobile computing products including tablets and smart phones additionally during the fourth quarter of 2013 we renewed the agreements with key customers that we had announced in the fourth quarter of 2012 which stabilize corning’s share at each of the customers and maintain a fixed relationship between corning’s pricing and competitive pricing at that customer 

when compared to 2012 the 335 million decrease in equity earnings from samsung corning precision materials in 2013 reflected the impact of the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the us dollar in the amount of 201 million and price declines in the midteens in percentage terms volume remained relatively consistent in 2013 when compared to the levels in 2012 manufacturing improvements in the amount of 28 million were more than offset by higher taxes in the amount of 54 million driven by the partial expiration of a korean tax holiday and 28 million of asset writeoffs and disposals 

when compared to 2012 the decrease in net income of 322 million in the display technologies segment in 2013 reflects the impact of the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the us dollar in the amount of 479 million and the impact of price declines in the midteens in percentage terms these declines were partially offset by an increase in volume in the midtwenties in percentage terms the impact of gains realized on our purchased collars and average rate forwards in the amount of 90 million and cost reduction programs 

core performance 

2014 vs 2013 

when compared to the same period last year the increase in core net sales of 1680 million or 63 in the year ended december 31 2014 was due to the acquisition of the remaining equity interests of our affiliate corning precision materials and the consolidation of this entity which added 19 billion in net sales this impact was somewhat offset by price declines in the midteens in percentage terms which more than offset an increase in volume that was slightly more than 10 in percentage terms 

core earnings in the display technologies segment increased by 137 million or 11 in the year ended december 31 2014 when compared to the same period last year the increase was driven by the positive impact of the acquisition of corning precision materials and the resulting cost reductions gained through synergies coupled with improvements in manufacturing efficiency of 46 million partially offset by the impact of price declines in the midteens in percentage terms that more than offset the increase in volume 

2013 vs 2012 

in 2013 our display technologies segment regained positive momentum as demonstrated by the increase in core net sales of 7 when compared to core net sales in 2012 which declined by 7 when compared to 2011 during 2013 volume improvements in the midtwenties in percentage terms more than outpaced price declines in the midteens the increase in volume was driven by higher sales of largersized lcd televisions defined as greater than 40 inches which increased by nearly 100 in 2013 and higher sales in mobile computing products including tablets and smart phones additionally during the fourth quarter of 2013 we renewed the agreements with key customers that we had announced in the fourth quarter of 2012 which stabilize corning’s share at each of the customers and maintain a fixed relationship between corning’s pricing and competitive pricing at that customer 

when compared to 2012 the decrease in core equity earnings from samsung corning precision materials in 2013 reflected relatively consistent volume and price declines in the midteens in percentage terms manufacturing improvements in the amount of 28 million were more than offset by higher taxes in the amount of 54 million driven by the partial expiration of a korean tax holiday 

when compared to 2012 the increase in core earnings in the display technologies segment in 2013 reflects an increase in volume in the midtwenties in percentage terms and the impact of cost reduction programs partially offset by price declines in the midteens in percentage terms and the impact of lower equity earnings 

  

other information 

the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan south korea china and taiwan in 2014 three customers of the display technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for a combined 61 of total segment sales in 2013 four customers of the display technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for a combined 94 of total segment sales in 2012 three customers of the display technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for a combined 63 of total segment sales our customers face the same global economic dynamics as we do in this market our nearterm sales and profitability would be impacted if any of these significant customers were unable to continue to purchase our products 

in addition prior to consolidation samsung corning precision materials’ sales were concentrated across a small number of its customers in 2013 and 2012 sales to two lcd panel makers located in south korea accounted for approximately 93 of samsung corning precision materials sales in each of those two years 

corning has invested to expand capacity to meet the projected demand for lcd glass substrates in 2014 2013 and 2012 capital spending in this segment was approximately 400 million 350 million and 850 million respectively we expect capital spending for 2015 to be approximately 650 million 

outlook 

corning anticipates another year of growth in the lcd glass market in 2015 with retail demand up highsingle digits in percentage terms as measured in square feet we believe that supply chain inventory levels remain healthy and industry glass supply appears aligned with overall demand 

 

in the first quarter of 2015 corning anticipates lcd glass volume in its display technologies segment will be consistent to down slightly on a sequential basis following a very strong fourth quarter performance this is in line with normal seasonality in the business quarterly glass price declines are expected to be moderate again 

the end market demand for lcd televisions monitors and notebooks is dependent on consumer retail spending among other factors we are cautious about the potential negative impact that economic conditions particularly a global economic recession excess market capacity and world political tensions could have on consumer demand while the lcd industry has grown economic volatility along with consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes prices or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth therefore it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time but we believe that we have sufficient manufacturing flexibility to adjust to fluctuations in demand we may incur further charges in this segment to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity in addition changes in foreign exchange rates principally the japanese yen will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment in order to mitigate this risk corning entered into a series of foreign exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to movements in the japanese yen and its impact on our earnings

as reported 

2014 vs 2013 

in the twelve months ended december 31 2014 net sales of the optical communications segment increased by 326 million or 14 when compared to the same period in 2013 driven by a 254 million increase in sales of our carrier network products specifically the following items impacted sales within the carrier network products group in the year ended december 31 2014 

 

 

 

sales of enterprise network products also increased in the twelve months ended december 31 2014 up 72 million when compared to the same period in 2013 due to strong sales in all regions of the world led by an increase in sales of data center and lan products in europe and north america up 21 million and 20 million respectively and an increase of 16 million in wireless products sales 

  

net income increased by 6 million or 3 in 2014 when compared to 2013 the significant increase in volume for carrier network products in north america and europe and an increase in worldwide enterprise network product volume were somewhat offset by price declines in fiber and cable products 17 million of additional operating expenses driven by two small acquisitions and the absence of the inventory build we experienced in the first half of 2013 an increase in restructuring charges of 9 million an increase of 22 million in the amount of the pension marktomarket adjustment and the absence of the 11 million gain on change in control of an equity company that occurred in the second quarter of 2013 also negatively impacted the results of this segment 

2013 vs 2012 

in 2013 net sales of the optical communications segment increased when compared to 2012 driven by an increase of 163 million in the carrier network market driving the growth in carrier network products are the following items 

 

 

 

 

 

sales in the enterprise network market increased by 33 million in the year ended 2013 when compared to 2012 driven by higher sales of data center products in north america 

the increase in net income in 2013 when compared to 2012 reflects an increase in volume in carrier and enterprise network products improved manufacturing performance and the implementation of strong spending controls and cost reduction initiatives combined with an increase of 20 million on the gain in 2013 versus a loss in 2012 on the marktomarket of our defined benefit pension plans a reduction of 23 million in restructuring charges and a gain of 11 million on the change in control of an equity company this increase was somewhat offset by an increase in acquisitionrelated costs of 8 million and lower volume in optical fiber lower price and a less favorable mix of products sales in 2013 

movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the results of this segment in the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 

core performance 

2014 vs 2013 

when compared to the same period last year core earnings in the twelve months ended december 31 2014 increased by 35 million or 18 when compared to 2013 the significant increase in volume for carrier network products in north america and europe and an increase in worldwide enterprise network product volume were somewhat offset by price declines in fiber and cable products 17 million of additional operating expenses driven by two small acquisitions and the absence of the inventory build we experienced in the first half of 2013 

2013 vs 2012 

the increase in core earnings in 2013 when compared to 2012 reflects an increase in volume in carrier and enterprise network products improved manufacturing performance and the implementation of strong spending controls and cost reduction initiatives offset by lower volume in optical fiber lower price and a less favorable mix of products sales in 2013 movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the results of this segment 

the optical communications segment has a concentrated customer base in the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 one customer which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for 11 10 and 12 respectively of total segment net sales 

outlook 

optical communications segment sales in the first quarter of 2015 are expected to increase by more than 10 percent when compared to the first quarter of 2014 as the segment continues its strong overall performance

as reported 

2014 vs 2013 

in the twelve months ended december 31 2014 net sales of this segment increased by 173 million or 19 when compared to the same period in 2013 driven by higher sales across all product lines driving the increase was higher demand for our heavy duty diesel products propelled by new governmental regulations in europe and china and increased demand for class 8 vehicles in north america sales of lightduty diesel products also improved due to higher volume in europe automotive substrate product sales increased due to higher demand in europe and china 

when compared to the same period last year net income in the twelve months ended december 31 2014 improved significantly up 50 million or 38 driven by improvements in manufacturing efficiency and strong volume gains across both automotive and diesel product lines improving market conditions for heavyduty diesel products in europe china and north america and higher european sales of lightduty diesel products combined with an increase in automotive vehicle builds drove the increase higher costs associated with facility expansion projects and an increase in the pension marktomarket adjustment somewhat offset the increase in net income 

  

2013 vs 2012 

when compared to 2012 net sales in the environmental technologies segment decreased in 2013 due to lower sales of lightduty diesel filters and heavyduty diesel products demand for lightduty diesel vehicles which use our filters declined due to weak economic conditions in europe heavyduty diesel product sales were lower due to the decline in the production of class 8 vehicles in north america net sales of this segment in 2013 were not materially impacted by movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2012 

although net sales declined in 2013 when compared to 2012 net income increased by 18 driven by significantly improved manufacturing performance for our automotive and heavyduty diesel products and lower operating expenses net income also included an increase of 8 million due to the positive change in the marktomarket of our defined benefit pension plans 

movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the results of this segment in the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 

core performance 

2014 vs 2013 

when compared to the same period last year core earnings in the twelve months ended december 31 2014 increased by 57 million or 44 driven by improvements in manufacturing efficiency and strong volume gains across both automotive and diesel product lines improving market conditions for heavyduty diesel products in europe china and north america and higher european sales of lightduty diesel products combined with an increase in automotive vehicle builds drove the increase higher costs associated with facility expansion projects somewhat offset the increase in net income 

2013 vs 2012 

although net sales declined in 2013 when compared to 2012 core earnings increased by 9 driven by significantly improved manufacturing performance for our automotive and heavyduty diesel products and lower operating expenses 

the environmental technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of catalyzer and emission control systems manufacturers who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers the use of our substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel vehicle or engine manufacturers for 2014 2013 and 2012 net sales to three customers which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment sales accounted for 88 87 and 86 respectively of total segment sales while we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues with our direct customers our nearterm sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products 

outlook 

we anticipate that environmental technologies sales in the first quarter of 2015 will be consistent when compared to the first quarter of 2014

as reported 

2014 vs 2013 

the specialty materials segment manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs consequently this segment operates in a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets that include display optics and components semiconductor optics components aerospace and defense astronomy ophthalmic products telecommunications components and a protective cover glass that is optimized for portable display devices 

net sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 in the specialty materials segment increased by 35 million or 3 when compared to the same period in 2013 driven by higher sales of our advanced optics and commercial optics products although corning gorilla glass volume increased by 23 net sales remained consistent with the prior year driven by an unfavorable shift in product mix and price declines additionally although volume increased in 2014 when compared to 2013 the growth did not meet our expectations due to the flat market for tablets 

when compared to the same period last year the decrease in net income for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 was driven by the absence of the inventory build we experienced in the first half of 2013 the writeoff a trade receivable balance in the amount of 8 million and price declines for corning gorilla glass partially offsetting the decrease was an increase in volume for both corning gorilla glass and advanced optics products and the impact of costs reductions as a result of restructuring actions 

2013 vs 2012 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2013 decreased in the specialty materials segment when compared to 2012 due to a 17 decline in sales of corning gorilla glass although retail demand for products using our corning gorilla glass has increased in 2013 supply chain variability during which we experienced robust sales of this glass in the latter half of 2012 resulted in a supply chain contraction throughout 2013 advanced optics products sales increased slightly in the year ended december 31 2013 driven by the beginning of a business recovery 

although net sales declined by 13 in the year ended december 31 2013 net income increased by 36 when compared to 2012 due to strong cost controls lower restructuring charges manufacturing cost reduction initiatives and the beginning of the advanced optics products business recovery which partially offset the lower sales of corning gorilla glass the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the us dollar positively impacted net income by approximately 27 million in the year ended december 31 2013 when compared to the same period in the prior year 

movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the results of this segment in the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 

  

core performance 

2014 vs 2013 

when compared to the same period last year the decrease in core earnings in the twelve months ended december 31 2014 was driven by the absence of the inventory build we experienced in the first half of 2013 price declines for corning gorilla glass and higher production costs partially offsetting the decrease was an increase in volume for both corning gorilla glass and advanced optics products and the impact of costs reductions as a result of restructuring actions 

2013 vs 2012 

although core net sales declined by 13 in the year ended december 31 2013 core earnings decreased by only 2 when compared to 2012 due to strong cost controls manufacturing cost reduction initiatives and the beginning of the advanced optics products business recovery which partially offset the lower sales of corning gorilla glass 

for 2014 and 2013 three customers of the specialty materials segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment sales accounted for 51 and 47 respectively of total segment sales for 2012 two customers of the specialty materials segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment sales accounted for 54 of total segment sales 

outlook 

in the first quarter of 2015 specialty materials segment sales are expected to increase by approximately 10 when compared to the first quarter of 2014 as a result of increased gorilla glass demand for products launched in the third and fourth quarters of 2014

net sales for the year ended december 31 2014 increased by 11 million when compared to the same period in the prior year higher sales in north america and china up 12 million and 5 million respectively were offset slightly by lower sales in australia net income remained consistent when compared to the same period in 2013 driven by less favorable product mix and higher operating expenses which were offset by higher volume and lower acquisitionrelated costs due to the completion of the integration of discovery labware business 

2013 vs 2012 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2013 increased when compared to the same period last year due to the impact of the acquisition of the discovery labware business completed in the fourth quarter of 2012 which increased net sales by 192 million net sales of the segment’s existing lines remained relatively consistent 

when compared to the same period in 2012 net income in the year ended december 31 2013 increased substantially driven by a 38 million improvement attributable to the impact of the discovery labware acquisition and the positive impact of 7 million on the change in the marktomarket of our defined benefit pension plans offsetting the gains from discovery labware and the pension marktomarket were an increase in acquisitionrelated costs of 6 million and higher restructuring charges

all other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “all other” this group is primarily comprised of the results of corning precision materials’ nonlcd business and new product lines and development projects that involve the use of various technologies for new products such as advanced flow reactors and adjacency businesses in pursuit of thin strong glass this segment also includes results for certain corporate investments such as eurokera and keraglass equity affiliates which manufacture smooth cooktop glassceramic products 

2014 vs 2013 

the increase in net sales of this segment in the year ended december 31 2014 reflects the consolidation of the corning precision materials’ nonlcd business as a result of the acquisition the increase in the net loss of this segment reflects higher spending for development projects which were not part of the segment in the year ended december 31 2013 

2013 vs 2012 

the increase in segment net loss in 2013 when compared to 2012 was driven by the writedown of assets to their fair value in the amount of 36 million in samsung corning precision materials’ nonlcd glass business the absence of the 2012 gain on the sale of assets in samsung corning precision materials’ nonlcd glass business and restructuring costs of 5 million associated with our global restructuring program implemented in the fourth quarter of 2013 partially offset by lower research development and engineering expenses on development projects the increase in core net loss in 2013 reflects the absence of the 2012 gain on the sale of assets in samsung corning precision materials’ nonlcd glass business and a decline in research development and engineering expenses for development projects 

liquidity and capital resources 

financing and capital structure 

the following items impacted corning’s financing and capital structure during 2014 and 2013 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

common stock dividends 

on december 3 2014 corning’s board of directors declared a 20 increase in the quarterly common stock dividend which increased the quarterly dividend from 010 to 012 per common share beginning with the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2015 this increase marks the fourth dividend increase since october 2011

net cash provided by operating activities increased significantly in the year ended december 31 2014 when compared to the same period last year due to a dividend of approximately 16 billion received from samsung corning precision materials an increase in net income of 511 million and the cash inflows from inventory movements although net inventory increased by 52 million due to the acquisition which added 121 million this inventory was acquired through the issuance of preferred stock cash outflows for inventory declined by 120 million in the base display technologies and specialty materials segments in 2014 when compared to 2013 offset somewhat by an increase of approximately 50 million driven by spending for new business development and increases in the optical communications and life sciences segments 

net cash used in investing activities decreased slightly in the year ended december 31 2014 when compared to the same period last year driven by a decrease in investments in unconsolidated entities the realized gains on our yendenominated purchased collars and the absence of the premium paid for our yendenominated purchased collars in 2013 offset by an increase in shortterm investments 

net cash used in financing activities in the year ended december 31 2014 increased when compared to the same period last year driven by our share repurchase programs and the absence of the proceeds received in 2013 from the issuance of longterm debt somewhat offset by cash received from the issuance of preferred stock and the absence of the retirement of longterm debt in the first quarter of 2013 

2013 vs 2012 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased in the year ended december 31 2013 when compared to the same period last year largely due to a decrease in dividends received from affiliated companies and the unfavorable impact of changes in working capital driven by the following items 

 

 

 

a decline in accounts receivable in the display technologies optical communications and specialty materials segments somewhat offset these unfavorable impacts 

net cash used in investing activities declined in 2013 when compared to 2012 due to a decrease in capital spending lower business acquisition spending and the liquidation of shortterm investments offset by the premium related to our purchased collars 

net cash used in financing activities increased in 2013 when compared to the same period last year driven primarily by the absence of the issuance of longterm debt in the first quarter of 2012 higher share repurchases the retirement of longterm debt in the first quarter of 2013 and higher dividend payments 

defined benefit pension plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees our largest single pension plan is corning’s us qualified plan at december 31 2014 this plan accounted for 77 of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation and 86 of the related plans’ assets 

  

we have historically contributed to the us qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the irs minimum requirements in 2014 we made voluntary cash contributions of 85 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and 45 million to our international pension plans in 2013 we did not contribute to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and contributed 5 million to our international pension plans in 2012 we made voluntary cash contributions of 75 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and 30 million to our international pension plans although we will not be subject to any mandatory contributions in 2015 we anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of up to 65 million to our us pension plan and up to 28 million to our international pension plans in 2015

restructuring 

for the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded charges of 71 million for workforce reductions asset disposals and writeoffs and exit costs for restructuring activities with total cash expenditures estimated to be 51 million 

in the fourth quarter of 2013 corning implemented a global restructuring plan within several of our segments consisting of workforce reductions asset disposals and writeoffs and exit costs we recorded charges of 67 million associated with these actions with total cash expenditures expected to be approximately 40 million 

in 2012 we recorded a charge of 89 million associated with a corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2013 the charge included costs for workforce reductions asset disposals and writeoffs and exit costs total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately 49 million primarily related to termination benefits and were largely finalized in 2013 

during 2014 2013 and 2012 we made payments of 39 million 35 million and 15 million respectively related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions refer to note 2 restructuring impairment and other charges to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

credit ratings 

as of february 13 2015 our credit ratings were as follows 

 

management assessment of liquidity 

we ended the fourth quarter of 2014 with approximately 61 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments the company has adequate sources of liquidity and we are confident in our ability to generate cash to meet existing or reasonably likely future cash requirements our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted although approximately 68 of the consolidated amount was held outside of the us at december 31 2014 we have sufficient us liquidity including borrowing capacity to fund foreseeable us cash needs without requiring the repatriation of foreign cash we utilize a variety of tax effective financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 

from time to time we may issue debt the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes or to refinance certain debt maturities additionally to manage interest rate exposure the company from time to time enters into interest rate swap agreements in the fourth quarter of 2014 the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to an anticipated issuance the instruments were designated as cash flow hedges 

on june 24 2013 the company established a commercial paper program on a private placement basis pursuant to which we may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of 1 billion under this program the company may issue the notes from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes the maturities of the notes will vary but may not exceed 390 days from the date of issue the interest rates will vary based on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the notes by credit rating agencies at the time of issuance the company’s revolving credit facility is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program if needed at december 31 2014 we did not have any outstanding commercial paper under this program 

share repurchase programs 

on october 31 2013 as part of the share repurchase program announced on april 24 2013 the “2013 repurchase program” corning entered into an accelerated share repurchase “asr” agreement with jp morgan chase bank national association london branch “jpmc” under the asr agreement with jpmc corning agreed to purchase 1 billion of its common stock in total with an initial delivery by jpmc of 471 million shares based on the current market price and payment of 1 billion made by corning to jpmc the payment to jpmc was recorded as a reduction to shareholders’ equity consisting of an 800 million increase in treasury stock which reflects the value of the initial 471 million shares received upon execution and a 200 million decrease in otherpaidin capital which reflects the value of the stock held back by jpmc pending final settlement on january 28 2014 the asr agreement with jpmc was completed corning received an additional 105 million shares on january 31 2014 to settle the asr agreement in total corning purchased 576 million shares based on the average daily volume weightedaverage price of corning’s common stock during the term of the asr agreement with jpmc less a discount 

in addition to the shares repurchased through the asr agreement we repurchased 613 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately 10 billion as part of the 2013 repurchase program this program was executed between the second quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014 with a total of 1189 million shares repurchased for approximately 2 billion 

  

on march 4 2014 as part of the 2 billion share repurchase program announced on october 22 2013 and made effective concurrent with the closing of corning’s acquisition of samsung corning precision materials on january 15 2014 the “2014 repurchase program” corning entered into an asr agreement with citibank na “citi” under the asr agreement with citi corning agreed to purchase 125 billion of its common stock with an initial delivery by citi of 525 million shares based on the current market price and payment of 125 billion made by corning to citi on may 28 2014 the asr agreement with citi was completed and corning received an additional 87 million shares to settle the asr agreement in total corning repurchased 612 million shares based on the average daily volume weightedaverage price of corning’s common stock during the term of the asr agreement with citi less a discount 

in addition to the shares repurchased through the asr agreement in the year ended december 31 2014 we repurchased 369 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately 750 million as part of the 2014 repurchase program this program was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 with a total of 982 million shares repurchased for approximately 2 billion 

on december 3 2014 corning’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15 billion shares of common stock between the date of announcement and december 31 2016 no shares were repurchased under this program between the date of authorization and december 31 2014 

other 

we complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk we closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues we currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues 

our major source of funding for 2015 and beyond will be our operating cash flow and our existing balances of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and proceeds from any issuances of debt we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations share repurchase programs acquisitions the asbestos litigation research and development capital expenditures scheduled debt repayments and dividend payments 

corning also has access to a 2 billion unsecured committed revolving credit facility this credit facility includes a leverage ratio financial covenant the required leverage ratio which measures debt to total capital is a maximum of 50 at december 31 2014 our leverage using this measure was 13 and we are in compliance with the financial covenant 

our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events in addition some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision whereby an uncured default in excess of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the company also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument as of december 31 2014 we were in compliance with all such provisions 

management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands commitments events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in our liquidity in addition other than items discussed there are no known material trends favorable or unfavorable in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources 

purchased collars and average rate forwards 

in the first quarter of 2013 corning executed a series of purchased collars that expire quarterly across a twoyear period to hedge its translation exposure resulting from movements in the japanese yen against the us dollar these derivatives are not designated as accounting hedges and changes in fair value are recorded in other income immediately the fair value of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets gain position or liabilities loss position on the consolidated balance sheet 

  

beginning in the second quarter of 2013 and continuing throughout 2014 corning entered into a series of average rate forwards with no associated premium which hedge the translation impact of japanese yen on corning’s projected 2015 net income and a significant portion of corning’s projected 2016 and 2017 net income like the purchased collars these contracts settle quarterly and are not designated as accounting hedges in the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 we recorded pretax net gains of 1406 million and 435 million respectively related to changes in the fair value of the purchased collars and average rate forward contracts offset slightly by premium expense included in these amounts are realized gains of 344 million and 110 million respectively for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 the gross notional value outstanding for purchase collars and average rate forwards which hedge our exposure to the japanese yen at december 31 2014 and 2013 was 98 billion and 68 billion respectively 

in the second quarter of 2014 following the acquisition we entered into a portfolio of zero cost collars to hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the korean won and its impact on our net earnings these zero cost collars have a gross notional value outstanding at december 31 2014 of 23 billion and began settling quarterly in the third quarter of 2014 and will conclude at the end of 2015 in the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded a pretax net loss of 37 million related to changes in the fair value of these zero cost collars which included 6 million in realized losses 

gains and losses related to purchased collars and average rate forwards are recorded in earnings in the other income net line of the consolidated statements of income 

off balance sheet arrangements 

off balance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 

corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include guarantee contracts at the time a guarantee is issued the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant 

refer to note 14 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

for variable interest entities we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of its expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests which are the ownership contractual or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests 

corning has identified one entity that qualifies as a variable interest entity this entity is not considered to be significant to corning’s consolidated statements of position 

corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit liquidity or market risk support to that entity

we are required at the time a guarantee is issued to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant 

we believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 

environment 

corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by the agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2014 and 2013 corning had accrued approximately 425 million undiscounted and 15 million undiscounted respectively for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 

  

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates that required us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates are set forth below 

impairment of assets held for use 

we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified we review our longlived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 

manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals primarily platinum and rhodium these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of longlived assets this review considers all of the company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process in reclamation fabrication or refinement in anticipation of reuse or awaiting use to support increased capacity precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other nonmanufacturing related purposes 

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include but are not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for the majority of our reportable segments we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

for longlived assets when impairment indicators are present we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used assessments also consider changes in asset utilization including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 

for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability described above the estimated fair value of longlived assets is determined using an “income approach” “market approach” “cost approach” or a combination of one or more of these approaches as appropriate for the particular asset group being reviewed all of these approaches start with the forecast of expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of longlived assets and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals if appropriate for the asset group being reviewed some of the more significant estimates and assumptions in our analysis include market size and growth market share projected selling prices manufacturing cost and discount rate our estimates are based upon our historical experience our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

  

in the event the current net book value of an asset group is found to be greater than the net present value of the cash flows derived from the asset group we determine the actual fair market value of longlived assets with the assistance from valuation appraisals conducted by third parties the results of these valuations generally represent the fair market value of the asset group that will remain after any necessary impairment adjustments have been recorded the impairment charge will be allocated to assets within the asset group on a relative fair value basis 

at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by 222 million and 164 million respectively these precious metals are utilized by the display technologies and specialty materials segments corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments the potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments such events include but are not limited to a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our display technologies or specialty materials segments 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 the specialty materials segment recorded an impairment charge in the amount of 130 million related to certain assets used in the production of large cover glass due to sales that were significantly below our expectations in the fourth quarter of 2012 after reassessing the large cover glass business corning concluded that the large cover glass market was developing differently in 2012 than our expectations and demand for largersized cover glass was declining and the market for this type of glass was instead targeting smaller gen size products additionally in the fourth quarter of 2012 our primary customer of large cover glass notified corning of its decision to exit from this display market based on these events we recorded an additional impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the amount of 44 million before tax this impairment charge represents a writedown of assets specific to the glassstrengthening process for large size cover glass to their fair market values and includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process additional information on the asset impairment is found in note 2 restructuring impairment and other charges to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment of goodwill 

we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units 

corning’s goodwill relates primarily to the display technologies optical communications specialty materials and life sciences operating segments on a quarterly basis management performs a qualitative assessment of factors in each reporting unit to determine whether there have been any triggering events the twostep impairment test is required only if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount we perform a detailed twostep process every three years if no indicators suggest a test should be performed in the interim we use this calculation as quantitative validation of the stepzero qualitative process that is performed during the intervening periods and does not represent an election to perform the twostep process in place of the stepzero review 

the following summarizes our qualitative process to assess our goodwill balances for impairment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the examples noted above are not allinclusive and the company will consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test 

  

our twostep goodwill recoverability assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the longterm growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows our valuation method is an “income approach” using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return our estimates are based upon our historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends 

display technologies 

goodwill for the display technologies segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level on a quarterly basis in 2014 management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the display technologies reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount 

optical communications 

goodwill for the optical communications segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level on a quarterly basis in 2014 management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the optical communications reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount 

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2012 for this reporting unit the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount a discount rate of 9 was used in 2012 we determined a range of discount rates between 7 and 11 would not have affected our conclusion 

specialty materials 

goodwill for the specialty materials segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is one level below an operating segment as goodwill is the result of transactions associated with certain businesses within this operating segment there is only one reporting unit with goodwill within this operating segment on a quarterly basis in 2014 management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the specialty materials reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount 

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2012 for this reporting unit the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount a discount rate of 8 was used in 2012 we determined a range of discount rates between 6 and 10 would not have affected our conclusion additionally the asset impairment which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 did not cause a triggering event for goodwill impairment in this reporting unit because the cash flow related to this lower level asset group is not material to this reporting unit 

life sciences 

goodwill for the life sciences segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level on a quarterly basis in 2014 management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the life sciences reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount 

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2012 for this reporting unit the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount a discount rate of 7 was used in 2012 we determined a range of discount rates between 5 and 9 would not have affected our conclusion 

restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions 

we are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including for example employee termination costs restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses of portions thereof their profitability cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome the judgment involved can be difficult subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses 

  

restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which as a result require impairment we are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned 

income taxes 

we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environments in which we do business it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances 

corning accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb asc topic 740 income taxes as required under fasb asc topic 740 we only record tax benefits for technical positions that we believe have a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement in estimating these amounts we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue a particular position or alternatively consider a negotiated compromise and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position as a result it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates 

equity method investments 

in october 2013 corning announced that it was entering into a series of strategic and financial agreements with samsung display which would result in corning obtaining full ownership of samsung corning precision materials as part of this agreement in the fourth quarter of 2013 corning acquired the minority interests of three shareholders in samsung corning precision materials for 506 million which included payment for the transfer of nonoperating assets and the prorata portion of cash on samsung corning precision materials balance sheet at september 30 2013 the resulting transfer of shares to corning increased corning’s ownership percentage of samsung corning precision materials from 50 to 575 because this transaction did not result in a change in control based on the governing articles of this entity corning did not consolidate this entity as of december 31 2013 the remaining transactions were completed on january 15 2014 which increased corning’s ownership to 100 and resulted in consolidation of the entity beginning in the first quarter of 2014 this organization was integrated into corning’s display technologies segment in 2014 refer to note 8 acquisition to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

at december 31 2014 and 2013 the carrying value of our equity method investments was 18 billion and 55 billion respectively in 2014 our largest equity method investment dow corning comprised 74 of the balance in 2013 prior to the acquisition and consolidation of samsung corning precision materials our largest equity method investments dow corning and samsung corning precision materials comprised approximately 93 of the balance we review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if events or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be otherthantemporarily impaired when such indicators are present we then perform an indepth review for impairment an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability forecasted tax rates foreign currency exchange rate movements terminal value assumptions historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends as of december 31 2014 and 2013 we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable 

fair value measures 

as required corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the company’s own market assumptions once inputs have been characterized we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement in addition observable market data must be used when available and the highestandbestuse measure should be applied to nonfinancial assets corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are shortterm and longterm investments certain pension asset investments and derivatives these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions 

  

derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in arriving at the fair value of corning’s derivative assets and liabilities we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction amounts related to credit risk are not material 

as a result of the acquisition of samsung corning precision materials the company has contingent consideration that was measured using unobservable level 3 inputs this contingent consideration arrangement potentially requires additional consideration to be paid between the parties in 2018 one based on projections of future revenues generated by the business of corning precision materials for the period between the acquisition date and december 31 2017 which is subject to a cap of 665 million and another based on the volumes of certain sales during the same period which is subject to a separate cap of 100 million the fair value of the potential receipt of the contingent consideration in 2018 in the amount of 196 million recognized on the acquisition date was estimated by applying an option pricing model using the company’s projection of future revenues generated by corning precision materials changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration in future periods are valued using an option pricing model and are recorded in corning’s results in the period of the change as of december 31 2014 the fair value of the potential receipt of the contingent consideration in 2018 is estimated to be 445 million corning recorded a pretax adjustment in the year ended december 31 2014 in the amount of 249 million to reflect the increase in the fair value which is mainly due to the movement in foreign exchange rate 

probability of litigation outcomes 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter case law and other casespecific issues see part ii – item 3 legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face the most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability including the inherent complexity of a chapter 11 filing our history of success in defending asbestos claims our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses and our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants’ representatives the proposed asbestos resolution amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies as noted in part ii – item 3 legal proceedings the district court’s affirmation of the amended pcc plan faces objections by certain parties for these and other reasons corning’s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters the estimate of the cost of resolving the nonpcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning’s financial statements is remote 

other possible liabilities 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters including certain tax planning and environmental matters these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 

pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb 

corning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company’s assumptions related to general economic conditions particularly interest rates expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates the cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements mortality turnover and plan participation 

costs for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements 1 ongoing costs recognized quarterly which are comprised of service and interest costs expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs and 2 marktomarket gains and losses outside of the corridor where the corridor is equal to 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets at the beginning of the year which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year these gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment settlement or significant plan changes as well as any trueup to the annual valuation are recognized as a marktomarket adjustment in the quarter in which such event occurs 

  

costs for our opeb plans consist of ongoing costs recognized quarterly and are comprised of service and interest costs amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses we recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates as a component of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor 

while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s employee pension and other postretirement obligations and current and future expense 

the following table presents our actual and expected return on assets as well as the corresponding percentage for the years ended 2014 2013 and 2012 

 

as of december 31 2014 the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was 3222 million 

the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans 

 

the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning’s funding requirements 

in addition at december 31 2014 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders’ equity by 116 million before tax and a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders’ equity by 113 million in addition the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to corning’s us opeb plans 

 

 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo 

  

the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned in certain instances revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns allowances discounts and other factors these estimates are supported by historical data corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue on a completed contract basis revenues under the completedcontract method are recognized upon substantial completion defined as acceptance by the customer and compliance with performance specifications as agreed upon in the contract which in certain instances require estimates and judgments in the determining the timing of substantial completion of the contract while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning’s future results 

sharebased compensation 

sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates sharebased compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects 

 

 

our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the japanese yen south korean won new taiwan dollar chinese renminbi and the euro we seek to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using overthecounter otc derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts typically with durations of 36 months or less in general these hedges expire coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions 

we are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts however we minimize this risk by maintaining a diverse group of highlyrated major international financial institutions with which we have other financial relationships as our counterparties we do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments 

our cash flow hedging activities utilize otc foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers we also use otc foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the undesignated hedges limit exposures to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies a significant portion of the company’s nonus revenues are denominated in japanese yen when these revenues are translated back to us dollars the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements in the japanese yen to protect translated earnings against movements in the japanese yen the company has entered into a series of purchased collars and average rate forwards 

we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2014 with respect to open foreign exchange forward and option contracts and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 1080 million compared to 479 million at december 31 2013 specific to the japanese yen a 10 adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 959 million compared to 398 million at december 31 2013 specific to the south korean won a 10 adverse movement in quoted south korean won exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 79 million compared to 0 million at december 31 2013 

as we derive approximately 73 of our net sales from outside the us our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies most notably the japanese yen south korean won and euro our forecasts generally assume exchange rates during 2015 will remain constant at january 2015 levels as an example of the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our financial results we compare 2014 actual sales in yen won and euro transaction currencies at an average currency exchange rate during the year to a 10 change in the currency exchange rate a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2014 net sales of approximately 384 million a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – south korean won and us dollar – euro exchange rates would result in a change to 2014 net sales of approximately 4 million and 100 million respectively we estimate that a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2014 net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately 238 million a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – south korean won and us dollar – euro exchange rates would result in a change to 2014 net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately 73 million and 31 million respectively 

interest rate risk management 

it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates we are party to two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of 550 million of previously issued fixed rate longterm debt to floating rate debt under the terms of the swap agreements we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the onemonth libor rate 

  

from time to time we may issue debt the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes or to refinance certain debt maturities additionally to manage interest rate exposure the company from time to time enters into interest rate swap agreements in the fourth quarter of 2014 the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to an anticipated issuance the instruments were designated as cash flow hedges

corning seeks to maintain a competitive advantage by emphasizing product quality product availability supply chain efficiency a wide product line and superior product attributes our principle worldwide competitors include greiner nunc kimblechase gibco and duran corning also faces increasing competition from two large distributors that have pursued backward integration or introduced private label products

 

raw materials

 

corning’s production of specialty glasses ceramics and related materials requires significant quantities of energy uninterrupted power sources certain precious metals and various batch materials

 

although energy shortages have not been a problem recently the cost of energy remains volatile corning has achieved flexibility through engineering changes to take advantage of lowcost energy sources in most significant processes specifically many of corning’s principal manufacturing processes can be operated with natural gas propane oil or electricity or a combination of these energy sources

 

availability of resources ores minerals polymers helium and processed chemicals required in manufacturing operations appears to be adequate corning’s suppliers from time to time may experience capacity limitations in their own operations or may eliminate certain product lines corning believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch materials and precious metals for many products corning has alternate glass compositions that would allow operations to continue without interruption in the event of specific materials shortages

 

certain key materials and proprietary equipment used in the manufacturing of products are currently solesourced or available only from a limited number of suppliers any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in lost sales due to delays or reductions in product shipments or reductions in corning’s gross margins

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

we operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends

 

as a multinational company we face many risks which could adversely impact our ongoing operations and reported financial results 

 

we operate in over 100 countries and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from and have significant operations outside of the united states our international operations include manufacturing assembly sales customer support and shared administrative service centers

 

compliance with laws and regulations increases our cost of doing business these laws and regulations include us laws and local laws which include data privacy requirements employment and labor laws tax laws anticompetition regulations prohibitions on payments to governmental officials import and trade restrictions and export requirements noncompliance and violations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties

 

 



we are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a multinational global organization including those related to

 

  

our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or circumstances of one or more key customers leading to the substantial reduction in orders for our products 

 

in 2013 corning’s ten largest customers accounted for 50 of our sales

 

in addition a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in our reportable segments for 2013 four customers of the display technologies segment accounted for 94 of total segment net sales when combined in the optical communications segment one customer accounted for 10 of segment net sales in the environmental technologies segment three customers accounted for 87 of total segment sales in aggregate in the specialty materials segment three customers accounted for 47 of segment sales in 2013 in the life sciences segment two customers accounted for 44 of segment sales in 2013 as a result of mergers and consolidations between customers corning’s customer base could become more concentrated

 

samsung corning precision materials’ sales were also concentrated in 2013 with sales to two lcd panel makers located in south korea accounting for approximately 92 of total samsung corning precision materials sales

 

our optical communications segment customers’ purchases of our products are affected by their capital expansion plans general market and economic uncertainty and regulatory changes including broadband policy sales in the optical communications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of fibertothepremises deployments our sales will be dependent on planned targets for homes passed and connected changes in our customers’ deployment plans could adversely affect future sales

 

in the environmental technologies segment sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for automotive and diesel emissions tend to fluctuate with vehicle production changes in laws and regulations for air quality and emission controls may also influence future sales sales in our environmental technologies segment are mainly to three catalyzers and emission system control manufacturers our customers sell these systems to automobile and diesel engine original equipment manufacturers sales in this segment may be affected by adverse developments in the global vehicle or freight hauling industries or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicle sales or downturns in freight traffic

 

certain sales in our specialty materials segment track worldwide economic cycles and our customers’ responses to those cycles in addition any positive trends in prior years in the sales of strengthened glass may not continue we may experience losses relating to our inability to supply contracted quantities of this glass and processes planned to produce new versions of this glass may not be successful

 

 



sales in our life sciences segment are concentrated with two large distributors who are also competitors and the balance is to a variety of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies hospitals universities and other research facilities in 2013 our two largest distributors accounted for 44 of life sciences’ segment sales changes in our distribution arrangements in this segment may adversely affect this segment’s financial results

 

our operations and financial performance could be negatively impacted if the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate 

 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies evolving industry or regulatory standards and new product introductions our success is dependent on the successful introduction of new products or upgrades of current products and our ability to compete with new technologies the following factors related to our products and markets if they do not continue as in the recent past could have an adverse impact on our operations

 

   

we face pricing pressures in each of our businesses that could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

we face pricing pressure in each of our businesses as a result of intense competition emerging technologies or overcapacity while we work consistently toward reducing our costs to offset pricing pressures we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or sustain our current rate of cost reduction we anticipate pricing pressures will continue in the future in all our businesses

 

any of these items could cause our sales profitability and cash flows to be significantly reduced

 

we face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations 

 

because we have significant customers and operations outside the us fluctuations in foreign currencies especially the japanese yen new taiwan dollar korean won and euro affect our sales profit and cash flows foreign exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the us dollar and japanese yen sales in our display technologies segment representing 32 of corning’s sales in 2013 are denominated in japanese yen if sales grow in our display technologies segment our exposure to currency fluctuations will increase corning hedges significant transaction and balance sheet currency exposures and uses derivative instruments to limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities as well as operating results although we selectively hedge these items changes in exchange rates especially the japanese yen to us dollar will significantly impact our reported revenues and profits

 

a large portion of our consolidated operations are international and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures net of gains or losses from our hedging programs for example we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures or should we elect not to hedge certain of our foreign currency exposures we have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with foreign currency exposures as a part of this program we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in the value of our foreign currency exposures are at least partially offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions we are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts however we minimize this risk by limiting the counterparties to a diverse group of highlyrated major international financial institutions with which we have other financial relationships we do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors all of these factors could materially impact our results of operations anticipated future results financial position and cash flows the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control

 

 



if the financial condition of our customers declines our credit risks could increase 

 

although we have a rigorous process to administer credit and believe our bad debt reserve is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable if our customers or our indirect customers fail to meet their payment obligations for our products we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amounts reserved many customers of our display technologies and specialty materials segments are thinly capitalized andor unprofitable in our environmental technologies segment the us auto makers and certain of their suppliers have encountered credit downgrades or have filed for bankruptcy protection in our optical communications segment certain large infrastructure projects are subject to governmental funding which if terminated could adversely impact the financial strength of our customers these factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business

 

the success of our business depends on our ability to develop and produce advantaged products that meet our customers’ needs 

 

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our customers oems and distributors this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to manage and maintain key customer relationships our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers the manufacturing of our products involves complex and precise processes in some cases existing manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the requirements of our customers we will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to maintain profitable operations while we continue to fund projects to improve our manufacturing techniques and processes and lower our costs we may not achieve satisfactory manufacturing costs that will fully enable us to meet our profitability targets

 

in addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on our ability to innovate with respect to both products and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations failure to continue to deliver quality and competitive products to the marketplace to adequately protect our intellectual property rights to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

our future financial performance depends on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials precious metals parts and manufacturing equipment to meet the demands of our customers 

 

our ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials precious metals parts and components from our suppliers we may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages there can be no assurances that we will not encounter problems in the future furthermore certain manufacturing equipment raw materials or components are available only from a single source or limited sources we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner a reduction interruption or delay of supply or a significant increase in the price for supplies such as manufacturing equipment precious metals raw materials or energy could have a material adverse effect on our businesses

 

we have incurred and may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 

 

at december 31 2013 corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of 1542 million while we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe or if acquisitions and investments made by the company fail to achieve expected returns

 

if our products including materials purchased from our suppliers experience performance issues our business will suffer 

 

our business depends on the production of products of consistently high quality our products components and materials purchased from our suppliers are typically tested for quality these testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios for various reasons our products including materials purchased from our suppliers may fail to perform as a customer expected in some cases product redesigns or additional expense may be required to address such issues a significant or systemic quality issue could result in customer relations problems lost sales reduced volumes product recalls and financial damages and penalties

 

 



we operate in a highly competitive environment 

 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on the company’s share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace the company competes on the basis of product attributes customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or unexpected emerging technologies or products we expect that we will face continuous competition from existing competitors low cost manufacturers and new entrants we believe we must invest in research and development engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities and continue to improve customer service in order to remain competitive we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position

 

we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 

 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses particularly lcd glass and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices if our competitors offer significant discounts on certain products or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to retain our customers and market positions any such changes may reduce our profitability and cash flow any broadbased change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as we implement and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies if we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand our revenues could decrease

 

lcd glass generates a significant amount of the company’s profits and cash flow and any events that adversely affect the market for lcd glass substrates could have a material and negative impact on our financial results 

 

corning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the level of profitability of our lcd glass business as a result any event that adversely affects our display business could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial results these events could include loss of patent protection increased costs associated with manufacturing and increased competition from the introduction of new and more desirable products if any of these events had a material adverse effect on the sales of our lcd glass such an event could result in material charges and a significant reduction in profitability

 

additionally emerging material technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications including display glass cover glass and others resulting in a decline in demand for our products existing or new production capacity for glass substrates may exceed the demand for them technologies for displays cover glass and other applications in competition with our glass may reduce or eliminate the need for our glass substrates new process technologies developed by our competitors may also place us at a cost or quality disadvantage our own process technologies may be acquired or used unlawfully by others enabling them to compete with us our inability to manufacture glass substrates to the specifications required by our customers may result in loss of revenue margins and profits or liabilities for failure to supply a scarcity of resources limitations on technology personnel or other factors resulting in a failure to produce commercial quantities of glass substrates could have adverse financial consequences to us

 

changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors including

 

  

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals

 

 



we may have additional tax liabilities 

 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made

 

a significant amount of our net profits and cash flows are generated from outside the us and certain repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that could significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form proposed legislation may pass if enacted certain antideferral proposals could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow

 

our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees 

 

the loss of the services of any of our key research and development engineering or operational personnel or senior management without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance

 

we are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations 

 

various stages in some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste waste water other industrial waste or greenhouse gases and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of such substances we have installed antipollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities we have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations however we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps toward adopting more stringent environment standards

 

any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us or the suspensioncessation of production or operations in addition environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

 

changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the us and other countries such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and co 2 abatement may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by among other things substantially increasing manufacturing costs limiting availability of scarce resources especially energy or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers

 

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

 

we rely on patent and trade secret laws copyright trademark confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses we cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property worldwide may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of or the unauthorized use of our intellectual property litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently uncertain and the outcome is often unpredictable other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive

 

 



the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products we periodically receive notices from or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights andor breach of our agreements with them these third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design manufacture or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us we cannot provide assurance as to the outcome of any such claims

 

current or future litigation may harm our financial condition or results of operations 

 

as described in legal proceedings in this form 10k we are engaged in litigation and regulatory matters litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain and adverse rulings could occur resulting in significant liabilities penalties or damages such current or future substantial legal liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation

 

we may not capture significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all 

 

developing our products through research and development is expensive and the investment often involves a long return on investment cycle we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by increases in our gross margin we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position

 

business disruptions could affect our operating results 

 

a significant portion of our manufacturing research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas a major earthquake fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future financial results could be materially and adversely affected

 

additionally a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our display technologies segment is concentrated in three overseas countries and it is reasonably possible that the operations of one or more such facilities could be disrupted due to the specialized nature of the assets and the customers’ locations it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from facilities in other countries accordingly loss of these facilities could produce a nearterm severe impact on our display business and the company as a whole

 

we face risks through equity affiliates that we do not control 

 

corning’s net income includes equity earnings from affiliated companies for the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized 547 million of equity earnings of which approximately 94 came from our two largest investments dow corning which makes silicone and high purity polycrystalline products and samsung corning precision materials which primarily makes lcd glass in january 2014 corning completed a series of transactions which resulted in the company obtaining 100 ownership of samsung corning precision materials which will result in control of the entity beginning in the first quarter of 2014

 

our equity investments may not continue to perform at the same levels as in recent years dow corning emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2004 and has certain obligations under its plan of reorganization to resolve and fund claims of its creditors and personal injury claimants dow corning may incur further bankruptcy charges in the future which may adversely affect its operations or assets dow corning also could be adversely impacted by a continuation of significant price declines at their consolidated subsidiary hemlock semiconductor group in addition we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may adversely affect us

 

 



we may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us 

 

we face the risk of loss resulting from product liability asbestos securities fiduciary liability intellectual property antitrust contractual warranty environmental fraud and other lawsuits whether or not such claims are valid in addition our product liability fiduciary directors and officers property policies including business interruption natural catastrophe and comprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect in the future a successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us to make substantial unplanned payments some of the carriers in our historical primary and excess insurance programs are in liquidation and may not be able to respond if we should have claims reaching their policies the financial health of other insurers may deteriorate several of our insurance carriers are litigating with us the extent if any of their obligation to provide insurance coverage for asbestos liabilities asserted against us the results of that litigation may adversely affect our insurance coverage for those risks in addition we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain types of risk such as political risks terrorism or war

 

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

 

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted

 

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our continued operation and expansion outside the united states including in developing countries could increase the risk of such violations violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition

 

moreover several of our equity affiliates and related partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws rules and business practices that differ from those in the united states although we strive to select equity partners and affiliates who share our values and understand our reporting requirements as a usdomiciled company and to ensure that an appropriate business culture exists within these ventures to minimize and mitigate our risk we nonetheless face the reputational and legal risk that our equity partners and affiliates may violate applicable laws rules and business practices

 

acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business 

 

we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment or that we experience difficulty integrating new employees business systems and technology or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits such as increased revenue and cash flow enhanced efficiencies or market share or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized these events could harm our operating results or financial condition

 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation 

 

we store and process personallyidentifiable information of our employees and in some case our customers at the same time the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of the increasingly hostile information security environment this environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies despite these efforts it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue

 

 



significant macroeconomic events changes in regulations or a crisis in the financial markets could limit our access to capital 

 

we utilize credit in both the capital markets and from banks to facilitate company borrowings hedging transactions leases and other financial transactions we maintain a 1 billion revolving credit agreement to fund potential liquidity needs and to backstop certain transactions an adverse macroeconomic event or changes in bank regulations could limit our ability to gain access to credit or to renew the revolving credit agreement upon expiration additionally a financial markets crisis may limit our ability to access liquidity

 

adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our cash investments 

 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various types of securities with varying maturities and credit quality these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that have affected global financial markets we also make significant investments in us government securities either directly or through investment in money market funds if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline or if the us defaults on its debt obligations or its debt is downgraded our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely impact our financial results

 

information technology dependency and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue liability claims or competitive harm 

 

the company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure any significant breakdown intrusion interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

we use electronic information technology it in our manufacturing processes and operations and other aspects of our business despite our implementation of security measures our it systems are vulnerable to disruptions from computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized access cyber attack and other similar disruptions a material breach in the security of our it systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets such disruptions or security breaches could result in the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business like other global companies we have from time to time experienced incidents related to our it systems and expect that such incidents will continue including malware and computer virus attacks unauthorized access systems failures and disruptions we have measures and defenses in place against unauthorized access but we may not be able to prevent immediately detect or remediate such events

 

additionally utilities and other operators of critical energy infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks including cyber attacks in the event of such an attack disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power electrical gas etc

 

international trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position 

 

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us including our equity affiliatesjoint ventures from being able to sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations these policies also affect our equity companies

pcc plan of reorganization 

 

corning with other relevant parties has been involved in ongoing efforts to develop a plan of reorganization that would resolve the concerns and objections of the relevant courts and parties on november 12 2013 the bankruptcy court issued a decision finally confirming an amended pcc plan of reorganization the “amended pcc plan” or the “plan”

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

organization of information 

 

management’s discussion and analysis provides a historical and prospective narrative on the company’s financial condition and results of operations this discussion includes the following sections

 

  

overview 

 

although corning’s net sales remained relatively consistent in 2013 when compared to 2012 net income improved by 20 driven by the impact of the net gain on our yendenominated hedging program an increase in equity earnings from dow corning and higher net income in our optical communications specialty materials life sciences and environmental technologies segments

 

net sales in the year ended december 31 2013 were 7819 million compared to 8012 million in the year ended december 31 2012 when compared to 2012 the change in net sales was driven by the following items

 

  

for the year ended december 31 2013 we generated net income of 20 billion or 134 per share compared to net income of 16 billion or 109 per share for 2012 when compared to last year the increase in net income was due largely to the following items all amounts presented after tax

 

  

partially offsetting the increase in net income in the year ended december 31 2013 were the negative impacts of the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the us dollar price declines in the midteens in the display technologies segment and an increase in the effective tax rate largely driven by higher income in the us tax law changes and the recording of valuation allowances due to changes in the realization of certain foreign and state deferred tax assets

 

 



corning remains committed to a strategy of growing through global innovation this strategy has served us well our key priorities for 2013 were similar to those in prior years protect our financial health and invest in the future during 2013 we made the following progress on these priorities

 

financial health 

 

our financial position remained sound and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities significant items in 2013 included the following

 

  

investing in our future 

 

we continue to focus on the future and on what we do best – creating keystone components that enable hightechnology systems we remain committed to investing in research development and engineering to drive innovation during 2014 we will maintain our balanced innovation strategy of growing our existing businesses developing opportunities adjacent or closely related to our existing technical and manufacturing capabilities and investing in longrange opportunities in each of our market segments our spending levels for research development and engineering declined slightly in 2013 when compared to 2012 and were approximately 9 of sales

 

we continue to work on new products including glass substrates for high performance displays and lcd applications diesel filters and substrates for emission control systems glass and plastic labware and the optical fiber cable and hardware and equipment that enable fibertothepremises and next generation data centers in addition we are focusing on wireless solutions for diverse venue applications such as distributed antenna systems fiber to the cell site and fiber to the antenna we have focused our research development and engineering spending to support the advancement of new product attributes for our corning gorilla glass suite of products we will continue to focus on adjacent glass and ceramic opportunities which leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes including corning willow glass our ultraslim flexible glass substrate for use in nextgeneration consumer electronic technologies

 

capital spending was 1019 million in 2013 a decrease of 782 million when compared to 2012 in 2011 corning announced several multiyear investment plans to increase manufacturing capacity in several of our reportable segments specifically the projects focused on an lcd glass substrate facility in china for our display technologies segment and a capacity expansion project for specialty materials’ corning gorilla glass in japan although spending for these projects continued into 2013 the majority of the construction costs were incurred in 2012 and 2011 resulting in a significant decrease in capital spending in those segments in 2013 we expect our 2014 capital expenditures to be approximately 15 billion approximately 600 million will be allocated to our display technologies segment

 

corporate outlook 

 

our recent acquisition of the remaining interest in our equity affiliate samsung corning precision materials will drive growth in 2014 we also expect sales to grow in our optical communications life sciences specialty materials and environmental technologies segments and for our market share to stabilize and price declines to be moderate in our display technologies segment we anticipate a rise in global demand for corning’s carrier network products combined with growth of enterprise network products will increase sales in our optical communications segment we believe the overall lcd glass retail market in 2014 will increase in the midtohigh single digits driven by the combination of an increase in retail sales of lcd televisions and the demand for larger television screen sizes net income may be negatively impacted by lower equity earnings from our equity affiliate dow corning and the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates we may take advantage of acquisition opportunities that support the longterm strategies of our businesses we remain confident that our strategy to grow through global innovation while preserving our financial stability will enable our continued longterm success

 

 



results of operations 

 

selected highlights from our continuing operations follow dollars in millions

 

   

net sales 

 

for the year ended december 31 2013 net sales remained relatively consistent when compared to the same period in 2012 higher sales in the optical communications and life sciences segments were offset by declines in the display technologies environmental technologies and specialty materials segments optical communications sales increased by 196 million driven by an increase in sales of our carrier products in the amount of 163 million largely due to the rampup of the fibertothepremises initiative in australia which increased by 28 million an increase of 23 million in sales of wireless products and higher sales of fiber and cable products in north america china and europe up 52 million 33 million and 26 million respectively also included in the increase in sales of carrier products is the impact of a small acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2013 and the consolidation of an investment due to a change in control which added approximately 53 million in 2013 net sales increased in the life sciences segment by 194 million driven by the impact of the acquisition of the discovery labware business in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the display technologies segment volume increases in the midtwenties in percentage terms were more than offset by price declines in the midteens and the impact of the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the us dollar in the environmental technologies segment while automotive product sales remained relatively consistent with the prior year sales of our diesel products declined by 9 net sales declined by 176 million in the specialty materials segment driven by a decline in sales of corning gorilla glass of 17

 

 



net sales in 2012 increased slightly when compared to the prior year due to sales growth in the specialty materials optical communications and life sciences segments offset almost entirely by a decrease in sales in our display technologies segment sales in the specialty materials segment increased by 25 due to the strong demand for corning gorilla glass that is used as cover glass in portable handheld display devices tablets and notebook computers optical communications segment sales increased primarily due to sales growth in wireless and fibertothepremises products the increase in sales in our life sciences segment was driven by the acquisition of the discovery labware business in the fourth quarter of 2012 and by the small acquisition we completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 which produces highquality cell culture media additionally net sales were positively impacted by movements in foreign exchange rates

 

in 2013 2012 and 2011 sales into international markets accounted for 74 77 and 79 respectively of total net sales

 

cost of sales 

 

the types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are raw materials consumption including direct and indirect materials salaries wages and benefits depreciation and amortization production utilities productionrelated purchasing warehousing including receiving and inspection repairs and maintenance interlocation inventory transfer costs production and warehousing facility property insurance rent for production facilities and other production overhead

 

gross margin 

 

for 2013 gross margin dollars and as a percentage of sales increased when compared to 2012 led by an increase of 6 in the specialty materials segment resulting from improvements in manufacturing efficiency and cost reduction programs the depreciation of the japanese yen versus the us dollar and price declines in the display technologies segment partially offset the increase

 

for 2012 gross margin in dollars and as a percentage of sales decreased when compared to 2011 due to the impact of significant price declines in our display technologies segment partially offsetting this decline was improvement in our specialty materials segment where significantly higher sales increased manufacturing efficiency and the absence of large cover glass startup and tank conversion costs incurred in 2011 led to an 11 increase in gross margin

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2013 decreased by 79 million when compared to 2012 this decrease was largely driven by cost control measures implemented in our segments and a decline in variable compensation in the amount of 27 million as a percentage of net sales these expenses decreased when compared to the same period last year

 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2012 increased when compared to 2011 due primarily to an increase in performancebased compensation costs expenses associated with the acquisition of the bd discovery labware business and the absence of a credit in the amount of 27 million resulting from a reduction in a contingent liability associated with an acquisition recorded in 2011 as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses in 2012 increased when compared to 2011 due to the increase in spending described above and relatively consistent net sales year over year

 

the types of expenses included in the selling general and administrative expenses line item are salaries wages and benefits travel sales commissions professional fees and depreciation and amortization utilities and rent for administrative facilities

 

research development and engineering expenses 

 

for the year ended december 31 2013 research development and engineering expenses decreased by 59 million when compared to the same period last year driven by declines in our display technologies and environmental technologies segments of 19 million and 11 million respectively in addition the allocation of the gain on the trueup of our 2012 pension plan valuation to research development and engineering expense partially drove the decline we continue to focus on new product development in areas such as wireless solutions and fiber to the cell site in our optical communications segment glass substrates for high performance displays in our display technologies segment and diesel filters and substrates in the environmental technologies segment as a percentage of net sales research development and engineering expenses declined slightly in the year ended december 31 2013 when compared to the same period in 2012

 

 



research development and engineering expenses increased by 15 in 2012 when compared to 2011 and increased 2 as a percentage of net sales during 2012 corning’s research development and engineering focused on new product development as well as adjacent glass opportunities which leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes we believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies

 

restructuring impairment and other charges and credits 

 

corning recorded restructuring impairment and other charges and credits in 2013 2012 and 2011 which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented additional information on restructuring and asset impairment is found in note 2 restructuring impairment and other charges note 9 property net of accumulated depreciation and note 16 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements a description of those charges and credits follows

 

2013 activity 

 

to better align our 2014 cost position in several of our businesses corning implemented a global restructuring plan within several of our segments in the fourth quarter of 2013 consisting of workforce reductions asset disposals and writeoffs and exit costs we recorded charges of 67 million before tax associated with these actions with total cash expenditures expected to be approximately 40 million annualized savings from these actions are estimated to be approximately 40 million and will be reflected largely in selling general and administrative expenses

 

2012 activity 

 

in response to uncertain global economic conditions and the potential for slower growth in many of our businesses in 2013 corning implemented a corporatewide restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded charges of 89 million before tax which included costs for workforce reductions asset writeoffs and exit costs total cash expenditures associated with these actions were approximately 49 million and spending for employeerelated costs was completed in 2013 annualized savings from these actions are estimated to be approximately 71 million and will be reflected largely in selling general and administrative expenses

 

the specialty materials segment recorded an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2011 in the amount of 130 million before tax related to certain assets used in the production of large cover glass due to sales that were significantly below our expectations in the fourth quarter of 2012 after reassessing the large cover glass business corning concluded that the large cover glass market was developing differently in 2012 than our expectations demand for largersized cover glass was declining and the market for this type of glass was instead targeting smaller gen size products additionally in the fourth quarter of 2012 our primary customer of large cover glass notified corning of its decision to exit from this display market based on these events we recorded an additional impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the amount of 44 million before tax this impairment charge represents a writedown of assets specific to the glassstrengthening process for large size cover glass to their fair market values and includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process

 

2011 activity 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 the specialty materials segment recorded an impairment charge in the amount of 130 million related to certain assets located in japan used in the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass large cover glass is primarily used as a cover sheet of strengthened glass for frameless bezelless lcd displays the large cover glass impairment charge represents a writedown of assets specific to the glassstrengthening process for large size cover glass to their relative fair market values as of the date of impairment this asset group includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process and facilities dedicated to the ion exchange process

 

asbestos litigation 

 

in 2013 we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of 19 million compared to an increase of 14 million in 2012 and 24 million in 2011

 

our asbestos litigation liability was estimated to be 690 million at december 31 2013 compared with an estimate of 671 million at december 31 2012 the entire obligation is classified as a noncurrent liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than 12 months after the proposed amended pcc plan is ultimately effective and a portion of the obligation will be fulfilled through the direct contribution of corning’s investment in pce currently recorded as a noncurrent other equity method investment

equity in earnings of affiliated companies 

 

the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies in millions

 

  

equity earnings of affiliated companies decreased in the year ended december 31 2013 when compared to the same period last year driven by significantly lower earnings at samsung corning precision materials offset somewhat by higher equity earnings from dow corning the decline in equity earnings of samsung corning precision materials was driven by the following items

 

  

the change in equity earnings from samsung corning precision materials is also included in the discussion of core performance measures the performance of the display technologies segment and in all other

 

the following table provides a summary of equity earnings from dow corning by component in millions

 

  

beginning in the latter half of 2011 and continuing into 2012 dow corning began experiencing unfavorable industry conditions at its consolidated subsidiary hemlock a producer of high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries driven by overcapacity at all levels of the solar industry supply chain this overcapacity led to significant declines in polycrystalline spot prices in the fourth quarter of 2011 and prices remained depressed throughout 2012 in 2013 markets stabilized but prices remain significantly below historical levels

 

due to the conditions and uncertainties during 2012 described above sales volume declined and production levels of certain operating assets were reduced as a result in the fourth quarter of 2012 dow corning determined that a polycrystalline silicon plant expansion previously delayed since the fourth quarter of 2011 would no longer be economically viable and made the decision to abandon this expansion activity the abandonment resulted in an impairment charge of 57 million before tax for corning’s share of the write down in the value of these constructioninprogress assets further the startup of another polycrystalline silicon plant expansion that was expected to begin production in 2013 was delayed and the assets remain idled production will only commence when sales volumes increase to levels necessary to support the plant’s capacity the timing for startup of this expansion is uncertain and future adverse conditions may cause dow corning to reevaluate the longterm viability of the idled assets

 

 



additionally during the fourth quarter of 2012 the negative events and circumstances at dow corning indicated that assets of dow corning’s polycrystalline silicon business might be impaired in accordance with accounting guidance for impairment of longlived assets dow corning compared estimated undiscounted cash flows to the assets’ carrying value and determined that the asset group was recoverable as of december 31 2012 upon receiving the preliminary determination notices from the chinese ministry of commerce “mofcom” in the third quarter of 2013 dow corning again evaluated whether the polycrystalline silicon assets might be impaired the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows continued to indicate the assets were expected to be recovered however it is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted cash flows may change in the near term resulting in the need to write down those assets to fair value dow corning’s estimate of cash flows might change as a result of continued pricing deterioration ongoing oversupply in the market or other adverse market conditions that result in nonperformance by customers under longterm contracts corning’s share of the carrying value of this asset group is approximately 10 billion

 

in july 2012 the mofcom initiated antidumping and countervailing duty investigations of imports of solargrade polycrystalline silicon products from the us and korea based on a petition filed by chinese solargrade polycrystalline silicon producers the petition alleges that producers within these countries exported solargrade polycrystalline silicon to china at less than fair value and that production of solargrade polycrystalline silicon in the us has been subsidized by the us government on july 18 2013 mofcom announced its preliminary determination that china’s solargrade polycrystalline silicon industry suffered material damage because of dumping by producers in the us and korea the chinese authorities imposed provisional antidumping duties on producers in the us and korea ranging from 24 to 570 including duties of 533 on future imports of solargrade polycrystalline silicon product from the dow corning subsidiary into china on september 16 2013 the chinese authorities imposed provisional countervailing duties of 65 on january 20 2014 mofcom issued a final determination the final determination resulted in no change to the antidumping duties and the countervailing duties were reduced to 21 the requirement for customers to pay provisional duties on imports from solargrade polycrystalline silicon producers became effective on july 24 2013 for the antidumping duties and on september 20 2013 for the countervailing duties adjusted for the final determination dow corning will not be subject to duties for previous sales and is evaluating possible actions in response to the final determination

 

equity earnings from dow corning increased by 118 in the twelve months ended december 31 2013 when compared to the same period in 2012 due to the following items

 

  

equity earnings from dow corning were negatively impacted by the following items in the twelve months ended december 31 2012 when compared to the same period in 2011

 

  

the decrease in equity earnings from dow corning in 2012 was offset somewhat by the following items

 

  

 



other income net 

 

“other income net” in corning’s consolidated statements of income includes the following in millions

 

  

royalty income from samsung corning precision materials decreased in 2013 when compared to 2012 reflecting the decline in their sales volume in 2012 royalty income was significantly lower when compared to 2011 due to the reduction of the applicable royalty rate by approximately 50 beginning in december 2011

 

included in the line item foreign currency transaction and hedge gains losses net for the year ended december 31 2013 is the impact of the purchased collars and average rate forward contracts which were entered into in 2013 to hedge our exposure to movements in the japanese yen and its impact on our net earnings we recorded a net gain relating to the changes in the fair value of these contracts offset slightly by the premium expense in the amount of 435 million in the year ended december 31 2013

 

income before income taxes 

 

the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on income before income taxes in the year ended december 31 2013 was not significant

 

provision for income taxes 

 

our provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows dollars in millions

 

  

  

the effective income tax rate for 2013 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items

 

  

partially offsetting the benefits above is a 48 million charge attributable to a change in the judgment regarding the realizability of certain foreign and state deferred tax assets

 

the effective income tax rate for 2012 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items

 

  

 



corning has valuation allowances on certain shorterlived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss carry forwards and state tax net operating loss carry forwards as well as other foreign net operating loss carry forwards and federal and state tax credits because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire the amount of us and foreign deferred tax assets that had valuation allowances at december 31 2013 and 2012 was 286 million and 210 million respectively

 

corning continues to indefinitely reinvest substantially all of its foreign earnings with the exception in 2013 of approximately 12 million of earnings that had very low or no tax cost associated with their repatriation our current analysis indicates that we have sufficient us liquidity including borrowing capacity to fund foreseeable us cash needs without requiring the repatriation of foreign cash one time or unusual items that may impact our ability or intent to keep our foreign earnings and cash indefinitely reinvested include significant us acquisitions stock repurchases shareholder dividends changes in tax laws or the development of tax planning ideas that allow us to repatriate earnings at little or no tax cost andor a change in our circumstances or economic conditions that negatively impact our ability to borrow or otherwise fund us needs from existing us sources as of december 31 2013 taxes have not been provided on approximately 124 billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings that are expected to remain invested indefinitely while it remains impracticable to calculate the tax cost of repatriating our total unremitted foreign earnings such cost could be material to the results of operations of corning in a particular period

 

our foreign subsidiary in taiwan operates under various tax holiday arrangements the nature and extent of such arrangements vary and the benefits of such arrangements phase out through 2018 the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 12 17 and 20 percentage points for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively

 

while we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next 12 months we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position

 

refer to note 6 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding income tax matters

 

net income attributable to corning incorporated 

 

as a result of the items discussed above net income and per share data was as follows in millions except per share amounts

 

  

core performance measures 

 

in managing the company and assessing our financial performance we supplement certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements with measures adjusted to exclude certain items to arrive at core performance measures we believe reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions net sales equity in earnings of affiliated companies and net income are adjusted to exclude the impacts of changes in the japanese yen the impact of the purchased collars average forward contracts and other yenrelated transactions acquisitionrelated costs the results of the polysilicon business of our equity affiliate dow corning discrete tax items restructuring and restructuringrelated charges certain litigationrelated expenses pension marktomarket adjustments and other items which do not reflect ongoing operating results of the company or our equity affiliates management discussion and analysis on our reportable segments has also been adjusted for these items as appropriate these measures are not prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we believe investors should consider these nongaap measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends these measures are not and should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap reporting measures for a reconciliation of nongaap performance measures and a further discussion of the measures please see “reconciliation of nongaap measures” below

core net sales 

 

for the year ended december 31 2013 core net sales increased by 5 when compared to the same period in 2012 higher sales in the display technologies optical communications and life sciences segments were offset slightly by declines in the environmental technologies and specialty materials segments in the display technologies segment volume increases in the midtwenties in percentage terms more than offset price declines in the midteens which drove an increase in sales of 173 million or 7 optical communications sales increased by 196 million driven by an increase in sales of our carrier products in the amount of 163 million largely due to the rampup of the fibertothepremises initiative in australia which increased by 28 million an increase of 23 million in sales of wireless products and higher sales of cable products in north america china and europe up 52 million 33 million and 26 million respectively net sales increased in the life sciences segment by 194 million driven by the impact of the acquisition of the discovery labware business in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the environmental technologies segment while automotive product sales remained relatively consistent with the prior year sales of our diesel products declined by 9 net sales declined by 176 million in the specialty materials segment due to a 17 decline in corning gorilla glass sales

 

core net sales in 2012 increased slightly when compared to the prior year due to sales growth in the specialty materials optical communications and life sciences segments offset almost entirely by a decrease in sales in our display technologies segment due to price declines in the midtwenties in percentage terms sales in the specialty materials segment increased by 25 due to a 315 million increase in sales of corning gorilla glass that is used as cover glass in portable handheld display devices tablets and notebook computers optical communications segment sales increased primarily due to sales growth in wireless and fibertothepremises products the increase in sales in our life sciences segment was driven by the acquisition of the discovery labware business in the fourth quarter of 2012 and by the small acquisition we completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 which produces highquality cell culture media

 

core equity in earnings of affiliated companies 

 

the following provides a summary of equity in earnings of associated companies excluding the impact of changes in the japanese yen and the results of dow corning’s consolidated subsidiary hemlock semiconductor dollars in millions

 

  

core equity earnings of affiliated companies declined by 17 in the year ended december 31 2013 when compared to the same period in 2012 equity earnings from samsung corning precision materials decreased by 130 million or 24 driven primarily by price declines in the midteens in percentage terms and higher taxes due to the expiration of tax holidays in the amount of 54 million slightly offsetting the decline were manufacturing improvements in the amount of 28 million core equity earnings from dow corning were relatively consistent in the twelve months ended december 31 2013 when compared to the same period in 2012 with lower prices and weaker demand for silicone products in europe and china and higher interest expense offset by a reduction in costs as a result of restructuring actions implemented in the fourth quarter of 2012

 

 



core equity earnings of affiliated companies declined by 35 in the year ended december 31 2012 when compared to the same period in 2011 at samsung corning precision materials the decrease in core equity earnings reflected substantial price declines in the midtwenties in percentage terms relatively consistent volume and share loss at a key customer at dow corning core equity earnings also declined driven by significant declines in silicone and polycrystalline silicon prices higher operating expenses due to an increase in pension expense severance expense and compensation accruals and the unfavorable impact from movements in foreign exchange rates offset slightly by an increase in volume for silicone products and lower interest expense

 

core earnings 

 

when compared to the same period last year core earnings increased in the twelve months ended december 31 2013 by 202 million or 13 driven by the following items

reconciliation of nongaap measures 

 

we utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with gaap to assess our financial and operating performance a nongaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that i excludes amounts or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income or statement of cash flows or ii includes amounts or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented

 

core net sales core equity earnings of affiliated companies and core earnings are nongaap financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the company’s operations

 

 



the following tables reconcile our nongaap financial measures to their most directly comparable gaap financial measure

 

  

  

  

 



  

  

items which we exclude from gaap measures to arrive at core performance measures are as follows

 

  

 



reportable segments 

 

our reportable segments are as follows

 

  

all other reportable segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “all other” this group is primarily comprised of development projects and results for new product lines

 

we prepared the financial results for our segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions we included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment’s net income we have allocated certain common expenses among our reportable segments differently than we would for standalone financial information segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements

2013 vs 2012 

 

in 2013 our display technologies segment regained positive momentum as demonstrated by the increase in core net sales of 7 when compared to core net sales in 2012 which declined by 7 when compared to 2011 during 2013 volume improvements in the midtwenties in percentage terms more than outpaced price declines in the midteens the increase in volume was driven by higher sales of largersized lcd televisions defined as greater than 40 inches which increased by nearly 100 in 2013 and higher sales in mobile computing products including tablets and smart phones additionally during the fourth quarter of 2013 we renewed the agreements with key customers that we had announced in the fourth quarter of 2012 which stabilize corning’s share at each of the customers and maintain a fixed relationship between corning’s pricing and competitive pricing at that customer

 

when compared to 2012 the decrease in core equity earnings from samsung corning precision materials in 2013 reflected relatively consistent volume and price declines in the midteens in percentage terms manufacturing improvements in the amount of 28 million were more than offset by higher taxes in the amount of 54 million driven by the partial expiration of a korean tax holiday

 

when compared to 2012 the increase in core net income in the display technologies segment in 2013 reflects an increase in volume in the midtwenties in percentage terms and the impact of cost reduction programs partially offset by price declines in the midteens in percentage terms and the impact of lower equity earnings

 

 



2012 vs 2011 

 

the decrease in core net sales in 2012 when compared to 2011 reflects price declines in the midtwenties in percentage terms which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 for the six month period driven by customer and competitive pressures associated with share shifts at several major customers in a period of excess glass supply sequential price declines became much more moderate in the second and third quarters of 2012 reflecting a better matching of supply and demand for glass and more stable levels of inventory in the lcd supply chain in the third and fourth quarter of 2012 corning entered into new supply agreements with key customers these agreements were intended to stabilize corning’s share at each of the customers and maintain a fixed relationship between corning’s pricing and competitive pricing for such customer fourth quarter sequential prices declined in the midsingle digit percentage slightly higher than the prior two quarters due to some initial adjustments to line up corning’s prior pricing with the requirements of these new agreements retail demand for largersized lcd televisions drove an increase in volume in the lowtwenties in percentage terms in our whollyowned business in 2012 when compared to the prior year and slightly offset the price declines described above movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales of this segment

 

the decrease in core equity earnings from our display technologies equity affiliates in 2012 when compared to 2011 reflected substantial price declines in the midtwenties in percentage terms driven by the circumstances described above relatively consistent volume and share loss at a key customer

 

when compared to 2011 the decrease in core net income in 2012 reflects the impact of price declines described above at both our whollyowned business and the segment’s equity affiliates and a reduction in royalty income partially offset by an increase in volume in the lowtwenties in percentage terms at our whollyowned business

 

a number of corning’s patents and knowhow are licensed to samsung corning precision materials as well as to third parties which generates royalty income royalty income from samsung corning precision materials decreased significantly in 2012 when compared to 2011 reflecting a decrease in the applicable royalty rate coupled with a decline in sales volume at samsung corning precision materials in december 2011 the applicable royalty rate was reduced for a fiveyear period by approximately 50 compared to the prior five years refer to note 7 investments to the consolidated financial statements for more information about related party transactions

 

other information 

 

the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan china and taiwan in 2013 four customers of the display technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for a combined 94 of total segment sales in 2012 three customers of the display technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for a combined 63 of total segment sales for 2011 four customers of the display technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for 77 of total segment sales our customers face the same global economic dynamics as we do in this market our nearterm sales and profitability would be impacted if any of these significant customers were unable to continue to purchase our products

 

in addition samsung corning precision materials’ sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers in 2013 2012 and 2011 sales to two lcd panel makers located in korea accounted for approximately 93 of samsung corning precision materials sales in each of those three years

 

corning has invested heavily to expand capacity to meet the projected demand for lcd glass substrates in 2013 2012 and 2011 capital spending in this segment was approximately 350 million 850 million and 13 billion respectively we expect capital spending for 2014 to be approximately 600 million

 

outlook 

 

corning anticipates another year of growth in the lcd glass market in 2014 with retail demand up midtohigh single digits in percentage terms as measured in square feet we believe that supply chain inventory levels remain healthy and industry glass supply appears aligned with overall demand

 

in the first quarter of 2014 corning anticipates that glass volume in its display technologies segment will be down slightly sequentially in line with normal seasonality the company expects lcd glass price declines to be higher than previous quarters the price declines are not related to the scp acquisition or a result of recent supply contract renewals the company expects that price declines will return to moderate levels after the first quarter

 

 



the end market demand for lcd televisions monitors and notebooks is dependent on consumer retail spending among other things we are cautious about the potential negative impacts that economic conditions particularly a global economic recession excess market capacity and world political tensions could have on consumer demand while the industry has grown rapidly in recent years economic volatility along with consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes prices or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth therefore it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time we may incur further charges in this segment to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity

 

optical communications

 

  

   

the following table reconciles the nongaap financial measures for the optical communications segment with our financial statements presented in accordance with gaap in millions see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations – core performance measures “items which we exclude from gaap measures to arrive at core performance measures” for an explanation of the reconciling items

 

  

 



2013 vs 2012 

 

in 2013 core net sales of the optical communications segment increased when compared to 2012 driven by an increase of 163 million in the carrier network market driving the growth in carrier network products are the following items

 

  

sales in the enterprise network market increased by 33 million in the year ended 2013 when compared to 2012 driven by higher sales of data center products in north america

 

the increase in core net income in 2013 when compared to 2012 reflects an increase in volume in carrier and enterprise network products improved manufacturing performance and the implementation of strong spending controls and cost reduction initiatives offset by lower volume in optical fiber lower price and a less favorable mix of products sales in 2013 movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the results of this segment

 

the optical communications segment has a concentrated customer base in the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 one customer which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for 10 12 and 12 respectively of total segment net sales

 

2012 vs 2011 

 

core net sales for the segment were up slightly when compared to 2011 due to increased demand for our carrier network products driven by an increase in optical fiber and cable in china in the amount of 82 million an increase of 42 million for fibertothepremises products in australia and an increase in wireless products of 26 million this growth was offset somewhat by a decline in sales of 28 million for legacy copper products the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on net sales of this segment was not significant approximately 1

 

the decrease in core net income in 2012 reflects the impact of lower sales of premium fiber products an increase in research and development expenses and an increase in project spending somewhat offsetting the decrease in core net income was the partial reversal of a warranty reserve related to our fibertothepremises and fiber optic cable products in the pretax amount of 10 million recorded in the third quarter of 2012 movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact core net income of this segment

 

outlook 

 

we anticipate sales growth to be in the midteens in percentage terms in the optical communications segment in the first quarter of 2014 when compared to the same period last year

 

changes in our customers’ expected deployment plans or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fibertothepremises products could also affect sales levels should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated our sales and earnings would be adversely affected

 

 



environmental technologies 

 

  

   

the following table reconciles the nongaap financial measures for the environmental technologies segment with our financial statements presented in accordance with gaap in millions see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations – core performance measures “items which we exclude from gaap measures to arrive at core performance measures” for an explanation of the reconciling items

 

  

2013 vs 2012 

 

when compared to 2012 core net sales in the environmental technologies segment decreased in 2013 due to lower sales of light duty diesel filters and heavy duty diesel products demand for light duty diesel vehicles which use our filters declined due to weak economic conditions in europe heavy duty diesel product sales were lower due to the decline in the production of class 8 vehicles in north america net sales of this segment in 2013 were not materially impacted by movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2012

 

although core net sales declined in 2013 when compared to 2012 core net income increased by 9 driven by significantly improved manufacturing performance for our automotive and heavy duty diesel products and lower operating expenses movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the results of this segment in the year ended december 31 2013

 

 



the environmental technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of catalyzer and emission control systems manufacturers who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers the use of our substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel vehicle or engine manufacturers for 2013 2012 and 2011 net sales to three customers which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment sales accounted for 87 86 and 85 respectively of total segment sales while we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues with our direct customers our nearterm sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products

 

2012 vs 2011 

 

core net sales of this segment decreased in 2012 when compared to 2011 due to a decline in net sales of our diesel products the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on net sales of this segment was not significant approximately 3 although sales of light duty diesel products decreased due to a decline in demand for vehicles in europe requiring light duty diesel filters sales of our heavy duty diesel products increased 8 in 2012 partially offsetting the decrease in light duty diesel sales during the latter half of 2012 however the rate of growth of heavy duty products declined driven by a slowing of class 8 truck orders in north america sales of our automotive products increased in 2012 when compared to 2011 on continued growth in worldwide automotive production led by growth in north america

 

core net income in 2012 decreased slightly driven by a decrease in sales of light duty diesel products offset somewhat by an increase in heavy duty diesel volume improved manufacturing performance and a decrease in air freight costs when compared to the same period last year movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of core net income for the periods presented

 

outlook 

 

we anticipate that sales in the first quarter of 2014 will increase by midsingle digits in percentage terms when compared to the first quarter of 2013 driven by improvements in heavyduty diesel products in china and europe

 

specialty materials 

 

  

   

 



the following table reconciles the nongaap financial measures for the specialty materials segment with our financial statements presented in accordance with gaap in millions see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations – core performance measures “items which we exclude from gaap measures to arrive at core performance measures” for an explanation of the reconciling items

 

  

2013 vs 2012 

 

the specialty materials segment manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs consequently this segment operates in a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets that include display optics and components semiconductor optics components aerospace and defense astronomy ophthalmic products telecommunications components and a protective cover glass that is optimized for portable display devices and televisions

 

core net sales for the year ended december 31 2013 decreased in the specialty materials segment when compared to 2012 due to a 17 decline in sales of corning gorilla glass although retail demand for products using our corning gorilla glass has increased in 2013 supply chain variability during which we experienced robust sales of this glass in the latter half of 2012 resulted in a supply chain contraction throughout 2013 advanced optics products sales increased slightly in the year ended december 31 2013 driven by the beginning of a business recovery movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact core net sales of this reportable segment in the twelve months ended december 31 2013

 

although core net sales declined by 13 in the year ended december 31 2013 core net income decreased by only 2 when compared to 2012 due to strong cost controls manufacturing cost reduction initiatives and the beginning of the advanced optics products business recovery which partially offset the lower sales of corning gorilla glass core net income for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 was not significantly impacted from movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the same period in 2012

 

for 2013 three customers of the specialty materials segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment sales accounted for 47 of total segment sales for 2012 two customers of the specialty materials segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment sales accounted for 54 of total segment sales for 2011 two customers of the specialty materials segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment sales accounted for 42 of total segment sales

 

2012 vs 2011 

 

core net sales in 2012 increased in the specialty materials segment when compared to the same period in 2011 driven by a significant increase in sales volume of corning gorilla glass sales of corning gorilla glass have continued to increase due to a combination of strong retail demand for handheld display devices tablets and notebook computers and an increase in usage of our glass on these devices moderate price declines for corning gorilla glass and lower sales of our advanced optics products partially offset the increase in net sales movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales of this reportable segment in 2012

 

when compared to the same period last year the increase in core net income in 2012 was driven by the increase in sales of corning gorilla glass combined with increased manufacturing efficiency and the absence of large cover glass startup and tank conversion costs incurred in 2011 net income was not significantly impacted from movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the same period in 2011

 

 



outlook 

 

in the first quarter of 2014 we expect sales to decline in the midsingle digits in percentage terms when compared to the same period last year in 2014 the company expects its gorilla glass volume to increase when compared to 2013 and to be more in line with overall industry consumption of glass for devices

 

life sciences 

 

  

   

the following table reconciles the nongaap financial measures for the life sciences segment with our financial statements presented in accordance with gaap in millions see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations – core performance measures “items which we exclude from gaap measures to arrive at core performance measures” for an explanation of the reconciling items

 

  

2013 vs 2012 

 

core net sales for the year ended december 31 2013 increased when compared to the same period last year due to the impact of the acquisition of the discovery labware business completed in the fourth quarter of 2012 which increased net sales by 192 million net sales of the segment’s existing lines remained relatively consistent net sales in the year ended december 31 2013 were not significantly impacted by movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the same periods last year

 

when compared to the same period in 2012 core net income in the year ended december 31 2013 increased substantially driven by the impact of the discovery labware acquisition in the amount of 38 million movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the results of this segment in the year ended december 31 2013

 

for 2013 2012 and 2011 two customers in the life sciences segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of total segment net sales collectively accounted for 44 38 and 39 respectively of total segment sales

 

 



2012 vs 2011 

 

core net sales in 2012 increased due to the impact of the acquisition of the majority of the discovery labware business which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2012 and a small acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 as well as a slight increase in the segment’s existing product lines the acquisitions support the company’s strategy to expand corning’s portfolio of life sciences products and enhance global customer access in this business and accounted for 65 million of the increase in sales in 2012 when compared to 2011 the negative impact of foreign exchange rate movements partially offset the increase in sales

 

the decrease in core net income in 2012 reflects the impact of higher raw materials costs and operating expenses in the amount of 22 million related to the acquisition of a majority of the discovery labware business which more than offset the favorable impact of the increase in net sales core net income in 2012 was not significantly impacted by movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the same period in 2011

 

outlook 

 

sales in the life sciences segment are expected to remain relatively consistent in the first quarter of 2014 when compared to the same period in 2013

 

all other 

 

  

   

the following table reconciles the nongaap financial measures for the all other segment with our financial statements presented in accordance with gaap in millions see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations – core performance measures “items which we exclude from gaap measures to arrive at core performance measures” for an explanation of the reconciling items

 

  

 



all other includes all other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting this group is primarily comprised of development projects that involve the use of various technologies for new products such as advanced flow reactors thinfilm photovoltaics and adjacency businesses in pursuit of thin strong glass this segment also includes results for certain corporate investments such as samsung corning precision materials’ nonlcd glass businesses eurokera and keraglass equity affiliates which manufacture smooth cooktop glassceramic products and corsam technologies llc corsam an equity affiliate established between corning and samsung corning precision materials to provide glass technology research refer to note 7 investments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about samsung corning precision materials and related party transactions

 

2013 vs 2012 

 

the increase in segment net loss in 2013 when compared to 2012 was driven by the writedown of assets to their fair value in the amount of 36 million in samsung corning precision materials’ nonlcd glass business the absence of the 2012 gain on the sale of assets in samsung corning precision materials’ nonlcd glass business and restructuring costs of 5 million associated with our global restructuring program implemented in the fourth quarter of 2013 partially offset by lower research development and engineering expenses on development projects the increase in core net loss in 2013 reflects the absence of the 2012 gain on the sale of assets in samsung corning precision materials’ nonlcd glass business and a decline in research development and engineering expenses for development projects

 

2012 vs 2011 

 

the results of this segment for the year ended 2012 when compared to the same period last year reflect an increase in research development and engineering expenses for development projects offset by a gain on the sale of assets in samsung corning precision materials’ nonlcd glass business

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

financing and capital structure 

 

the following items impacted corning’s financing and capital structure during 2013 and 2012

 

 

  

 



 

  

  

on april 24 2013 corning’s board of directors declared an 11 increase in the company’s quarterly common stock dividend corning’s quarterly dividend increased from 009 per share to 010 per share of common stock the board also authorized a stock repurchase program for purchasing up to 2 billion of the company’s common stock this program is incremental to repurchases totaling 15 billion completed in december 2012 the stock repurchase authorization expires on december 31 2014

 

on october 22 2013 corning’s board of directors authorized in conjunction with a series of strategic and financial agreements with samsung display an additional 2 billion share repurchase program through december 31 2015 effective upon the closing of the transaction the transaction closed on january 15 2014

 

capital spending 

 

capital spending was 1019 million in 2013 a decrease of 782 million when compared to 2012 in 2011 corning announced several multiyear investment plans to increase manufacturing capacity in several of our reportable segments specifically the projects focused on an lcd glass substrate facility in china for our display technologies segment and a capacity expansion project for specialty materials’ corning gorilla glass in japan although spending for these projects continued into 2013 the majority of the construction costs were incurred in 2012 and 2011 resulting in a significant decrease in capital spending in those segments in 2013 we expect our 2014 capital expenditures to be approximately 15 billion approximately 600 million will be allocated to our display technologies segment

 

cash flows 

 

summary of cash flow data in millions

 

  

2013 vs 2012 

 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased in the year ended december 31 2013 when compared to the same period last year largely due to a decrease in dividends received from affiliated companies and the unfavorable impact of changes in working capital driven by higher incentive compensation payments an increase in foreign tax payments and an increase in fiber inventory in the optical communications segment

 

net cash used in investing activities declined in 2013 when compared to 2012 due to a decrease in capital spending lower business acquisition spending and the liquidation of shortterm investments offset by the premium related to our purchased collars

 

net cash used in financing activities increased in 2013 when compared to the same period last year driven primarily by the absence of the issuance of longterm debt in the first quarter of 2012 higher share repurchases the retirement of longterm debt in the first quarter of 2013 and higher dividend payments

 

 



2012 vs 2011 

 

although 2012 net income declined when compared to 2011 operating cash flow remained relatively consistent the decrease in net income resulted primarily from the noncash impacts of significantly lower equity earnings and the absence of the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates experienced in 2011 the cash impact of higher dividends and a net positive change in working capital also effected operating cash flow

 

net cash used in investing activities increased in 2012 when compared to 2011 due to the acquisition of the majority of the discovery labware business from becton dickinson and company an investment in an affiliated company and lower cash received from shortterm investment liquidations offset slightly by a decrease in capital spending

 

net cash used in financing activities decreased in 2012 when compared to 2011 primarily due to the proceeds received from the issuance of longterm debt coupled with a decline in cash used for stock repurchases in 2012 somewhat offsetting the decrease in net cash used were the impacts of retiring longterm debt and a decline in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options

 

defined benefit pension plans 

 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees our largest single pension plan is corning’s us qualified plan at december 31 2013 this plan accounted for 78 of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation and 90 of the related plans’ assets

 

we have historically contributed to the us qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the irs minimum requirements in 2013 we did not contribute to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and contributed 5 million to our international pension plans in 2012 we made voluntary cash contributions of 75 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and 30 million to our international pension plans although we will not be subject to any mandatory contributions in 2014 we anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of up to 85 million to our us pension plan and up to 8 million to our international pension plans in 2014

 

in the first quarter of 2013 we elected to change our method of recognizing actuarial gains and losses for our defined benefit pension plans previously we recognized the actuarial gains and losses as a component of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis these amounts were amortized into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan to the extent such gains and losses were outside of the corridor where the corridor is equal to 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets at the beginning of the year in addition we used a calculated marketrelated value of plan assets for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets that spread asset gains and losses over a 3year period we have elected to recognize the change in the fair value of plan assets in full for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses outside of the corridor in pension costs annually in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever the plan is remeasured or valuation estimates are finalized the remaining components of pension expense are recorded on a quarterly basis while the historical policy of recognizing pension expense was considered acceptable we believe that the new policy is preferable as it recognizes the change in the fair value of plan assets in full for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets and eliminates the delay in recognition of net actuarial gains and losses outside of the corridor we have applied these changes retrospectively adjusting all prior periods as if the new accounting methodology was in effect during those periods

 

refer to note 13 employee retirement plans to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

 

restructuring 

 

to better align our 2014 cost position in several of our businesses corning implemented a global restructuring plan within several of our segments in the fourth quarter of 2013 consisting of workforce reductions asset disposals and writeoffs and exit costs we recorded charges of 67 million associated with these actions with total cash expenditures expected to be approximately 40 million annualized savings from these actions are estimated to be approximately 40 million and will be reflected largely in selling general and administrative expenses

 

in 2012 we recorded a charge of 89 million associated with a corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2013 the charge included costs for workforce reductions asset disposals and writeoffs and exit costs total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately 49 million primarily related to termination benefits and were largely finalized in 2013

 

 



during 2013 2012 and 2011 we made payments of 35 million 15 million and 16 million respectively related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions refer to note 2 restructuring impairment and other charges to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

 

key balance sheet data 

 

balance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table dollars in millions

 

   

credit ratings 

 

as of february 13 2014 our credit ratings were as follows

 

  

management assessment of liquidity 

 

we ended the fourth quarter of 2013 with over 52 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments the company has adequate sources of liquidity and we are confident in our ability to generate cash to meet existing or reasonably likely future cash requirements our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted at december 31 2013 although approximately 69 of the consolidated amount was held outside of the us we have sufficient us liquidity including borrowing capacity to fund foreseeable us cash needs without requiring the repatriation of foreign cash we utilize a variety of tax effective financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed

 

from time to time we may issue debt the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes or to refinance certain debt maturities additionally to manage interest rate exposure the company from time to time enters into interest rate swap agreements in may 2013 in anticipation of issuing 750 million of new longterm fixed rate debt the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate the instruments were designated as cash flow hedges during the fourth quarter the interest rate swaps expired prior to the issuance of the anticipated debt the issuance of which had become “not reasonably possible” rather than “probable” in november 2013 corning issued a 250 million note with a maturity of 10 years as opposed to the contemplated issuance of 750 million of new longterm fixed rate debt as the planned issuance did not occur as anticipated we recorded a small gain in the fourth quarter of 2013 a portion of this gain is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss income on the consolidated balance sheet until such time as the hedged item impacts earnings

 

 



on june 24 2013 the company established a commercial paper program on a private placement basis pursuant to which we may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of 1 billion under this program the company may issue the notes from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes the maturities of the notes will vary but may not exceed 390 days from the date of issue the interest rates will vary based on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the notes by credit rating agencies at the time of issuance the company’s 1 billion revolving credit facility is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program if needed at december 31 2013 we did not have any outstanding commercial paper

 

on october 31 2013 as part of the previously authorized share repurchase program announced on april 24 2013 corning entered into an accelerated share repurchase “asr” agreement with jp morgan chase bank national association london branch “jpmc” under the asr corning agreed to purchase 1 billion of its common stock in total with an initial delivery by jpmc of 471 million shares based on the current market price and payment of 1 billion made by corning to jpmc the payment to jpmc was recorded as a reduction to shareholders’ equity consisting of an 800 million increase in treasury stock which reflects the value of the initial 471 million shares received upon execution and a 200 million decrease in otherpaidin capital which reflects the value of the stock held back by jpmc pending final settlement on january 28 2014 the asr was completed corning received an additional 105 million shares on january 31 2014 to settle the asr in total corning purchased 576 million shares based on the average daily volume weightedaverage price of corning’s common stock during the term of the asr less a discount

 

in addition to the ars during 2013 we repurchased 35 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately 500 million as part of the share repurchase program announced on april 24 2013 during 2012 and 2011 we repurchased 56 million and 55 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately 720 million and 780 million respectively as part of the share repurchase program announced on october 5 2011

 

we complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk we closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues we currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues

 

our major funding sources for 2013 and beyond will be our operating cash flow and our existing balances of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments proceeds from our commercial paper program financing transactions and any issuances of debt we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations share repurchase programs acquisitions the asbestos litigation research and development capital expenditures scheduled debt repayments and dividend payments

 

corning also has access to a 10 billion unsecured committed revolving credit facility the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes including support for our commercial paper program this credit facility includes a leverage ratio financial covenant the required leverage ratio which measures debt to total capital is a maximum of 50 at december 31 2013 our leverage using this measure was 134 and we are in compliance with the financial covenant

 

in the first quarter of 2013 corning repaid the aggregate principal amount and accrued interest outstanding on the credit facility entered into in the second quarter of 2011 that allowed corning to borrow up to chinese renminbi rmb 40 billion the total amount repaid was approximately 500 million upon repayment this facility was terminated

 

our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events in addition the majority of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision whereby a default on one debt obligation of the company in excess of a specified amount would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument as of december 31 2013 we were in compliance with all such provisions

 

management is not aware of any known trends demands commitments events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in our liquidity in addition other than items discussed there are no known material trends favorable or unfavorable in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources

 

 



purchased collars and average rate forwards 

 

in the first quarter of 2013 corning executed a series of purchased collars that expire quarterly across a twoyear period to hedge its translation exposure resulting from movements in the japanese yen against the us dollar these derivatives are not designated as accounting hedges and changes in fair value are recorded in other income immediately the fair value of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets gain position or liabilities loss position on the consolidated balance sheet

 

in the second quarter of 2013 corning entered into a series of average rate forwards with no associated premium which partially hedge the impact of japanese yen on corning’s projected 2015 net income like the purchased collars these contracts settle quarterly and are not designated as accounting hedges

 

in the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded a net gain of 435 million before tax related to changes in the fair value of the purchased collars and average rate forward contracts offset slightly by premium expense this gain is recorded in earnings in the other income net line of the consolidated statements of income

 

off balance sheet arrangements 

 

off balance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements

 

corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include the following

 

  

at the time a guarantee is issued the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant

 

refer to note 14 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

 

for variable interest entities we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of its expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests which are the ownership contractual or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests

 

corning has identified one entity that qualifies as a variable interest entity this entity is not considered to be significant to corning’s consolidated statements of position

 

corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit liquidity or market risk support to that entity

 

 



contractual obligations 

 

the amounts of our obligations follow in millions

 

  

  

we are required at the time a guarantee is issued to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant

 

in the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded a financing obligation in the approximate amount of 230 million for a new lcd glass substrate facility in china

 

we have agreed to provide up to a 25 million credit facility to dow corning the funding of the dow corning credit facility will be required only if dow corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed bankruptcy plan

 

we believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded

 

environment 

 

corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by the agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2013 and 2012 corning had accrued approximately 15 million undiscounted and 21 million undiscounted respectively for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote

 

 



critical accounting estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates that required us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates follow

 

impairment of assets held for use 

 

we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified we review our longlived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred

 

manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals primarily platinum and rhodium these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of longlived assets this review considers all of the company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process in reclamation fabrication or refinement in anticipation of reuse or awaiting use to support increased capacity precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other nonmanufacturing related purposes

 

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include

 

  

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for the majority of our reportable segments we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities

 

for longlived assets when impairment indicators are present we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used assessments also consider changes in asset utilization including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used

 

for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability described above the estimated fair value of longlived assets is determined using an “income approach” “market approach” “cost approach” or a combination of one or more of these approaches as appropriate for the particular asset group being reviewed all of these approaches start with the forecast of expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of longlived assets and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals if appropriate for the asset group being reviewed some of the more significant estimates and assumptions in our analysis include market size and growth market share projected selling prices manufacturing cost and discount rate our estimates are based upon our historical experience our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate

 

 





in the event the current net book value of an asset group is found to be greater than the net present value of the cash flows derived from the asset group we determine the actual fair market value of longlived assets with the assistance from valuation appraisals conducted by third parties the results of these valuations generally represent the fair market value of the asset group that will remain after any necessary impairment adjustments have been recorded the impairment charge will be allocated to assets within the asset group on a relative fair value basis

 

at december 31 2013 the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by 164 million at december 31 2012 the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair value by 28 million these precious metals are utilized by the display and specialty materials segments corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments the potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments such events include but are not limited to a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our display technologies or specialty materials segments

 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 the specialty materials segment recorded an impairment charge in the amount of 130 million related to certain assets used in the production of large cover glass due to sales that were significantly below our expectations in the fourth quarter of 2012 after reassessing the large cover glass business corning concluded that the large cover glass market was developing differently in 2012 than our expectations and demand for largersized cover glass was declining and the market for this type of glass was instead targeting smaller gen size products additionally in the fourth quarter of 2012 our primary customer of large cover glass notified corning of its decision to exit from this display market based on these events we recorded an additional impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the amount of 44 million before tax this impairment charge represents a writedown of assets specific to the glassstrengthening process for large size cover glass to their fair market values and includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process additional information on the asset impairment is found in note 2 restructuring impairment and other charges note 9 property net of accumulated depreciation and note 16 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements

 

impairment of goodwill 

 

we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units

 

corning’s goodwill relates primarily to the optical communications specialty materials and life sciences operating segments on a quarterly basis management performs a qualitative assessment of factors in each reporting unit to determine whether there have been any triggering events the twostep impairment test is required only if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount we perform a detailed twostep process every three years if no indicators suggest a test should be performed in the interim we use this calculation as quantitative validation of the stepzero qualitative process that is performed during the intervening periods and does not represent an election to perform the twostep process in place of the stepzero review

 

the following summarizes our qualitative process to assess our goodwill balances for impairment

 

   

the examples noted above are not allinclusive and the company shall consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test

 

 



our two step goodwill recoverability assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the longterm growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows our valuation method is an “income approach” using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return our estimates are based upon our historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends

 

optical communications 

 

goodwill for the optical communications segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level on a quarterly basis in 2013 management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the optical communications reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount

 

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2012 for this reporting unit the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount a discount rate of 9 was used in 2012 we determined a range of discount rates between 7 and 11 would not have affected our conclusion

 

specialty materials 

 

goodwill for the specialty materials segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is one level below an operating segment as goodwill is the result of transactions associated with certain businesses within this operating segment there is only one reporting unit with goodwill within this operating segment on a quarterly basis in 2013 management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the specialty materials reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount

 

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2012 for this reporting unit the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount a discount rate of 8 was used in 2012 we determined a range of discount rates between 6 and 10 would not have affected our conclusion additionally the asset impairment which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 did not cause a triggering event for goodwill impairment in this reporting unit because the cash flow related to this lower level asset group is not material to this reporting unit

 

life sciences 

 

goodwill for the life sciences segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level on a quarterly basis in 2013 management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the life sciences reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount

 

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2012 for this reporting unit the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount a discount rate of 7 was used in 2012 we determined a range of discount rates between 5 and 9 would not have affected our conclusion

 

restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions 

 

we are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including for example employee termination costs restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses of portions thereof their profitability cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome the judgment involved can be difficult subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses

 

restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which as a result require impairment we are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned

 

 





income taxes 

 

we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environments in which we do business it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances

 

corning accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb asc topic 740 income taxes as required under fasb asc topic 740 we record tax benefits only for technical positions that we believe have a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement in estimating these amounts we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue a particular position or alternatively consider a negotiated compromise and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position as a result it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates

 

equity method investments 

 

at december 31 2013 and 2012 the carrying value of our equity method investments was 55 billion and 49 billion respectively with our two largest equity method investments samsung corning precision materials and dow corning comprising approximately 93 of the balance we review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if an event or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be otherthantemporarily impaired when such indicators are present we then perform an indepth review for impairment an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability forecasted tax rates foreign currency exchange rate movements terminal value assumptions historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable

 

to extend corning’s leadership in specialty glass and drive earnings growth corning announced in october 2013 that it is entering into a series of strategic and financial agreements with samsung display which will result in corning obtaining full ownership of samsung corning precision materials as part of this agreement in the fourth quarter of 2013 corning acquired the minority interests of three shareholders in samsung corning precision materials for 506 million which includes payment for the transfer of nonoperating assets and the prorata portion of cash on samsung corning precision materials balance sheet at september 30 2013 the resulting transfer of shares to corning increased corning’s ownership percentage of samsung corning precision materials from 50 to 57 because this transaction did not result in a change in control based on the governing articles of this entity corning did not consolidate this entity as of december 31 2013 the remaining transactions were completed on january 15 2014 which increased corning’s ownership to 100 and will result in consolidation of the entity beginning in the first quarter of 2014 this organization will be integrated into corning’s display technologies segment refer to note 21 subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

 

fair value measures 

 

as required corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the company’s own market assumptions once inputs have been characterized we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement in addition observable market data must be used when available and the highestandbestuse measure should be applied to nonfinancial assets corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are shortterm and longterm investments certain pension asset investments and derivatives these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions

 

derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in arriving at the fair value of corning’s derivative assets and liabilities we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria including such factors as credit risk of the relevant

 

 



party to the transaction amounts related to credit risk are not material

 

the level 3 assets measured with unobservable inputs relate to certain pension asset investments and all longlived assets fair valued on a nonrecurring basis related to the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass in 2012 we recorded an impairment charge in the amount of 44 million related to these ion exchange assets used in the production of large cover glass refer to note 16 fair value measurements of the consolidated financial statements for further detail

 

probability of litigation outcomes 

 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter case law and other casespecific issues see part ii – item 3 legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face the most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability including the inherent complexity of a chapter 11 filing our history of success in defending asbestos claims our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses and our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants’ representatives the proposed asbestos resolution amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies the approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is not certain and faces objections by some parties any approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is subject to appeal for these and other reasons corning’s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters the estimate of the cost of resolving the nonpcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning’s financial statements is remote

 

other possible liabilities 

 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters including certain tax planning and environmental matters these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals

 

pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb 

 

pension and opeb costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates benefits earned interest cost expected return on plan assets mortality rates and other factors in the first quarter of 2013 we elected to change our method of recognizing actuarial gains and losses for our defined benefit pension plans previously we recognized the actuarial gains and losses as a component of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis these amounts were amortized into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan to the extent such gains and losses were outside of the corridor where the corridor is equal to 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets at the beginning of the year in addition we used a calculated marketrelated value of plan assets for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets that spread asset gains and losses over a 3year period we have elected to recognize the change in the fair value of plan assets in full for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses outside of the corridor in pension costs annually in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever the plan is remeasured or valuation estimates are finalized the remaining components of pension expense are recorded on a quarterly basis for our opeb plans actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s employee pension and other postretirement obligations and current and future expense

 

 





the following table presents our actual and expected return on assets as well as the corresponding percentage for the years ended 2013 2012 and 2011

 

  

  

as of december 31 2013 the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was 2844 million

 

the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans

 

  

the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning’s funding requirements

 

in addition at december 31 2013 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders’ equity by 107 million before tax and a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders’ equity by 103 million in addition the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate

 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to corning’s us opeb plans

 

  

  

the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear

 

revenue recognition 

 

the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned in certain instances revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns allowances discounts and other factors these estimates are supported by historical data while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning’s future results 

 

 





sharebased compensation 

 

sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates sharebased compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks tableend  

we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects

 

  

our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the japanese yen south korean won new taiwan dollar chinese renminbi and the euro we seek to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using overthecounter otc derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts typically with durations of 36 months or less in general these hedges expire coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions

 

we are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts however we minimize this risk by limiting the counterparties to a diverse group of highlyrated major international financial institutions with which we have other financial relationships we do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments

 

our cash flow hedging activities utilize otc foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers we also use otc foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes the undesignated hedges limit exposures to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies a significant portion of the company’s nonus revenues are denominated in japanese yen when these revenues are translated back to us dollars the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements in the japanese yen to protect translated earnings against movements in the japanese yen the company has entered into a series of purchased collars and average rate forwards with a purchased collar structure the company writes a local currency call option and purchases a local currency put option the purchased collars offset the impact of translated earnings above the put price and below the call strike price and that offset is reported in other income net

 

equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations equity in earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments were 547 million and 810 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively with foreignbased affiliates comprising over 63 of this amount in 2013 equity earnings from samsung corning precision materials totaled 320 million for 2013 and 699 million for 2012 exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies

 

we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2013 with respect to open foreign exchange forward and option contracts and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 479 million compared to 236 million at december 31 2012 specific to the japanese yen a 10 adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 398 million compared to 196 million at december 31 2012 specific to the euro a 10 adverse movement in quoted euro exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 31 million compared to 25 million at december 31 2012

 

as we derive approximately 69 of our net sales from outside the us our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies most notably the japanese yen and euro our forecasts generally assume exchange rates during 2014 remain constant at january 2014 levels as an example of the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our financial results we compare 2013 actual sales in yen and euro transaction currencies at an average currency exchange rate during the year to a 10 change in the currency exchange rate a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2013 net sales of approximately 265 million a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2013 net sales of approximately 103 million using 2013 net income attributable to corning incorporated as a percentage of net sales of 25 we can estimate that a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2013 net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately 220 million a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2013 net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately 14 million

 

 



interest rate risk management 

 

it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates we are party to two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of 550 million of previously issued fixed rate longterm debt to floating rate debt under the terms of the swap agreements we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the onemonth libor rate

 

in may 2013 in anticipation of issuing 750 million of new longterm fixed rate debt the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate the instruments were designated as cash flow hedges during the fourth quarter the interest rate swaps expired prior to the issuance of the anticipated debt the issuance of which had become “not reasonably possible” rather than “probable” in november 2013 corning issued a 250 million note with a maturity of 10 years as opposed to the contemplated issuance of 750 million of new longterm fixed rate debt as the planned issuance did not occur as anticipated we recorded a small gain in the fourth quarter of 2013 a portion of this gain is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss income on the consolidated balance sheet until such time as the hedged item impacts earnings

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends 

as a multinational global company we face many risks which could adversely impact our ongoing operations and reported financial results 

we operate in over 100 countries and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from and have significant operations outside of the united states our international operations include manufacturing assembly sales customer support and shared administrative service centers 

compliance with laws and regulations increases our cost of doing business these laws and regulations include us laws and local laws which include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations prohibitions on payments to governmental officials import and trade restrictions and export requirements noncompliance and violations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties 

we are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a multinational global organization including those related to 

• 

general economic conditions in each country or region 

• 

operations outside the us are subject to many complex regulatory requirements affecting international trade and investment including antidumping laws export controls the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the substance or enforcement of these regulatory requirements and by actual or alleged violations of them 

• 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates convertibility of currencies and restrictions involving the movement of funds between jurisdictions and countries 

• 

sovereign risks may adversely affect corning’s profitability and assets 

• 

geographical concentration of our factories and operations and regional shifts in our customer base 

• 

periodic health epidemic concerns 

• 

political unrest confiscation and expropriation of our assets by foreign governments terrorism and the potential for other hostilities 

• 

difficulty in protecting intellectual property or sensitive commercial and operations data or information technology systems generally 

• 

differing legal systems including protection and treatment of intellectual property and patents 

• 

complex tax regimes tariffs duties trade duties and other trade barriers including antidumping duties 

• 

difficulty in collecting obligations owed to us such as accounts receivable 

• 

natural disasters such as floods earthquakes and windstorms and 

• 

potential power loss or disruption affecting manufacturing 

our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or circumstances of one or more key customers leading to the substantial reduction in orders for our products 

in 2012 corning’s ten largest customers accounted for 50 of our sales 

in addition a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in our reportable segments for 2012 three customers of the display technologies segment accounted for 63 of total segment net sales when combined in the telecommunications segment one customer accounted for 12 of segment net sales in the environmental technologies segment three customers accounted for 86 of total segment sales in aggregate in the specialty materials segment two customers accounted for 54 of segment sales in 2012 in the life sciences segment two customers accounted for 38 of segment sales in 2012 as a result of mergers and consolidations between customers corning’s customer base could become more concentrated 

samsung corning precision materials’ sales were also concentrated in 2012 with sales to two lcd panel makers located in south korea accounting for approximately 93 of total samsung corning precision materials sales 

our telecommunications segment customers’ purchases of our products are affected by their capital expansion plans general market and economic uncertainty and regulatory changes including broadband policy sales in the telecommunications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of fibertothepremises deployments our sales will be dependent on planned targets for homes passed and connected changes in our customers’ deployment plans could adversely affect future sales in any quarter or for the full year 

in the environmental technologies segment sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for automotive and diesel emissions are expected to fluctuate with vehicle production changes in laws and regulations for air quality and emission controls may also influence future sales sales in our environmental technologies segment are mainly to three catalyzers and emission system control manufacturers our customers sell these systems to automobile and diesel engine original equipment manufacturers sales in this segment may be affected by adverse developments in the global vehicle or freight hauling industries or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicle sales or downturns in freight traffic 

certain sales in our specialty materials segment track worldwide economic cycles and our customers’ responses to those cycles in addition any positive trends in prior years in the sales of strengthened glass may not continue we may experience losses relating to our inability to supply contracted quantities of this glass and processes planned to produce new versions of this glass may not be successful 

sales in our life sciences segment are concentrated with two large distributors who are also competitors and the balance is to a variety of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies hospitals universities and other research facilities in 2012 our two largest distributors accounted for 38 of life sciences’ segment sales changes in our distribution arrangements in this segment may adversely affect this segment’s financial results

our operations and financial performance could be negatively impacted if the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies evolving industry or regulatory standards and new product introductions our success is dependent on the successful introduction of new products or upgrades of current products and our ability to compete with new technologies the following factors related to our products and markets if they do not continue as in the recent past could have an adverse impact on our operations 

• 

our ability to introduce leading products such as glass substrates for liquid crystal displays optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment and environmental substrate and filter products at competitive prices 

• 

our ability to manufacture glass substrates and strengthened glass to satisfy our customers technical requirements and our contractual obligations and 

• 

our ability to develop new products in response to government regulations and laws 

we face pricing pressures in each of our businesses that could adversely affect our financial performance 

we face pricing pressure in each of our businesses as a result of intense competition emerging technologies or overcapacity while we work consistently toward reducing our costs to offset pricing pressures we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or sustain our current rate of cost reduction we anticipate pricing pressures will continue in the future in all our businesses 

any of these items could cause our sales or profitability to be significantly reduced 

we face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations 

because we have significant customers and operations outside the us fluctuations in foreign currencies especially the japanese yen new taiwan dollar korean won and euro affect our sales net income and cash flow foreign exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies depreciate in value relative to the us dollar and japanese yen sales in our display technologies segment representing 36 of corning’s sales in 2012 are primarily denominated in japanese yen corning hedges significant transaction and balance sheet currency exposures and uses derivative instruments to limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities as well as operating results although we selectively hedge these items changes in exchange rates especially the japanese yen to us dollar will significantly impact our reported revenues and profits 

we have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with foreign currency exposures as a part of this program we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in the value of our foreign currency exposures are at least partially offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions a large portion of our consolidated operations are international and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures net of gains or losses from our hedging programs for example we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures or should we elect not to hedge certain of our foreign currency exposures our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors all of these factors could materially impact our results of operations anticipated future results financial position and cash flows the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control 

if the financial condition of our customers declines our credit risks could increase 

although we have a rigorous process to administer credit and believe our bad debt reserve is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable if our customers or our indirect customers fail to meet their payment obligations for our products we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amounts reserved many customers of our display technologies and specialty materials segments are thinly capitalized andor unprofitable in our environmental technologies segment the us auto makers and certain of their suppliers have encountered credit downgrades or have filed for bankruptcy protection in our telecommunications segment certain large infrastructure projects are subject to governmental funding which if terminated could adversely impact the financial strength of our customers these factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business 

the success of our business depends on our ability to develop and produce quality products that meet our customers’ needs 

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our customers oems and distributors this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to manage and maintain key customer relationships our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers the manufacturing of our products involves highly complex and precise processes in some cases existing manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the requirements of our customers we will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to maintain profitable operations while we continue to fund projects to improve our manufacturing techniques and processes and lower our costs we may not achieve satisfactory manufacturing costs that will fully enable us to meet our profitability targets 

in addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on our ability to innovate with respect to both products and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation failure to continue to deliver quality and competitive products to the marketplace to adequately protect our intellectual property rights to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our future financial performance depends on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials precious metals parts and manufacturing equipment to meet the demands of our customers 

our ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials precious metals parts and components from our suppliers we may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages there can be no assurances that we will not encounter problems in the future furthermore certain manufacturing equipment raw materials or components are available only from a single source or limited sources we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner a reduction interruption or delay of supply or a significant increase in the price for supplies such as manufacturing equipment precious metals raw materials or energy could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

we have incurred and may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 

at december 31 2012 corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of 1496 million while we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe or if acquisitions and investments made by the company fail to achieve expected returns

if our products including materials purchased from our suppliers experience performance issues our business will suffer 

our business depends on the production of products of consistently high quality our products components and materials purchased from our suppliers are typically tested for quality these testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios for various reasons our products including materials purchased from our suppliers may fail to perform as a customer expected in some cases product redesigns or additional expense may be required to address such issues a significant or systemic quality issue could result in customer relations problems lost sales reduced volumes product recalls and financial damages and penalties 

we operate in a highly competitive environment 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on the company’s share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace the company competes on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products thus our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or unexpected emerging technologies or products we expect that we will face continuous competition from existing competitors low cost manufacturers and new entrants we believe we must invest in research and development engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities and continue to improve customer service in order to remain competitive we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position 

we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses particularly lcd glass and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices if our competitors offer significant discounts on certain products or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to retain our customers and market positions any such changes may reduce our profitability and cash flow any broadbased change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as we implement and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies if we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand our revenues could decrease 

lcd glass generates a significant amount of the company’s profits and cash flow and any events that adversely affect the markets for lcd glass substrates could have a material and negative impact on results our financial results 

corning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the level of profitability of our lcd business as a result any event that adversely affects our display business could have a significant impact on results of our consolidated financial results these events could include loss of patent protection increased costs associated with manufacturing and increased competition from the introduction of new and more desirable products if any of these events had a material adverse effect on the sales of our lcd glass such an event could result in material charges and a significant reduction in profitability 

additionally emerging material technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications including display glass handheld cover glass and others resulting in a decline in demand for our products existing or new production capacity for glass substrates may exceed the demand for them technologies for displays handheld cover glass and other applications in competition with our glass may reduce or eliminate the need for our glass substrates new process technologies developed by our competitors may also place us at a cost or quality disadvantage our own process technologies may be acquired or used unlawfully by others enabling them to compete with us our inability to manufacture glass substrates to the specifications required by our customers may result in loss of revenue margins and profits or liabilities for failure to supply a scarcity of resources limitations on technology personnel or other factors resulting in a failure to produce commercial quantities of glass substrates could have adverse financial consequences to us 

changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors some of which are outside of our control including 

• 

changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates 

• 

changes in tax treaties and regulations and the interpretation of them 

• 

changes to our assessments about the realizability of our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environments in which we do business 

• 

the outcome of current and future tax audits examinations or administrative appeals 

• 

changes in generally accepted accounting principles that affect the accounting for taxes and 

• 

limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we earn a significant amount of our net profits from outside the us and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that could significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form proposed legislation may pass if enacted certain antideferral proposals could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow 

our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees 

the loss of the services of any of our key research and development engineering or operational personnel or senior management without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance 

we are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations 

various stages of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste waste water and other industrial waste and greenhouse gases and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of such substances we have installed antipollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities we have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations however we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps toward adopting more stringent environment standards 

corning incorporated – 2012 form 10k 9

back to contents 

any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us or the suspensioncessation of production or operations in addition environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the us and other countries such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and co2 abatement may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by among other things substantially increasing manufacturing costs limiting availability of scarce resources especially energy or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers 

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on patent and trade secret laws copyright trademark confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses we cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property worldwide may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of or the unauthorized use of our intellectual property litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently uncertain and the outcome is often unpredictable other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive 

the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products we periodically receive notices from or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights andor breach of our agreements with them these third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design manufacture or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us we cannot provide assurance as to the outcome of any such claims 

current or future litigation may harm our financial condition or results of operations 

as described in legal proceedings in this form 10k we are engaged in litigation and regulatory matters litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain and adverse rulings could occur resulting in significant liabilities penalties or damages such current or future substantial legal liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition cash flows and reputation 

we may not capture significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all 

developing our products through research and development is expensive and the investment often involves a long return on investment cycle we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by increases in our gross margin we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position 

business disruptions could affect our operating results 

a significant portion of our manufacturing research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas a major earthquake fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

additionally a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our display technologies segment is concentrated in three overseas countries and it is reasonably possible that the operations of one or more such facilities could be disrupted due to the specialized nature of the assets and the customers’ locations it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from facilities in other countries accordingly loss of these facilities could produce a nearterm severe impact on our display business and the company as a whole 

we face risks through equity affiliates that we do not control 

corning’s net income includes significant equity earnings from associated companies for the year ended december 31 2012 we recognized 810 million of equity earnings of which 97 came from our two largest investments dow corning which makes silicone and high purity polycrystalline products and samsung corning precision materials which primarily makes liquid crystal display glass samsung corning precision materials is located in the asiapacific region and is subject to political and geographic risks mentioned above as well as business and other risks within the display technologies segment our equity investments may not continue to perform at the same levels as in recent years dow corning emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2004 and has certain obligations under its plan of reorganization to resolve and fund claims of its creditors and personal injury claimants dow corning may incur further bankruptcy charges in the future which may adversely affect its operations or assets dow corning also could be adversely impacted by an unfavorable ruling by the chinese ministry of commerce mofcom and a continuation of significant price declines at their consolidated subsidiary hemlock semiconductor group in addition we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may adversely affect us 

we may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us 

we face the risk of loss resulting from product liability asbestos securities fiduciary liability intellectual property antitrust contractual warranty environmental fraud and other lawsuits whether or not such claims are valid in addition our product liability fiduciary directors and officers property policies including business interruption natural catastrophe and comprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect in the future a successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us to pay substantial sums some of the carriers in our historical primary and excess insurance programs are in liquidation and may not be able to respond if we should have claims reaching their policies the financial health of other insurers may deteriorate several of our insurance carriers are litigating with us the extent if any of their obligation to provide insurance coverage for asbestos liabilities asserted against us the results of that litigation may adversely affect our insurance coverage for those risks in addition we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain types of risk such as political risks terrorism or war 

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

corning incorporated – 2012 form 10k 10

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our continued operation and expansion outside the united states including in developing countries could increase the risk of such violations violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

moreover several of our equity affiliates and related partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws rules and business practices that differ from those in the united states although we strive to select equity partners and affiliates who share our values and understand our reporting requirements as a usdomiciled company and to ensure that an appropriate business culture exists within these ventures to minimize and mitigate our risk we nonetheless face the reputational and legal risk that our equity partners and affiliates may violate applicable laws rules and business practices 

acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business 

we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment or that we experience difficulty integrating new employees business systems and technology or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits such as increased revenue and cash flow enhanced efficiencies or market share or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized these events could harm our operating results or financial condition 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation 

we store and process personallyidentifiable information of our employees and in some cases our customers at the same time the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of the increasingly hostile information security environment this environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies despite these efforts it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

significant macroeconomic events changes in regulations or a crisis in the financial markets could limit our access to capital 

we utilize credit in both the capital markets and from banks to facilitate company borrowings hedging transactions leases and other financial transactions we maintain a 1 billion revolving credit agreement in the united states to fund with potential liquidity needs and to backstop certain transactions an adverse macroeconomic event or changes in bank regulations could limit our ability to gain access to credit or to renew the revolving credit agreement upon expiration additionally a financial markets crisis may limit our ability to utilize financial markets to access liquidity 

adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our cash investments 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various types of securities with varying maturities and credit quality these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that have affected global financial markets a significant part of our investment portfolio consists either directly or indirectly through the use of money market funds of us government securities if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline or if the us defaults on its debt obligations or its debt is downgraded our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely impact our financial results additionally these events could limit liquidity for redemption of our money market fund investments or losses if the money market funds experience a permanent loss 

information technology dependency and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue liability claims or competitive harm 

the company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure any significant breakdown intrusion interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we use electronic information technology it in our manufacturing processes and operations and other aspects of our business despite our implementation of security measures our it systems are vulnerable to disruptions from computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized access cyber attack and other similar disruptions a material breach in the security of our it systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets such disruptions or security breaches could result in the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business like other global companies we have from time to time experienced incidents related to our it systems and expect that such incidents will continue including malware and computer virus attacks unauthorized access systems failures and disruptions we have measures and defenses in place against unauthorized access but we may not be able to prevent immediately detect or remediate such events 

additionally utilities and other operators of critical energy infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks including cyber attacks in the event of such an attack disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power electrical gas etc 

international trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position 

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us including our equity affiliatesjoint ventures from being able to sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations these policies also affect our equity companies

 item 3 legal proceedings 

environmental litigation corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 17 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by the agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2012 and 2011 corning had accrued approximately 21 million undiscounted and 25 million undiscounted respectively for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 

dow corning corporation corning and the dow chemical company dow chemical each own 50 of the common stock of dow corning in may 1995 dow corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousands of breast implant product lawsuits on june 1 2004 dow corning emerged from chapter 11 with a plan of reorganization the plan which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims the plan also includes releases for corning and dow chemical as shareholders in exchange for contributions to the plan

on july 20 2012 the chinese ministry of commerce “mofcom” initiated antidumping and countervailing duty investigations of imports of solargrade polycrystalline silicon products from the us and korea based on a petition filed by chinese solargrade polycrystalline silicon producers the petition alleges that producers within these countries including a consolidated subsidiary of dow corning exported solargrade polycrystalline silicon to china at less than normal value and that production of solargrade polycrystalline silicon in the us has been subsidized by the us government if the chinese authorities rule that dumping or subsidization took place they may impose additional duties on future imports of solargrade polycrystalline silicon to china from the us dow corning and its consolidated subsidiaries are complying with mofcom in the investigations and are vigorously contesting the allegations as the outcome of such actions is uncertain dow corning cannot predict the ultimate impact of these matters 

pittsburgh corning corporation corning and ppg industries inc ppg each own 50 of the capital stock of pittsburgh corning corporation pcc over a period of more than two decades pcc and several other defendants have been named in numerous lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos on april 16 2000 pcc filed for chapter 11 reorganization in the us bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania at the time pcc filed for bankruptcy protection there were approximately 11800 claims pending against corning in state court lawsuits alleging various theories of liability based on exposure to pcc’s asbestos products and typically requesting monetary damages in excess of one million dollars per claim corning has defended those claims on the basis of the separate corporate status of pcc and the absence of any facts supporting claims of direct liability arising from pcc’s asbestos products corning is also currently involved in approximately 9800 other cases approximately 37500 claims alleging injuries from asbestos and similar amounts of monetary damages per case those cases have been covered by insurance without material impact to corning to date as of december 31 2012 corning had received for these cases approximately 186 million in insurance payments related to those claims as described below several of corning’s insurance carriers have filed a legal proceeding concerning the extent of any insurance coverage for past and future defense and indemnity costs for these claims asbestos litigation is inherently difficult and past trends in resolving these claims may not be indicators of future outcomes 

corning with other relevant parties has been involved in ongoing efforts to develop a plan of reorganization that would resolve the concerns and objections of the relevant courts and parties in 2003 a plan was agreed to by various parties the 2003 plan but on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court issued an order denying the confirmation of that 2003 plan on january 29 2009 an amended plan of reorganization the amended pcc plan – which addressed the issues raised by the court when it denied confirmation of the 2003 plan – was filed with the bankruptcy court 

the proposed resolution of pcc asbestos claims under the amended pcc plan would have required corning to contribute its equity interests in pcc and pittsburgh corning europe nv pce a belgian corporation and to contribute a fixed series of payments recorded at present value corning would have had the option to use its shares rather than cash to make these payments but the liability would have been fixed by dollar value and not the number of shares the amended pcc plan would originally have required corning to make 1 one payment of 100 million one year from the date the amended pcc plan becomes effective and certain conditions are met and 2 five additional payments of 50 million on each of the five subsequent anniversaries of the first payment the final payment of which is subject to reduction based on the application of credits under certain circumstances documents were filed with the bankruptcy court further modifying the amended pcc plan by reducing corning’s initial payment by 30 million and reducing its second and fourth payments by 15 million each in return corning would relinquish its claim for reimbursement of its payments and contributions under the amended pcc plan from the insurance carriers involved in the bankruptcy proceeding with certain exceptions 

on june 16 2011 the court entered an order denying confirmation of the amended pcc plan the court’s memorandum opinion accompanying the order rejected some objections to the amended pcc plan and made suggestions regarding modifications to the amended pcc plan that would allow the plan to be confirmed corning and other parties have filed a motion for reconsideration objecting to certain points of this order certain parties to the proceeding filed specific plan modifications in response to the court’s opinion and corning supported these filings certain parties objected to the proposed plan modifications and to resolve some of those objections further revisions to the plan and other documents were filed a modified amended pcc plan was then submitted by pcc and objections to that plan were filed by two parties those objections and the plan are pending before the court 

the amended pcc plan does not include certain nonpcc asbestos claims that may be or have been raised against corning corning has recorded in its estimated asbestos litigation liability an additional 150 million for the approximately 9800 current nonpcc cases alleging injuries from asbestos and for any future nonpcc cases the liability for nonpcc claims was estimated based upon industry data for asbestos claims since corning does not have recent claim history due to the injunction issued by the bankruptcy court the estimated liability represents the undiscounted projection of claims and related legal fees over the next 20 years the amount may need to be adjusted in future periods as more data becomes available 

the amended pcc plan with the modifications addressing issues raised by the court’s june 16 2011 opinion remains subject to a number of contingencies payment of the amounts required to fund the amended pcc plan from insurance and other sources are subject to a number of conditions that may not be achieved the approval of the further modified amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is not certain and faces objections by some parties if the modified amended pcc plan is approved by the bankruptcy court that approval will be subject to appeal for these and other reasons corning’s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters the estimate of the cost of resolving the nonpcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning’s financial statements is remote 

several of corning’s insurers have commenced litigation in state courts for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies including rights that may be affected by the potential resolutions described above corning is vigorously contesting these cases management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation and therefore cannot estimate the range of any possible loss

overview 

although corning’s net income decreased in 2012 when compared to 2011 we ended the year having made good progress towards our goals despite some challenging economic conditions and changing market environments in 2012 we set a record for annual sales performance stabilized our display technologies segment primarily through moderating price declines and continued to grow our new product portfolio 

while corning remains well positioned for the future the economic headwinds which started in 2011 and continued into 2012 impacted the majority of our segments most severely impacted was our display technologies segment due to significant yearoveryear price declines which impacted both our whollyowned business and our display technologies equity affiliates these price declines were driven by excess glass supply and share shifts at several major customers beginning in the latter half of 2011 and continuing into the first quarter of 2012 the supply chain became more balanced during the remainder of 2012 as we saw a better matching of supply and demand for glass resulting in more moderate sequential price declines results in our telecommunications segment declined on higher sales in 2012 driven by an increase in operating expenses the impact of restructuring actions and lower sales of premium fiber products coupled with the absence of a contingent liability reversal recorded in the third quarter of 2011 in the amount of 27 million results also declined in the environmental technologies segment due to a decrease in light duty diesel product sales and the impact of restructuring actions offset slightly by improved manufacturing performance and lower air freight expenses although sales in the life sciences segment increased largely as a result of the acquisition of the discovery labware business and a small acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 segment results declined due to an increase in acquisition–related operating expenses results increased substantially in our specialty materials segment driven by significantly higher sales of our corning gorilla glass used in portable display devices 

for the year ended december 31 2012 we generated net income of 17 billion or 115 per share compared to net income of 28 billion or 177 per share for 2011 when compared to last year the decrease in net income was due largely to the following items 

• 

lower net income in the display technologies segment due to significant price declines at both our whollyowned business and the segment’s equity affiliates 

• 

the impact of restructuring charges totaling 60 million after tax for costs associated with workforce reductions asset writeoffs and exit costs related to corning’s corporatewide restructuring plan announced in the fourth quarter of 2012 

• 

a decline in equity earnings from dow corning due to a significant decrease in earnings at hemlock semiconductor group hemlock dow corning’s consolidated subsidiary that manufactures high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries driven by price and volume declines coupled with restructuring and impairment charges in the amount of 81 million after tax related to workforce reductions and asset writeoffs 

• 

the absence of a tax benefit in the amount of 41 million from amending our 2006 us federal tax return to claim foreign tax credits recorded in the third quarter of 2011 

• 

lower royalty income from our equity affiliate samsung corning precision materials due to the combination of lower sales and the reduction in the royalty rate which took effect in december 2011 and 

• 

an increase in our effective tax rate due to the following 

– 

temporary expiration of favorable us tax provisions the effects of which will be reversed in the first quarter of 2013 due to the retroactive application of the american taxpayer relief act enacted on january 3 2013 

– 

the partial expiration of tax holidays in taiwan and 

– 

change in our mix of earnings 

the decrease in net income in 2012 was offset somewhat by higher net income in our specialty materials segment a 52 million translation gain as a result of the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary and the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 

corning remains committed to a strategy of growing through global innovation this strategy has served us well our key priorities for 2012 were similar to those in prior years protect our financial health and invest in the future during 2012 we made the following progress on these priorities 

financial health 

our financial position remained sound and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities significant items in 2012 included the following 

• 

our debt to capital ratio at december 31 2012 was 14 higher than our debt to capital ratio of 10 at december 31 2011 

• 

operating cash flow for the year was 32 billion consistent with 2011 

• 

we ended the year with over 61 billion of cash and shortterm investments 

• 

corning’s board of directors declared a 20 increase in the company’s quarterly common stock dividend 

• 

we completed a stock repurchase program which began in the fourth quarter of 2011 during 2012 we repurchased 56 million shares of common stock for 720 million this action reflects our belief that our share price is below our intrinsic value and our confidence in our ability to continue to generate strong cash flows in the future 

investing in our future 

we continue to focus on the future and on what we do best – creating keystone components that enable hightechnology systems we remain committed to investing in research development and engineering to drive innovation during 2012 we maintained a balanced innovation strategy focused on growing our existing businesses developing opportunities adjacent or closely related to our existing technical and manufacturing capabilities and investing in long range opportunities in each of our market segments 

we continue to work on new products including glass substrates for high performance displays and lcd applications diesel filters and substrates and the optical fiber cable and hardware and equipment that enable fibertothepremises and next generation data centers in addition we are focusing on wireless solutions for diverse venue applications such as distributed antenna systems fiber to the cell site and fiber to the antenna we have focused our research development and engineering spending to support the advancement of new product attributes for our corning gorilla glass suite of products we will continue to focus on adjacent glass opportunities which leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes including corning® willow™ glass our ultraslim flexible glass substrate for use in nextgeneration consumer electronic technologies 

our research development and engineering expenditures increased by 74 million in 2012 when compared to 2011 but remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales we believe our spending levels are appropriate to support our technology and innovation strategies 

capital spending decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 in 2010 corning announced several multiyear investment plans to increase manufacturing capacity in several of our reportable segments specifically the projects focused on an lcd glass substrate facility in china for our display technologies segment and a capacity expansion project for specialty materials’ corning gorilla glass in japan although spending for these projects continued into 2012 the majority of the construction costs were incurred in 2011 resulting in a significant decrease in capital spending in those segments slightly offsetting the decline was an increase in capital spending in the telecommunications segment driven by capacity expansion in our fiber business total capital expenditures for 2012 were 18 billion in 2012 approximately 900 million was invested in our display technologies segment 

corning incorporated – 2012 form 10k 18

back to contents 

we expect our 2013 capital spending to be about 13 billion approximately 500 million will be allocated to our display technologies segment of which approximately 200 million will be related to spending on 2012 capital projects 

corporate outlook 

while corning will not be without challenges in 2013 due to the uncertainty of the global economy we expect sales to grow in our telecommunications life sciences specialty materials and environmental technologies segments and for our market share to stabilize and price declines to be moderate in our display technologies segment a rise in global demand for corning’s optical fiber and cable combined with growth of enterprise network solutions products and fibertothepremises sales in australia should propel the sales improvement in our telecommunications segment our recent acquisition of the majority of the discovery labware business of becton dickinson and company is expected to drive the life sciences segment sales growth in 2013 we believe the overall lcd glass retail market in 2013 will increase in the midtohigh single digits from 35 billion square feet in 2012 driven by the combination of an increase in retail sales of lcd televisions and the demand for larger television screen sizes net income may be negatively impacted by lower equity earnings from our equity affiliate dow corning and the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates we may take advantage of acquisition opportunities that support the longterm strategies of our businesses we remain confident that our strategy to grow through global innovation while preserving our financial stability will enable our continued longterm success 

results of operations 

selected highlights from our continuing operations follow dollars in millions 

 net sales 

net sales in 2012 increased slightly when compared to the prior year due to sales growth in the specialty materials telecommunications and life sciences segments offset almost entirely by a decrease in sales in our display technologies segment sales in the specialty materials segment increased by doubledigits due to the strong demand for corning gorilla glass that is used as cover glass in portable handheld display devices tablets and notebook computers telecommunications segment sales increased primarily due to sales growth in wireless and fibertothepremises products the increase in sales in our life sciences segment was driven by the acquisition of the bd discovery labware business in the fourth quarter of 2012 and by the small acquisition we completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 which produces highquality cell culture media additionally net sales were positively impacted by movements in foreign exchange rates 

net sales in 2011 increased 19 when compared to 2010 due to sales growth in all of our segments with the largest increases occurring in the specialty materials telecommunications and environmental segments sales in the specialty materials segment increased by 86 due to the strong demand for corning gorilla glass that is used as cover glass in portable handheld display devices tablets and notebook computers telecommunications segment sales increased due to strength across all of their product lines most significantly in optical fiber and cable and fibertothepremises products sales in the environmental technologies segment were higher driven by higher demand for our diesel products additionally net sales were positively impacted by movements in foreign exchange rates 

corning incorporated – 2012 form 10k 19

back to contents 

in 2012 net sales into international markets accounted for 77 of net sales for 2011 and 2010 net sales into international markets accounted for 78 and 74 respectively of net sales 

cost of sales 

the types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are raw materials consumption including direct and indirect materials salaries wages and benefits depreciation and amortization production utilities productionrelated purchasing warehousing including receiving and inspection repairs and maintenance interlocation inventory transfer costs production and warehousing facility property insurance rent for production facilities and other production overhead 

gross margin 

for 2012 gross margin dollars and as a percentage of sales decreased when compared to 2011 due to the impact of significant price declines in our display technologies segment partially offsetting this decline was improvement in our specialty materials segment where significantly higher sales increased manufacturing efficiency and the absence of large cover glass startup and tank conversion costs incurred in 2011 led to a doubledigit increase in gross margin 

for 2011 gross margin dollars increased when compared to 2010 but declined slightly as a percentage of sales improvements in gross margin were driven by the impact of strong sales in the specialty materials segment along with volume increases and manufacturing efficiency gains in the environmental technologies segment offsetting these gains were the impacts of significant price declines in our display technologies segment and large cover glass startup and tank conversion costs 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2012 increased when compared to 2011 due primarily to an increase in performancebased compensation costs expenses associated with the acquisition of the bd discovery labware business and the absence of a credit in the amount of 27 million resulting from a reduction in a contingent liability associated with an acquisition recorded in 2011 as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses in 2012 increased when compared to 2011 due to the increase in spending described above and relatively consistent net sales year over year 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2011 increased slightly when compared to 2010 due primarily to an increase in salaries partially as a result of three small acquisitions completed in 2011 and in the latter half of 2010 offset by an adjustment to performancebased compensation costs and a credit of 27 million resulting from a reduction in a contingent liability associated with an acquisition recorded in the first quarter of 2011 as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses in 2011 were down considerably when compared to 2010 

the types of expenses included in the selling general and administrative expenses line item are salaries wages and benefits travel sales commissions professional fees and depreciation and amortization utilities and rent for administrative facilities 

research development and engineering expenses 

research development and engineering expenses increased by 11 in 2012 when compared to 2011 but remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales during 2012 corning’s research development and engineering focused on new product development as well as adjacent glass opportunities which leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes we believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies 

research development and engineering expenses for 2011 increased by 68 million to 671 million in 2011 when compared to 2010 but remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales corning’s research development and engineering expenses focused on our specialty materials and telecommunications segments as we strive to capitalize on growth opportunities in those segments 

restructuring impairment and other charges and credits 

corning recorded restructuring impairment and other charges and credits in 2012 2011 and 2010 which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented additional information on restructuring and asset impairment is found in note 2 restructuring impairment and other charges credits note 9 property net of accumulated depreciation and note 16 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements a description of those charges and credits follows 

2012 activity 

in response to uncertain global economic conditions and the potential for slower growth in many of our businesses in 2013 corning implemented a corporatewide restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded charges of 89 million before tax which included costs for workforce reductions asset writeoffs and exit costs total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately 49 million with the majority of spending for employeerelated costs completed in 2013 annualized savings from these actions are estimated to be approximately 71 million and will be reflected largely in selling general and administrative expenses 

the specialty materials segment recorded an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2011 in the amount of 130 million related to certain assets used in the production of large cover glass due to sales that were significantly below our expectations in the fourth quarter of 2012 after reassessing the large cover glass business corning concluded that the large cover glass market was developing differently in 2012 than our expectations demand for largersized cover glass was declining and the market for this type of glass was instead targeting smaller gen size products additionally in the fourth quarter of 2012 our primary customer of large cover glass notified corning of its decision to exit from this display market based on these events we recorded an additional impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the amount of 44 million before tax this impairment charge represents a writedown of assets specific to the glassstrengthening process for large size cover glass to their fair market values and includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process

2011 activity 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 the specialty materials segment recorded an impairment charge in the amount of 130 million related to certain assets located in japan used in the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass large cover glass is primarily used as a cover sheet of strengthened glass for frameless bezelless lcd displays the large cover glass impairment charge represents a writedown of assets specific to the glassstrengthening process for large size cover glass to their relative fair market values as of the date of impairment this asset group includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process and facilities dedicated to the ion exchange process 

2010 activity 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded 324 million in other credits as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims resulting from two events which impacted production at several of our lcd glass manufacturing facilities in august 2009 an earthquake halted production at one of our lcd glass manufacturing facilities in japan and in october 2009 production at our facility in taichung taiwan was impacted by a power disruption 

asbestos litigation 

in 2012 we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of 14 million compared to an increase of 24 million in 2011 in 2010 we recorded a net decrease to our asbestos litigation liability of 49 million the net decrease in 2010 was due primarily to a 54 million decrease to our estimated liability for asbestos litigation that was recorded in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the change in terms of the proposed settlement of the pcc asbestos claims for the remainder of 2010 we recorded net credit adjustments to our asbestos litigation liability of 5 million to reflect the change in value of the estimated settlement liability 

our asbestos litigation liability was estimated to be 671 million at december 31 2012 compared with an estimate of 657 million at december 31 2011 the entire obligation is classified as a noncurrent liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than 12 months after the proposed amended pcc plan is ultimately effective and a portion of the obligation will be fulfilled through the direct contribution of corning’s investment in pce currently recorded as a noncurrent other equity method investment

equity in earnings of affiliated companies 

the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies in millions 

 equity earnings of affiliated companies decreased in 2012 reflecting lower earnings performance at both samsung corning precision materials and at dow corning when compared to last year 

the change in equity earnings from samsung corning precision materials is explained more fully in the discussion of the performance of the display technologies segment and in all other 

equity earnings from dow corning decreased substantially in 2012 when compared to 2011 beginning in the latter half of 2011 and continuing into 2012 dow corning began experiencing unfavorable industry conditions at its consolidated subsidiary hemlock semiconductor group hemlock a producer of high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries driven by overcapacity at all levels of the solar industry supply chain this overcapacity led to significant declines in polycrystalline spot prices in the fourth quarter of 2011 and prices remained depressed throughout 2012 also potentially impacting this business is a chinese ministry of commerce mofcom antidumping and countervailing duty investigation of imports of solargrade polycrystalline solar products from the us and korea if the chinese authorities rule that dumping or subsidization took place they may impose additional duties on future imports of solargrade polycrystalline silicon to china from the us 

due to the conditions and uncertainties described above sales volume has declined and production levels of certain operating assets have been reduced as a result dow corning determined that a polycrystalline silicon plant expansion previously delayed since the fourth quarter of 2011 would no longer be economically viable and made the decision to abandon this expansion activity in the fourth quarter of 2012 the abandonment resulted in an impairment charge of 57 million before tax for corning’s share of the write down in the value of these constructioninprogress assets further the startup of another plant expansion that was expected to begin production in 2013 is being delayed until sales volumes increase to levels necessary to support operations 

additionally during the fourth quarter of 2012 the events and circumstances described above indicated that additional assets of dow corning’s polycrystalline silicon business might be impaired in accordance with accounting guidance for impairment of longlived assets dow corning compared estimated undiscounted cash flows to the assets’ carrying value and determined that the asset group is recoverable as of december 31 2012 however it is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted cash flows could change in the near term resulting in the need to write down those assets to fair value if a significant adverse duty is imposed by mofcom or there is continued pricing deterioration or other adverse market conditions that result in nonperformance by customers under longterm contracts dow corning’s estimates of cash flows might change partially mitigating the adverse circumstances described above are longterm contracts that dow corning established in preparation for this negative volatility these longterm contracts contain customer prepayment requirements as well as a provision that the customers “take or pay” the contracted volume of the polycrystalline silicon over the life of the contract corning’s share of the carrying value of this asset group is approximately 700 million after tax 

in addition to the significant declines in polycrystalline silicon prices and the impairment charge described above equity earnings from dow corning were also negatively impacted in 2012 by the following items 

• 

corning’s share of the restructuring actions taken in the silicone products segment associated with workforce reductions and the impairment of assets in the amount of 30 million before tax 

• 

higher operating expenses due to an increase in pension expense severance expense and compensation accruals 

• 

price declines for silicone products and 

• 

the unfavorable impact from movements in foreign exchange rates 

corning incorporated – 2012 form 10k 21

back to contents 

the decrease in equity earnings from dow corning in 2012 was offset somewhat by the following items 

• 

a gain in the amount of 10 million before tax associated with the resolution of a contract dispute by hemlock against one of its customers relating to enforcement of longterm supply agreements 

• 

an increase in volume for silicone products and 

• 

lower interest expense 

the decline in equity earnings from dow corning in 2011 when compared to 2010 was primarily due to the following items 

• 

an increase in raw material costs of slightly above 100 million 

• 

a sales shift from higher priced higher margin silicones to lower priced lower margin silicones and 

• 

a decrease in advanced energy manufacturing tax credits 

the decrease in equity earnings from dow corning was partially offset by a gain in the amount of 89 million associated with the resolution of a contract dispute by hemlock against one of its customers relating to enforcement of longterm supply agreements 

other income expense net 

“other income expense net” in corning’s consolidated statements of income includes the following in millions 

 royalty income from samsung corning precision materials decreased significantly in 2012 when compared to 2011 reflecting a decrease in the applicable royalty rate coupled with a decline in sales volume at samsung corning precision materials in december 2011 the applicable royalty rate was reduced for a fiveyear period by approximately 50 compared to the prior five years 

income before income taxes 

in addition to the items identified under gross margin restructuring impairment and other charges credits asbestos litigation charge credit and other income net movements in foreign exchange rates also had a slightly positive impact for the years presented 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows in millions 

 the effective income tax rate for 2012 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

• 

rate differences on incomelosses of consolidated foreign companies partially offset by us tax on deemed repatriated earnings of which 37 million will be reversed in the first quarter of 2013 due to the retroactive application of the american taxpayer relief act enacted on january 3 2013 

• 

the impact of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates reported in the financials net of tax and 

• 

the benefit of tax incentives in foreign jurisdictions primarily taiwan 

the effective income tax rate for 2011 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

• 

rate differences on incomelosses of consolidated foreign companies 

• 

the impact of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates reported in the financials net of tax 

• 

the benefit of tax incentives in foreign jurisdictions primarily taiwan and 

• 

a 41 million tax benefit from amending our 2006 us federal return to claim foreign tax credits 

the effective income tax rate for 2010 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

• 

rate differences on incomelosses of consolidated foreign companies 

• 

the impact of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates reported in the financials net of tax 

• 

the benefit of tax incentives in foreign jurisdictions primarily taiwan 

• 

the benefit of excess foreign tax credits from repatriation of current year earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and 

• 

the impact of the reversal of the deferred tax assets associated with a tax exempt subsidy attributable to our other postretirement benefits liability 

corning has valuation allowances on certain shorterlived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss carry forwards and state tax net operating loss carry forwards as well as other foreign net operating loss carry forwards and federal and state tax credits because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire us profits of approximately 71 billion will be required to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of december 31 2012 of that amount 38 billion of us profits will be required over the next 13 years to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with federal net operating loss and credit carry forwards the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized as the underlying temporary differences reverse over an extended period the amount of us and foreign deferred tax assets that had valuation allowances at december 31 2012 and 2011 was 210 million and 219 million respectively

we currently provide income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies to the extent these earnings are currently taxable or not indefinitely reinvested as of december 31 2012 taxes have not been provided on approximately 119 billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings that are expected to remain invested indefinitely it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings 

our foreign subsidiary in taiwan operates under various tax holiday arrangements the nature and extent of such arrangements vary and the benefits of such arrangements phase out through 2015 the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 16 20 and 31 percentage points for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

while we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next 12 months we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position

the decrease in net sales in 2012 when compared to 2011 reflects significant price declines which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 driven by customer and competitive pressures associated with share shifts at several major customers in a period of excess glass supply sequential price declines became much more moderate in the second and third quarters of 2012 reflecting a better matching of supply and demand for glass and more stable levels of inventory in the lcd supply chain in the third and fourth quarter of 2012 corning entered into new agreements with key customers these agreements stabilize corning’s share at each of the customers and maintain a fixed relationship between corning’s pricing and competitive pricing at that customer fourth quarter sequential price declines were slightly higher than the prior two quarters due to some initial adjustments to line up corning’s prior pricing with the requirements of these new agreements retail demand for largersized lcd televisions drove a doubledigit increase in volume in our whollyowned business in 2012 when compared to the prior year and slightly offset the price declines described above movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales of this segment 

the decrease in equity earnings from our display technologies equity affiliates in 2012 when compared to 2011 reflected substantial price declines driven by the circumstances described above relatively consistent volume and share loss at a key customer also negatively impacting equity earnings were restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2012 consisting largely of tank and finishing line asset writeoffs in the amount of 18 million although equity earnings of the equity affiliates of this segment are impacted by movements in both the us dollar – japanese yen and us dollar – korean won exchange rates movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact equity earnings for the year ended december 31 2012 

when compared to 2011 the decrease in net income in 2012 reflects the impact of price declines described above at both our whollyowned business and the segment equity affiliates a reduction in royalty income and the impact of restructuring actions partially offset by a doubledigit increase in volume at our whollyowned business restructuring costs in this segment totaled approximately 21 million before tax and consisted primarily of the writeoff of finishing line assets located in japan and exit costs for the consolidation of office space movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net income of this segment 

a number of corning’s patents and knowhow are licensed to samsung corning precision materials as well as to third parties which generates royalty income royalty income from samsung corning precision materials decreased significantly in 2012 when compared to 2011 reflecting a decrease in the applicable royalty rate coupled with a decline in sales volume at samsung corning precision materials in december 2011 the applicable royalty rate was reduced for a fiveyear period by approximately 50 compared to the prior five years refer to note 7 investments to the consolidated financial statements for more information about related party transactions 

2011 vs 2010 

the end market for lcd televisions was up slightly in 2011 with unit growth rates remaining consistent with or exceeding our expectations across all geographic regions additionally largersized lcd televisions were the fastest growing size category in 2011 and have resulted in area growth rates that were even higher than unit growth rates however because corning sells to panel makers and not to end market consumers supply chain expansion and contraction for this industry are key factors in corning’s sales volume while end market demand continues to grow in all lcd applications inventory levels within the lcd supply chain have not kept pace with this growth and have in fact declined in absolute terms during 2011 when compared to 2010 resulting in lower volume and excess capacity in the supply chain as a result corning announced in the fourth quarter of 2011 that it would reduce capacity at our whollyowned business by delaying the startup of new glass melting tanks as well as postponing the relight of tanks that were removed from service for normal repair our equity affiliate samsung corning precision materials took similar actions in the fourth quarter of 2011 

the slight increase in net sales in the display technologies segment in 2011 compared to 2010 was driven primarily by the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates net sales of this segment are denominated in japanese yen and as a result are susceptible to movements in the us dollarjapanese yen exchange rate volume growth in 2011 was more than offset by price declines when compared to 2010 

when compared to 2010 the decrease in equity earnings from samsung corning precision materials in 2011 reflected volume and price declines offset somewhat by the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates equity earnings of samsung corning precision materials are impacted by movements in both the us dollar – japanese yen and us dollar – korean won exchange rates the impact of the supply chain contraction and excess capacity in 2011 has been more severe in korea resulting in higher price and volume declines at samsung corning precision materials than at our whollyowned business additionally in the fourth quarter of 2011 although samsung corning precision materials significantly reduced its glass pricing in light of the current state of glass supply in the industry it did not recover market share that was lost in the third quarter due to these market dynamics samsung corning precision materials reduced its glass melting capacity as described above equity earnings were also negatively impacted by higher taxes due to the partial expiration of a korean tax holiday and the absence of a 61 million credit for our share of a revised tax holiday calculation agreed to by the korean national tax service recorded in 2010 

when compared to 2010 the decrease in net income in the display technologies segment in 2011 reflects the impact of lower equity earnings price declines and a decrease in royalty income partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiency and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate movements net income was also negatively impacted by the absence of a pretax credit recorded in 2010 in the amount of 324 million as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims 

other information 

the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan china and taiwan in 2012 three customers of the display technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for a combined 63 of total segment sales for 2011 four customers of the display technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for 77 of total segment sales for 2010 three customers of the display technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for 72 of total segment sales our customers face the same global economic dynamics as we do in this market our nearterm sales and profitability would be impacted if any of these significant customers were unable to continue to purchase our products 

in addition samsung corning precision materials’ sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers in 2012 2011 and 2010 sales to two lcd panel makers located in korea accounted for approximately 93 of samsung corning precision materials sales in each of those three years 

corning has invested heavily to expand capacity to meet the projected demand for lcd glass substrates in 2012 2011 and 2010 capital spending in this segment was 853 million 13 billion and 497 million respectively we expect capital spending for 2013 to be approximately 500 million of which approximately 200 million will be related to spending on 2012 capital projects

outlook 

we expect the overall lcd glass retail market to be up midtohigh single digits in 2013 from 35 billion square feet in 2012 we believe that the longterm market drivers will be lcd television growth driven by growth of largersized lcd televisions and increased demand in emerging regions 

in the first quarter of 2013 we expect volume at our whollyowned business and our segment equity affiliates to increase when compared to the first quarter of 2012 but to be down sequentially by midsingle digits we expect price declines in our wholly owned business in the first quarter of 2013 to be more moderate when compared to the previous quarter and for price declines at our segment equity affiliates to be consistent with the prior quarter 

the end market demand for lcd televisions monitors and notebooks is dependent on consumer retail spending among other things we are cautious about the potential negative impacts that economic conditions particularly a global economic recession excess market capacity and world political tensions could have on consumer demand while the industry has grown rapidly in recent years economic volatility along with consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes prices or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth therefore it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time we may incur further charges in this segment to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity in addition changes in foreign exchange rates principally the japanese yen will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment 

telecommunications 

 2012 vs 2011 

net sales for the segment were up slightly when compared to 2011 driven by increased demand for optical fiber and cable in china fibertothepremises products in australia and wireless products this growth was offset somewhat by declines in demand for legacy copper products and the negative impact of foreign exchange rate movements 

the decrease in net income in 2012 reflects the impact of restructuring actions lower sales of premium fiber products an increase in research and development expenses an increase in project spending and the absence of a contingent liability reversal recorded in 2011 in the amount of 27 million somewhat offsetting the decrease in net income was a translation gain in the amount of 52 million for the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the partial reversal of a warranty reserve related to our fibertothepremises and fiber optic cable products in the pretax amount of 10 million recorded in the third quarter of 2012 net income of this segment in 2012 included approximately 39 million of restructuring charges associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan which included headcount reductions asset writeoffs and the writeoff of a small equity affiliate in japan movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net income of this segment 

the telecommunications segment has a concentrated customer base in the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 one customer which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for 12 12 and 15 respectively of total segment net sales 

2011 vs 2010 

in 2011 net sales of the telecommunications segment increased when compared to 2010 due to higher sales in all of the segment’s product lines led by fibertothepremises optical fiber and cable and enterprise network products sales of fibertothepremises products increased 39 driven by initiatives in canada europe and australia optical fiber and cable sales growth reflected record volume moderating price declines and an increase in sales of premium products sales also increased due to a small acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2011 and the positive impact from movements in foreign exchange rates 

the increase in net income in 2011 when compared to 2010 reflects higher volume across all product lines and an increase in sales of higher margin products coupled with a credit in the amount of 27 million for the decrease in a contingent liability associated with a first quarter acquisition the increase in net income was offset slightly by the impact of higher raw materials and project costs associated with our initiatives in australia and europe movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of net income for the periods presented 

outlook 

we expect a strong year of sales growth in the telecommunications segment in 2013 driven by an increase in global demand for our optical fiber and cable a significant rampup of our fibertothepremises initiative in australia and strong growth of our enterprise network products in the first quarter of 2013 we expect net sales of this segment to increase when compared to the same period last year 

changes in our customers’ expected deployment plans or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fibertothepremises products could also affect sales levels should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated our sales and earnings would be adversely affected

environmental technologies 

 2012 vs 2011 

net sales of this segment decreased in 2012 when compared to 2011 due to a decline in net sales of our diesel products and the negative impact of movements in foreign exchange rates although sales of light duty diesel products decreased due to a decline in demand for vehicles in europe requiring light duty diesel filters sales of our heavy duty diesel products increased 8 in 2012 partially offsetting the decrease in light duty diesel sales during the latter half of 2012 however the rate of growth of heavy duty products declined driven by a slowing of class 8 truck orders in north america sales of our automotive products increased in 2012 when compared to 2011 on continued growth in worldwide automotive production led by growth in north america 

net income in 2012 decreased slightly driven by a decrease in sales of light duty diesel products offset somewhat by an increase in heavy duty diesel volume improved manufacturing performance and a decrease in air freight costs when compared to the same period last year in 2012 net income of this segment included approximately 3 million before tax of restructuring charges associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of net income for the periods presented 

the environmental technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of catalyzer and emission control systems manufacturers who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers the use of our substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel vehicle or engine manufacturers for 2012 2011 and 2010 net sales to three customers which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment sales accounted for 86 85 and 86 respectively of total segment sales while we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues with our direct customers our nearterm sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products 

2011 vs 2010 

when compared to 2010 net sales in the environmental technologies segment increased in 2011 primarily due to higher sales of diesel products the increase was driven by an increase in truck production in the united states implementation of european governmental regulations on light duty diesel vehicles and the first stages of the implementation of offroad vehicle regulations in the united states sales of our automotive products also increased slightly in 2011 when compared to 2010 reflecting the continuing growth of worldwide automotive production net sales of this segment in 2011 were not materially impacted by movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2010 

net income in 2011 increased 181 when compared to 2010 due to higher sales volume for our diesel products combined with reduced air freight expense and improved manufacturing performance in both diesel and automotive product lines the increase in net income was slightly offset by higher depreciation and project costs on manufacturing capacity expansion movements in foreign exchange rates in 2011 did not materially impact the results of this segment when compared to 2010 

outlook 

in 2013 we anticipate that the worldwide auto and heavyduty diesel truck markets should grow when compared to 2012 we expect net sales of this segment to decline in the first quarter of 2013 when compared to record quarterly sales in the same period last year 

specialty materials 

 2012 vs 2011 

the specialty materials segment manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs consequently this segment operates in a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets that include display optics and components semiconductor optics components aerospace and defense astronomy ophthalmic products telecommunications components and a protective cover glass that is optimized for portable display devices and televisions 

net sales in 2012 increased in the specialty materials segment when compared to the same period in 2011 driven by a significant increase in sales volume of corning gorilla glass sales of corning gorilla glass have continued to increase due to a combination of strong retail demand for handheld display devices tablets and notebook computers and an increase in usage of our glass on these devices moderate price declines for corning gorilla glass and lower sales of our advanced optics products partially offset the increase in net sales movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales of this reportable segment in 2012 

corning incorporated – 2012 form 10k 26

back to contents 

when compared to the same period last year the increase in net income in 2012 was driven by the increase in sales of corning gorilla glass combined with increased manufacturing efficiency and the absence of large cover glass startup and tank conversion costs incurred in 2011 also impacting results of this segment was the net positive difference in large cover glass asset writeoffs in 2012 versus 2011 in the pretax amount of 86 million net income included approximately 10 million pretax of restructuring charges associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan which included headcount reductions and asset writeoffs related to our advanced optics product line net income was not significantly impacted from movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the same period in 2011 

for 2012 two customers of the specialty materials segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment sales accounted for 54 of total segment sales for 2011 two customers of the specialty materials segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment sales accounted for 42 of total segment sales for 2010 three customers of the specialty materials segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment sales accounted for 43 of total segment sales 

2011 vs 2010 

net sales in 2011 increased significantly in the specialty materials segment driven by sales of corning gorilla glass which more than doubled when compared to 2010 and a modest increase in semiconductor optics and aerospace and defense products movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales of this segment in 2011 sales of corning gorilla glass increased considerably especially during the first nine months of 2011 due to a combination of strong retail demand for handheld display devices tablets and notebook computers and increased usage of our glass on these devices although sales of corning gorilla glass used in our large cover glass products increased in 2011 when compared to 2010 sales were significantly below our expectations in 2011 and are expected to be lower than forecasted in 2012 as a result certain assets located in japan used in the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass were impaired in the fourth quarter of 2011 this asset group includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process and facilities dedicated to the ion exchange process the specialty materials segment reduced capacity for its corning gorilla glass products including the impairment of large cover glass assets in the fourth quarter of 2011 as part of corning’s worldwide capacity reduction of approximately 25 

the slight increase in net loss in 2011 when compared to 2010 was driven by the large cover glass asset impairment charge in the amount of 130 million pretax offset by the considerable increase in sales volume of our corning gorilla glass used in handheld display devices tablets and notebook computers net income was also impacted somewhat by declines in manufacturing efficiency caused primarily by startup costs for large cover glass and glass tank conversions necessary to increase manufacturing capacity for corning gorilla glass in 2011 as well as the negative impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 

outlook 

for 2013 we expect double digit market growth for corning gorilla glass driven by its continued popularity as a cover glass for smartphones and tablets and the emergence of touch technology on notebook computers in the first quarter of 2013 we expect net sales to decline sequentially and compared to the same period in 2012 

life sciences 

 2012 vs 2011 

net sales in 2012 increased due to the impact of the acquisition of the majority of the discovery labware business which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2012 and a small acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 as well as a slight increase in the segment’s existing product lines the acquisitions support the company’s strategy to expand corning’s portfolio of life sciences products and enhance global customer access in this business and accounted for 65 million of the increase in sales in 2012 when compared to 2011 the negative impact of foreign exchange rate movements partially offset the increase in sales 

the decrease in net income in 2012 reflects the impact of higher raw materials costs and operating expenses in the amount of 22 million related to the acquisition of a majority of the discovery labware business which more than offset the favorable impact of the increase in net sales also negatively impacting net income of this segment in 2012 was approximately 2 million of restructuring charges associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce global headcount net income in 2012 was not significantly impacted by movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the same period in 2011 

for 2012 2011 and 2010 two customers in the life sciences segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of total segment net sales collectively accounted for 38 39 and 37 respectively of total segment sales 

2011 vs 2010 

net sales in 2011 increased when compared to 2010 due to a small acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2010 and higher sales in the segment’s existing product lines net sales in 2011 were not significantly impacted by movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2010 

net income in 2011 was consistent with 2010 reflecting costs for manufacturing expansion projects higher raw materials costs and the impact of the integration of the acquisition completed in 2010 offset by modest volume and price increases net income of this segment was not significantly impacted by movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2010 

outlook 

sales in the life sciences segment are expected to increase in both the first quarter and full year of 2013 primarily due to the impact of the discovery labware business acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2012

all other 

 all other includes all other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting this group is primarily comprised of development projects that involve the use of various technologies for new products such as advanced flow reactors thinfilm photovoltaics and adjacency businesses in pursuit of thin strong glass this segment also includes results for certain corporate investments such as samsung corning precision materials’ nonlcd glass businesses eurokera and keraglass equity affiliates which manufacture smooth cooktop glassceramic products and corsam technologies llc corsam an equity affiliate established between corning and samsung corning precision materials to provide glass technology research refer to note 7 investments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about samsung corning precision materials and related party transactions 

2012 vs 2011 

the results of this segment for the year ended 2012 when compared to the same period last year reflect an increase in research development and engineering expenses for development projects offset by a gain on the sale of assets in samsung corning precision materials’ nonlcd glass business 

2011 vs 2010 

the increase in net loss in 2011 when compared to 2010 in this segment was driven by lower equity earnings from samsung corning precision materials’ nonlcd glass businesses partially offset by lower research development and engineering expenses

on october 5 2011 corning’s board of directors approved the repurchase of up to 15 billion of common stock between the date of the announcement and december 31 2013 corning finalized the repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2012 and repurchased a total of 111 million shares for 15 billion during the program 

• 

in the second quarter of 2011 a whollyowned subsidiary entered into a credit facility that allows corning to borrow up to chinese renminbi rmb 40 billion or approximately 642 million when translated to united states dollars corning was able to request advances during the eighteen month period beginning on june 30 2011 the “availability period” the time period for corning to draw under the rmb facility expired at the end of 2012 our financing agreement requires us to repay the aggregate principal amount and accrued interest outstanding at the end of the availability period in six installments with the final payment due in august 2016 five years from the date of the first advance corning also has the right to repay this loan in full at predetermined dates with no prepayment penalty in 2012 we borrowed the equivalent of approximately 377 million from this credit facility 

capital spending 

capital spending was 18 billion in 2012 a decrease of 631 million when compared to 2011 in 2010 corning announced several multiyear investment plans to increase manufacturing capacity in several of our reportable segments specifically the projects focused on an lcd glass substrate facility in china for our display technologies segment and a capacity expansion project for specialty materials’ corning gorilla glass in japan although spending for these projects continued into 2012 the majority of the construction costs were incurred in 2011 resulting in a significant decrease in capital spending in those segments in 2012 slightly offsetting the decline was an increase in capital spending in the telecommunications segment driven by capacity expansion in our fiber business we expect our 2013 capital expenditures to be approximately 13 billion approximately 500 million will be allocated to our display technologies segment of which approximately 200 million will be related to spending on 2012 capital projects

cash flows 

summary of cash flow data in millions 

 2012 vs 2011 

although 2012 net income declined when compared to 2011 operating cash flow remained relatively consistent the decrease in net income resulted primarily from the noncash impacts of significantly lower equity earnings and the absence of the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates experienced in 2011 the cash impact of higher dividends and a net positive change in working capital also effected operating cash flow 

net cash used in investing activities increased in 2012 when compared to 2011 due to the acquisition of the majority of the discovery labware business from becton dickinson and company an investment in an affiliated company and lower cash received from shortterm investment liquidations offset slightly by a decrease in capital spending 

net cash used in financing activities decreased in 2012 when compared to 2011 primarily due to the proceeds received from the issuance of longterm debt coupled with a decline in cash used for stock repurchases in 2012 somewhat offsetting the decrease in net cash used were the impacts of retiring longterm debt and a decline in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options 

2011 vs 2010 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2011 when compared to 2010 driven largely by a nonrecurring special dividend of almost 900 million received from samsung corning precision materials in 2010 and a decrease in cash from changes in working capital additionally in 2011 we received 66 million for the remainder of the settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims a decrease of 193 million from the amount we received in 2010 as partial payment for these claims these negative events were partially offset by a 350 million decrease in contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2011 

net cash used in investing activities was higher in 2011 when compared to 2010 due to an increase in capital spending and two small acquisitions completed in 2011 capital spending was driven primarily by capacity projects to support growth in demand in our display technologies and specialty materials segments the increase in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by higher cash received from shortterm investments liquidations 

net cash used in financing activities increased in 2011 when compared to 2010 driven by common stock repurchases and an increase in our dividend rate from 005 per share to 0075 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011 

defined benefit pension plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees our largest single pension plan is corning’s us qualified plan at december 31 2012 this plan accounted for 80 of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation and 90 of the related plans’ assets 

we have historically contributed to the us qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the irs minimum requirements and as a result mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until sometime after 2013 in 2012 we made voluntary cash contributions of 75 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and 30 million to our international pension plans in 2011 we made no voluntary cash contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and 5 million to our international pension plans 

although we will not be subject to any mandatory contributions in 2013 we anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of up to 60 million to our us pension plan and up to 5 million to our international pension plans in 2013 

refer to note 13 employee retirement plans to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

restructuring 

in response to uncertain global economic conditions and the potential for slower 2013 growth in many of our businesses corning implemented a corporatewide restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded charges of 89 million which included costs for workforce reductions asset disposals and writeoffs and exit costs total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately 49 million with the majority of spending for employeerelated costs completed by 2013 annualized savings from these actions are estimated to be approximately 71 million and will be reflected largely in selling general and administrative expenses 

during 2012 2011 and 2010 we made payments of 8 million 16 million and 66 million respectively related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions refer to note 2 restructuring impairment and other charges credits to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

key balance sheet data 

balance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table dollars in millions 

 credit ratings 

as of february 13 2013 our credit ratings were as follows 

 management assessment of liquidity 

we ended the fourth quarter of 2012 with over 61 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments the company has adequate sources of liquidity and we are confident in our ability to generate cash to meet existing or reasonably likely future cash requirements our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted at december 31 2012 approximately 75 of the consolidated amount was held outside of the us almost all of the amounts held outside of the us are available for repatriation subject to relevant tax consequences we utilize a variety of tax effective financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed in the fourth quarter of 2010 we repatriated to the us approximately 11 billion of 2010 earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries we expect previously accumulated nonus cash balances will remain outside of the us in addition to the cash repatriated in 2010 we expect that we will meet us liquidity needs through future cash flows use of us cash balances external borrowings or some combination of these sources 

realized gains and losses for 2012 2011 and 2010 were not significant volatility in financial markets may limit corning’s access to capital markets and result in terms and conditions that by historical comparisons are more restrictive and costly to corning still from time to time we may issue debt the proceeds of which may be used to refinance certain debt maturities and for general corporate purposes in february 2013 the company obtained authorization from the board of directors to execute a series of foreign exchange contracts over a two year period to hedge our exposure to movements in the japanese yen and its impact on our earnings the company’s execution of these contracts will be dependent upon market conditions the foreign exchange contracts will not be designated derivatives and will be marked to market through the other income line and could be material to our consolidated statements of income 

during 2012 and 2011 we repurchased 56 million and 55 million shares of common stock for 720 million and 780 million respectively as part of a share repurchase program announced on october 5 2011 there were no repurchases in 2010 

we complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk we closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues we currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues 

our major source of funding for 2012 and beyond will be our operating cash flow and our existing balances of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments as well as proceeds from any potential issuances of debt we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations the asbestos litigation research and development capital expenditures scheduled debt repayments and current dividend payments 

corning has access to a 10 billion unsecured committed revolving line of credit we also have amounts outstanding of 497 million under a 40 billion chinese renminbi rmb credit facility approximately 642 million when translated to usd the time period for corning to draw under the rmb facility expired at the end of 2012 these two credit facilities include two financial covenants a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio the required leverage ratio which measures debt to total capital is a maximum of 50 at december 31 2012 and 2011 our leverage using this measure was 14 and 10 respectively the required interest coverage ratio which is an adjusted earnings measure as defined by our facility compared to interest expense is a ratio of at least 35 times at december 31 2012 and 2011 our interest coverage ratio using this measure was 360 times and 417 times respectively at december 31 2012 and 2011 we were in compliance with both financial covenants

our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events in addition the majority of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision whereby a default on one debt obligation of the company in excess of a specified amount also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with all such provisions 

management is not aware of any known trends demands commitments events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in our liquidity in addition other than items discussed there are no known material trends favorable or unfavorable in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources 

off balance sheet arrangements 

off balance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 

corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include the following 

• 

guarantee contracts and 

• 

variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities 

at the time a guarantee is issued the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant 

refer to note 14 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

for variable interest entities we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of its expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests which are the ownership contractual or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests 

corning has identified four entities that qualify as variable interest entities none of these entities is considered to be significant to corning’s consolidated statements of position 

corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit liquidity or market risk support to that entity 

contractual obligations 

the amounts of our obligations follow in millions

additionally we have agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow corning the funding of the dow corning credit facility will be required only if dow corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed bankruptcy plan we believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 

environment 

corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 17 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by the agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2012 and 2011 corning had accrued approximately 21 million undiscounted and 25 million undiscounted respectively for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates that required us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates follow 

impairment of assets held for use 

we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified we review our longlived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 

manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals primarily platinum and rhodium these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of longlived assets this review considers all of the company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process in reclamation fabrication or refinement in anticipation of reuse or awaiting use to support increased capacity precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other nonmanufacturing related purposes 

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include 

• 

a significant decrease in the market price of an asset 

• 

a significant change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used or in its physical condition 

• 

a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 

• 

an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset 

• 

a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset and 

• 

a current expectation that more likely than not an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for the majority of our reportable segments we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

for longlived assets when impairment indicators are present we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used assessments also consider changes in asset utilization including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 

for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability described above the estimated fair value of longlived assets is determined using an “income approach” “market approach” “cost approach” or a combination of one or more of these approaches as appropriate for the particular asset group being reviewed all of these approaches start with the forecast of expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of longlived assets and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals if appropriate for the asset group being reviewed some of the more significant estimates and assumptions in our analysis include market size and growth market share projected selling prices manufacturing cost and discount rate our estimates are based upon our historical experience our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

corning incorporated – 2012 form 10k 32

in the event the current net book value of an asset group is found to be greater than the net present value of the cash flows derived from the asset group we determine the actual fair market value of longlived assets with the assistance from valuation appraisals conducted by third parties the results of these valuations generally represent the fair market value of the asset group that will remain after any necessary impairment adjustments have been recorded the impairment charge will be allocated to assets within the asset group on a relative fair value basis 

at december 31 2012 the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair value by 28 million at december 31 2011 the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by 304 million in both reporting periods the undiscounted cash flow test shows that these precious metal assets primarily in the display technologies segment are recoverable as part of their asset groupings the potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of our segments such events include but are not limited to a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our display technologies or specialty materials segments 

the specialty materials segment recorded an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2011 in the amount of 130 million related to certain assets used in the production of large cover glass due to sales that were significantly below our expectations in the fourth quarter of 2012 after reassessing the large cover glass business corning concluded that the large cover glass market was developing differently in 2012 than our expectations and demand for largersized cover glass was declining and the market for this type of glass was instead targeting smaller gen size products additionally in the fourth quarter of 2012 our primary customer of large cover glass notified corning of its decision to exit from this display market based on these events we recorded an additional impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the amount of 44 million before tax this impairment charge represents a writedown of assets specific to the glassstrengthening process for large size cover glass to their fair market values and includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process additional information on the asset impairment is found in note 2 restructuring impairment and other charges credits note 9 property net of accumulated depreciation and note 16 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment of goodwill 

we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units 

corning’s goodwill relates primarily to the telecommunications specialty materials and life sciences operating segments on a quarterly basis management performs a qualitative assessment of factors in each reporting unit to determine whether there have been any triggering events the twostep impairment test is required only if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount we perform a detailed twostep process every three years if no indicators suggest a test should be performed in the interim we use this calculation as quantitative validation of the stepzero qualitative process that is performed during the intervening periods and does not represent an election to perform the twostep process in place of the stepzero review 

the following summarizes our qualitative process to assess our goodwill balances for impairment 

• 

we assess qualitative factors in each of our reporting units which carry goodwill to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test 

• 

the following events and circumstances are considered when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 

– 

macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions fluctuations in foreign exchange rates andor other developments in equity and credit markets 

– 

market capital in relation to book value 

– 

industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates material loss in market share and significant declines in product pricing 

– 

cost factors such as an increase in raw materials labor or other costs 

– 

overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or forecasted revenue 

– 

other relevant entityspecific events such as material changes in management or key personnel and 

– 

events affecting a reporting unit such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets including acquisitions and dispositions 

the examples noted above are not allinclusive and the company shall consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test 

our two step goodwill recoverability assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the longterm growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows our valuation method is an “income approach” using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return our estimates are based upon our historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends 

telecommunications 

goodwill for the telecommunications segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level 

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2012 for this reporting unit the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount a discount rate of 9 was used in 2012 we determined a range of discount rates between 7 and 11 would not have affected our conclusion 

specialty materials 

goodwill for the specialty materials segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is one level below an operating segment as goodwill is the result of transactions associated with certain businesses within this operating segment there is only one reporting unit with goodwill within this operating segment 

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2012 for this reporting unit the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount a discount rate of 8 was used in 2012 we determined a range of discount rates between 6 and 10 would not have affected our conclusion additionally the asset impairment which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 did not cause a triggering event for goodwill impairment in this reporting unit because the cash flow related to this lower level asset group is not material to this reporting unit 

corning incorporated – 2012 form 10k 33

life sciences 

goodwill for the life sciences segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level 

in addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2012 for this reporting unit the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount a discount rate of 7 was used in 2012 we determined a range of discount rates between 5 and 9 would not have affected our conclusion 

restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions 

we are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including for example employee termination costs restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses of portions thereof their profitability cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome the judgment involved can be difficult subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses 

restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which as a result require impairment we are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned 

income taxes 

we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environments in which we do business it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances 

equity method investments 

at december 31 2012 and 2011 the carrying value of our equity method investments was 49 billion and 47 billion respectively with our two largest equity method investments comprising approximately 92 of the balance we review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if an event or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be otherthantemporarily impaired when such indicators are present we then perform an indepth review for impairment an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability forecasted tax rates foreign currency exchange rate movements terminal value assumptions historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends 

as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable 

fair value measures 

as required corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the company’s own market assumptions once inputs have been characterized we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement in addition observable market data must be used when available and the highestandbestuse measure should be applied to nonfinancial assets corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are shortterm and longterm investments certain pension asset investments and derivatives these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions 

derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in arriving at the fair value of corning’s derivative assets and liabilities we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction amounts related to credit risk are not material 

the level 3 assets measured with unobservable inputs relate to certain pension asset investments and all longlived assets fair valued on a nonrecurring basis related to the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass resulting in an impairment charge of 44 million refer to note 16 fair value measurements of the consolidated financial statements for further detail 

probability of litigation outcomes 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter case law and other casespecific issues see part ii – item 3 legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face the most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability including the inherent complexity of a chapter 11 filing our history of success in defending asbestos claims our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses and our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants’ representatives the proposed asbestos resolution amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies the approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is not certain and faces objections by some parties any approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is subject to appeal for these and other reasons corning’s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters the estimate of the cost of resolving the nonpcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning’s financial statements is remote 

other possible liabilities 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters including certain tax planning and environmental matters these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 

pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb 

pension and opeb costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates benefits earned interest cost expected return on plan assets mortality rates and other factors actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s employee pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 

corning incorporated – 2012 form 10k 34

back to contents 

as of december 31 2012 the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was 3198 million 

the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans 

 the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning’s funding requirements 

in addition at december 31 2012 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders’ equity by 122 million before tax and a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders’ equity by 119 million in addition the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to corning’s us opeb plans 

 the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned in certain instances revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns allowances discounts and other factors these estimates are supported by historical data while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning’s future results 

sharebased compensation 

sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates sharebased compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects 

• 

exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings and 

• 

exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar which impact our net equity 

we have foreign currency exposure to many currencies including the japanese yen euro new taiwan dollar and korean won we selectively enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with durations generally 18 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases these hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions the objective of these contracts is to reduce the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or corning enter into lending situations generally on an intercompany basis denominated in currencies other than their local currency we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes corning uses derivative instruments forwards to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and as such are referred to as undesignated hedges changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities are recorded in current period earnings in other income net in the consolidated statements of income 

equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations equity in earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments were 810 million and 15 billion in 2012 and 2011 respectively with foreignbased affiliates comprising over 89 of this amount in 2012 equity earnings from samsung corning precision materials totaled 699 million for 2012 and 10 billion for 2011 exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies 

we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2012 with respect to open forward contracts and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 236 million compared to 275 million at december 31 2011 specific to the japanese yen a 10 adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 196 million compared to 241 million at december 31 2011 specific to the euro a 10 adverse movement in quoted euro exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 25 million compared to 23 million at december 31 2011 

as we derive approximately 73 of our net sales from outside the us our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies most notably the japanese yen and euro our forecasts generally assume exchange rates during 2013 remain constant at january 2013 levels as an example of impact changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our financial results we compare 2012 actual sales in yen and euro transaction currencies at an average currency exchange rate during the year to a 10 change in the currency exchange rate a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2012 net sales of approximately 460 million a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2012 net sales of approximately 93 million using 2012 net income attributable to corning incorporated as a percentage of net sales of 22 we can estimate that a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2012 net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately 99 million a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2012 net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately 20 million 

interest rate risk management 

it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2012 our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than 1 of variable rate instruments in the fourth quarter of 2012 we entered into two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of 550 million of previously issued fixed rate longterm debt to floating rate debt under the terms of the swap agreements we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the onemonth libor rate

amanagement’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures and adequate internal control over financial reporting for corning management is also responsible for the assessment of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 

disclosure controls and procedures mean controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms corning’s disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by corning in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to corning’s management including corning’s principal executive and principal financial officers or other persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

any positive trends in the sales of lcd glass substrates in previous years may not continue our customers are lcd panel and color filter makers additionally consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes designs price or other seasonal factors may lead to pauses in market growth from time to time our customers may not be able to maintain their profitability or access sufficient capital to fund routine maintenance and operations or planned expansions which may limit their pace of orders to us emerging material technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications resulting in a decline in demand for our lcd products existing or new production capacity for glass substrates may exceed the demand for them technologies for displays in competition with lcd panels may reduce or eliminate the need for our glass substrates these technologies may include organic light emitting diodes and plasma display panels new process technologies developed by our competitors may also place us at a cost or quality disadvantage our own process technologies may be acquired or used unlawfully by others enabling them to compete with us our inability to manufacture glass substrates in the sizes and quantities needed by our customers may result in loss of revenue margins and profits or liabilities for failure to supply a scarcity of resources limitations on technology personnel or other factors resulting in a failure to produce commercial quantities of very largesize glass substrates could have adverse financial consequences to us 

  

our telecommunications segment customers’ purchases of our products are affected by their capital expansion plans general market and economic uncertainty and regulatory changes including broadband policy sales in the telecommunications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of fibertothepremises deployments by our customers such as bell canada bell aliant nbn co and verizon communications inc our sales will be dependent on planned targets for homes passed and connected changes in our customers’ deployment plans could adversely affect future sales in any quarter or for the full year 

in the environmental technologies segment sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for automotive and diesel emissions are expected to fluctuate with vehicle production changes in laws and regulations for air quality and emission controls may also influence future sales sales in our environmental technologies segment are mainly to three catalyzers and emission system control manufacturers our customers sell these systems to automobile and diesel engine original equipment manufacturers sales in this segment may be affected by adverse developments in the global vehicle or freight hauling industries or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicle sales or downturns in freight traffic 

certain sales in our specialty materials segment track worldwide economic cycles and our customers’ responses to that cycle in addition any positive trends in prior years in the sales of strengthened glass for personal handheld devices and lcd television cover glass may not continue we may experience losses relating to our inability to supply contracted quantities of this glass and processes planned to produce new versions of this glass may not be successful 

sales in our life sciences segment are through two large distributors and the remaining balance is to a variety of government entities pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies hospitals universities and other research facilities in 2011 our two largest distributors accounted for 39 of life sciences’ segment sales changes in our distribution arrangements in this segment may adversely affect this segment’s financial results 

if the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate demand for our products may decline which would negatively impact our operations and financial performance 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies evolving industry or government standards and new product introductions our success is expected to depend in substantial part on the successful introduction of new products or upgrades of current products and our ability to compete with new technologies the following factors related to our products and markets if they do not continue as in the recent past could have an adverse impact on our operations 

 

        we face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely affect our financial performance 

we face pricing pressure in each of our leading businesses as a result of intense competition emerging new technologies or overcapacity while we work consistently toward reducing our costs to offset pricing pressures we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or sustain our current rate of cost reduction we anticipate pricing pressures will continue in the future in all our businesses 

  

we face risks related to our international operations and sales 

we have customers and significant operations including manufacturing and sales located outside the us we have large manufacturing operations for liquid crystal display glass substrates in taiwan china japan and korea including an equity investment in samsung corning precision operating in south korea that makes glass substrates for the korean lcd market all of our display segment customers are located in the asiapacific region as a result of these and other international operations we face a number of risks including 

 

        any of these items could cause our sales or profitability to be significantly reduced 

additionally a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our display technologies segment is concentrated in three overseas countries and it is reasonably possible that the operations of one or more such facilities could be disrupted due to the specialized nature of the assets and the customers’ locations it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from facilities in other countries accordingly loss of these facilities could produce a nearterm severe impact on our display business and the company as a whole 

we face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations 

because we have significant customers and operations outside the us fluctuations in foreign currencies especially the japanese yen new taiwan dollar korean won and euro affect our sales and profit levels foreign exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the us dollar and japanese yen sales in our display technologies segment representing 40 of corning’s sales in 2011 are denominated in japanese yen if sales grow in our display technologies segment our exposure to currency fluctuations will increase corning hedges significant transaction and balance sheet currency exposures and uses derivative instruments to limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities as well as operating results although we selectively hedge these items changes in exchange rates especially the japanese yen to us dollar will significantly impact our reported revenues and profits 

if the financial condition of our customers declines our credit risks could increase 

although we have a rigorous process to administer credit and believe our allowance is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable if our customers or our indirect customers fail to meet their payment obligations for our products we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amounts reserved many customers of our display technologies and specialty materials segments are thinly capitalized andor marginally profitable in our environmental technologies segment the us auto makers and certain of their suppliers have encountered credit downgrades or have filed for bankruptcy protection these factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business 

if we do not successfully adjust our manufacturing volumes and cost structure or achieve manufacturing yields or sufficient product reliability our operating results and cash flow could suffer and we may not achieve anticipated profitability levels 

investments in additional manufacturing capacity of certain businesses including liquid crystal display glass and diesel emission substrates and filters present challenges we may face technical and process issues in moving to commercial production and there can be no assurance that corning will be able to pace its capacity expansion to the actual demand economic results may adversely affect our ability to complete planned capacity expansion and products it is possible that manufacturing capacity may exceed or lag customer demand during certain periods 

  

the manufacturing of our products involves highly complex and precise processes requiring production in highly controlled and dustfree environments changes in our manufacturing processes could significantly reduce our manufacturing yields and product reliability in some cases existing manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the requirements of our customers we will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to achieve targeted volume pricing and cost levels that will permit profitable operations while we continue to fund projects to improve our manufacturing techniques and processes we may not achieve satisfactory cost levels in our manufacturing activities that will fully satisfy our profitability targets 

our future financial performance depends on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials precious metals parts and manufacturing equipment components to meet the demands of our customers 

our ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials precious metals parts and components from our suppliers we may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages there can be no assurances that we will not encounter these problems in the future furthermore certain manufacturing equipment raw materials or components are available only from a single source or limited sources we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner a reduction interruption or delay of supply or a significant increase in the price for supplies such as manufacturing equipment precious metals raw materials or energy could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

we have incurred and may in the future incur restructuring and other charges the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately 

we have recorded several charges for restructuring impairment of assets and the writeoff of cost and equitybased investments in the past in 2011 we recorded a charge for the impairment of certain assets certain of our equity affiliates have also recorded restructuring charges we and our affiliates may have additional actions that result in restructuring charges in the future 

we have incurred and may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 

at december 31 2011 corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of 926 million while we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe or if acquisitions and investments made by the company fail to achieve expected returns 

if our products including materials purchased from our suppliers experience performance issues our business will suffer 

our business depends on the production of products of consistently high quality our products components and materials purchased from our suppliers are typically tested for quality these testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios for various reasons our products including materials purchased from our suppliers may fail to perform as a customer expected in some cases product redesigns or additional expense may be required to address such an issue a significant or systemic product quality issue could result in customer relations problems lost sales and financial damages 

we face competition in most of our businesses 

we expect that we will face continuous competition from existing competitors low cost manufacturers and new entrants we must invest in research and development expand our engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities and continue to improve customer service and support in order to remain competitive we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

  

we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the us and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation may pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow 

changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors some of which are outside of our control including 

 

      in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals 

accounting and disclosure rules may affect financial results 

generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations for many areas of our business such as revenue recognition accounting for investments fair value estimates and accounting for stock options are very complex and involve significant and sometimes subjective judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantly impact our reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures in the future without a corresponding change in our cash flows 

our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees 

the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we are unable to retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution the loss of the services of any of our key research and development engineering or operational personnel or senior management without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance 

we are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations 

various stages of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste waste water and other industrial waste and greenhouse gases and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of such substances we have installed antipollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities we have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations however we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps toward adopting more stringent environment standards 

any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us or the suspensioncessation of production or operations in addition environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the us and other countries such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and co 2 abatement may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by among other things substantially increasing manufacturing costs limiting availability of scarce resources especially energy or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers 

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses we cannot assure you that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property worldwide may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of or the unauthorized use of our intellectual property litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently uncertain and the outcome is often unpredictable other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios 

the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products we are and may in the future be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation that may result in loss of revenue require us to incur substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us we cannot assure you as to the outcome of any such claims 

current or future litigation may harm our financial condition or results of operations 

pending threatened or future litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes expenses and costs exceeding amounts estimated or insured in particular we have been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos and adverse rulings in such lawsuits or the inability to successfully resolve such matters may adversely affect the company as described in legal proceedings an amended pcc plan of reorganization was filed with the bankruptcy court on january 29 2009 proposing a resolution of pcc asbestos claims it remains reasonably possible that changes to the amended pcc plan may be negotiated and the elements of the plan and its approval are subject to a number of contingencies before the resolution outlined in that plan becomes final 

we face risks through our equity method investments in companies that we do not control 

corning’s net income includes significant equity earnings from associated companies for the year ended december 31 2011 we recognized 15 billion of equity earnings of which 98 came from our two largest investments dow corning which makes silicone and high purity polycrystalline products and samsung corning precision which primarily makes liquid crystal display glass samsung corning precision is located in the asiapacific region and is subject to political and geographic risks mentioned above as well as business and other risks within the display technologies segment our equity investments may not continue to perform at the same levels as in recent years in 2007 we recognized equity losses associated with samsung corning co ltd a 50 equity method investment that made glass panels and funnels for conventional televisions which recorded fixed asset and other impairment charges dow corning emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2004 and has certain obligations under its plan of reorganization to resolve and fund claims of its creditors and personal injury claimants dow corning may incur further bankruptcy charges in the future which may adversely affect its operations or assets 

we may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us 

we face the risk of loss resulting from product liability securities fiduciary liability intellectual property antitrust contractual warranty environmental fraud and other lawsuits whether or not such claims are valid in addition our product liability fiduciary directors and officers property including business interruption natural catastrophe and comprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect in the future our insurance costs can be volatile and at any time can increase given changes in market supply and demand and our claim history we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs a successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us to pay substantial sums some of the carriers in our historical primary and excess insurance programs are in liquidation and may not be able to respond if we should have claims reaching their policies the financial health of other insurers may deteriorate several of our insurance carriers are litigating with us the extent if any of their obligation to provide insurance coverage for asbestos liabilities asserted against us the results of that litigation may adversely affect our insurance coverage for those risks in addition we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain types of risk such as political risks terrorism or war 

  

our businesses may be subject to increased regulatory enforcement 

some of our reportable segments operate in industries with a concentrated number of competitors and customers both foreign and domestic while we have adopted a corporatewide compliance program we may become the subject of antitrust or other governmental investigations from many jurisdictions that may adversely impact our reputation or our ability to make and sell products in the future 

acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business 

we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we don’t realize a satisfactory return on our investment or that we experience difficulty integrating new employees business systems and technology or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or market share or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized these events could harm our operating results or financial condition 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation 

we store and process personally identifiable information of our employees and in some cases our customers at the same time the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to breaches of information security this environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies despite these efforts it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our investments 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that have affected global financial markets a significant part of our investment portfolio consists of us government securities if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline or if the us federal government budget process results in a default or downgrade of its debt our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely impact our financial results 

security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue liability claims or competitive harm 

we use electronic information technology it in our manufacturing processes and operations and other aspects of our business despite our implementation of security measures our it systems are vulnerable to disruptions from computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized access cyber attack and other similar disruptions a material breach in the security of our it systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets to the extent that any disruptions or security breaches result in the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information it could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business 

additionally utilities and other operators of critical energy infrastructure that serve our facilities may face heightened security risks including cyber attacks in the event of such an attack disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power electrical gas etc

 item 2 properties 

we operate over 80 manufacturing plants and processing facilities of which approximately onethird are located in the us we own substantially all of our executive and corporate buildings which are located in corning new york we also own approximately 90 of our research and development facilities and the majority of our manufacturing facilities we own approximately 22 of our sales and administrative facilities while the remaining facilities are leased 

for the years ended 2011 2010 and 2009 we invested a total of 43 billion primarily in facilities outside of the us in our display technologies segment of the 24 billion spent in 2011 over 10 billion was for facilities outside the us 

manufacturing sales and administrative and research and development facilities have an aggregate floor space of approximately 25 million square feet distribution of this total area follows 

 

 total assets and capital expenditures by operating segment are included in note 20 reportable segments to the consolidated financial statements information concerning lease commitments is included in note 14 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 as a result of excess glass capacity in the market we announced plans to reduce worldwide glass capacity in our specialty materials and display technologies segments by approximately 25 these actions impact corning gorilla glass capacity and lcd glass manufacturing capacity at both our whollyowned lcd glass business and at our equity affiliate samsung corning precision and include delaying the start up of the new tanks as well as postponing the relight of tanks that were under repair samsung corning precision also shut down several active tanks additionally corning recorded an impairment charge in the amount of 130 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to certain assets located in japan used in the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass the large cover glass impairment charge represents a writedown of assets specific to the glassstrengthening process for large size cover glass to their relative fair market values as of the date of impairment this asset group includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process and facilities dedicated to the ion exchange process refer to note 9 property net of accumulated depreciation and note 16 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

environmental litigation corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 18 hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by the agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2011 and 2010 corning had accrued approximately 25 million undiscounted and 30 million undiscounted respectively for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 

  

dow corning corporation  corning and the dow chemical company dow chemical each own 50 of the common stock of dow corning in may 1995 dow corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousands of breast implant product lawsuits on june 1 2004 dow corning emerged from chapter 11 with a plan of reorganization the plan which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims the plan also includes releases for corning and dow chemical as shareholders in exchange for contributions to the plan 

under the terms of the plan dow corning has established and is funding a settlement trust and a litigation facility to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate their claims inclusive of insurance dow corning has paid approximately 17 billion to the settlement trust as of december 31 2011 dow corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of 16 billion as a separate matter arising from the bankruptcy proceedings dow corning is defending claims asserted by a number of commercial creditors who claim additional interest at default rates and enforcement costs during the period from may 1995 through june 2004 as of december 31 2011 dow corning has estimated the liability to commercial creditors to be within the range of 86 million to 280 million as dow corning management believes no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range dow corning has recorded the minimum liability within the range should dow corning not prevail in this matter corning’s equity earnings would be reduced by its 50 share of the amount in excess of 86 million net of applicable tax benefits in addition the london market insurers the lmi claimants claimed a reimbursement right with respect to a portion of insurance proceeds previously paid by the lmi claimants to dow corning this claim was based on a theory that the lmi claimants overestimated dow corning’s liability for the resolution of implant claims pursuant to the plan based on settlement negotiations dow corning had estimated that the most likely outcome would result in payment to the lmi claimants in a range of 10 million to 20 million during the third quarter dow corning and the lmi claimants settled the claim for an amount within that range there are a number of other claims in the bankruptcy proceedings against dow corning awaiting resolution by the us district court and it is reasonably possible that dow corning may record bankruptcyrelated charges in the future the remaining tort claims against corning are expected to be channeled by the plan into facilities established by the plan or otherwise defended by the litigation facility 

hemlock semiconductor group of which dow corning owns 63 brought an action against one of its customers to enforce multiyear supply agreements requiring the customer to purchase or pay for quantities of polycrystalline silicon used in the solar power industry hemlock semiconductor group and the customer resolved the dispute during the fourth quarter the settlement resulted in dow corning recognizing pretax income of approximately 420 million for the year ended december 31 2011 including previously deferred revenue after income taxes and amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to dow corning for the year ended december 31 2011 increased by approximately 177 million from this settlement 

pittsburgh corning corporation corning and ppg industries inc ppg each own 50 of the capital stock of pittsburgh corning corporation pcc over a period of more than two decades pcc and several other defendants have been named in numerous lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos on april 16 2000 pcc filed for chapter 11 reorganization in the us bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania at the time pcc filed for bankruptcy protection there were approximately 11800 claims pending against corning in state court lawsuits alleging various theories of liability based on exposure to pcc’s asbestos products and typically requesting monetary damages in excess of one million dollars per claim corning has defended those claims on the basis of the separate corporate status of pcc and the absence of any facts supporting claims of direct liability arising from pcc’s asbestos products corning is also currently involved in approximately 9900 other cases approximately 38300 claims alleging injuries from asbestos and similar amounts of monetary damages per case those cases have been covered by insurance without material impact to corning to date as described below several of corning’s insurance carriers have filed a legal proceeding concerning the extent of any insurance coverage for these claims asbestos litigation is inherently difficult and past trends in resolving these claims may not be indicators of future outcomes 

corning with other relevant parties has been involved in ongoing efforts to develop a plan of reorganization that would resolve the concerns and objections of the relevant courts and parties in 2003 a plan was agreed to by various parties the 2003 plan but on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court issued an order denying the confirmation of that 2003 plan on january 29 2009 an amended plan of reorganization the amended pcc plan  which addressed the issues raised by the court when it denied confirmation of the 2003 plan  was filed with the bankruptcy court 

  

the proposed resolution of pcc asbestos claims under the amended pcc plan would have required corning to contribute its equity interests in pcc and pittsburgh corning europe nv pce a belgian corporation and to contribute a fixed series of payments recorded at present value corning would have had the option to use its shares rather than cash to make these payments but the liability would have been fixed by dollar value and not the number of shares the amended pcc plan would originally have required corning to make 1 one payment of 100 million one year from the date the amended pcc plan becomes effective and certain conditions are met and 2 five additional payments of 50 million on each of the five subsequent anniversaries of the first payment the final payment of which is subject to reduction based on the application of credits under certain circumstances documents were filed with the bankruptcy court further modifying the amended pcc plan by reducing corning’s initial payment by 30 million and reducing its second and fourth payments by 15 million each in return corning would relinquish its claim for reimbursement of its payments and contributions under the amended pcc plan from the insurance carriers involved in the bankruptcy proceeding with certain exceptions 

on june 16 2011 the court entered an order denying confirmation of the amended pcc plan the court’s memorandum opinion accompanying the order rejected some objections to the amended pcc plan and made suggestions regarding modifications to the amended pcc plan that would allow the plan to be confirmed corning and other parties have filed a motion for reconsideration objecting to certain points of this order certain parties to the proceeding filed specific plan modifications in response to the court’s opinion and corning supported these filings corning and other parties also filed a motion for reconsideration objecting to certain points in the court’s opinion and order proposed plan modifications will be discussed during the hearing scheduled for february 17 2012 

the amended pcc plan does not include certain nonpcc asbestos claims that may be or have been raised against corning corning has recorded an additional 150 million for such claims in its estimated asbestos litigation liability the liability for nonpcc claims was estimated based upon industry data for asbestos claims since corning does not have recent claim history due to the injunction issued by the bankruptcy court the estimated liability represents the undiscounted projection of claims and related legal fees over the next 20 years the amount may need to be adjusted in future periods as more data becomes available 

the amended pcc plan with the modifications addressing issues raised by the court’s june 16 opinion remains subject to a number of contingencies payment of the amounts required to fund the amended pcc plan from insurance and other sources are subject to a number of conditions that may not be achieved the approval of the further modified amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is not certain and faces objections by some parties if the modified amended pcc plan is approved by the bankruptcy court that approval will be subject to appeal for these and other reasons corning’s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters the estimate of the cost of resolving the nonpcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning’s financial statements is remote 

several of corning’s insurers have commenced litigation in state courts for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies including rights that may be affected by the potential resolutions described above corning is vigorously contesting these cases management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation and therefore cannot estimate the range of any possible loss

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

organization of information 

management’s discussion and analysis provides a historical and prospective narrative on the company’s financial condition and results of operations this discussion includes the following sections 

 

        overview 

although corning’s net income declined in 2011 when compared to 2010 the majority of our segments experienced healthy sales growth despite the challenging 2011 economic environment the largest driver of corning’s sales increase was the robust retail demand for portable display devices that utilize our corning gorilla glass our telecommunications segment also experienced significant sales growth in 2011 due to strong fibertothepremises enterprise network products and optical fiber and cable sales in addition sales increased 22 in 2011 in our environmental technologies segment reflecting increased demand worldwide for automotive and diesel products sales in the life sciences segment were higher primarily due to an increase in demand for the segment’s legacy products combined with the impact of a small acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2010 sales in our display technologies segment were only slightly higher in 2011 when compared to the prior year reflecting volume growth and favorable movements in foreign exchange rates offset by significantly lower prices results in this segment reflect the excess glass capacity in the market driven by lower than anticipated worldwide glass volume growth in 2011 corning is addressing the current imbalance between glass supply and demand by reducing worldwide glass capacity in our display technologies and specialty materials segments by approximately 25 impacting lcd glass capacity as well as corning gorilla glass capacity 

for the year ended december 31 2011 we generated net income of 28 billion or 177 per share compared to net income of 36 billion or 225 per share for 2010 when compared to last year the decrease in net income was due largely to the following items 

 

       the decrease in net income in 2011 was offset somewhat from the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates in the amount of 219 million and higher net income in our telecommunications and environmental technologies segments 

  

corning remains committed to a strategy of growing through global innovation while preserving our independence this strategy has served us well our key priorities for 2011 were similar to those in prior years protect our financial health and invest in the future during 2011 we made the following progress on these priorities 

financial health 

our financial position remained sound and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities significant items in 2011 included the following 

 

     investing in our future 

we continue to focus on the future and on what we do best – creating keystone components that enable hightechnology systems we remain committed to investing in research development and engineering to drive innovation we continue to work on new products including glass substrates for high performance displays oled and lcd applications diesel filters and substrates and the optical fiber cable and hardware and equipment that enable fibertothepremises and next generation data centers in addition in 2011 we increased our focused on wireless solutions for diverse venue applications such as distributed antenna systems fibertothecell and antennas we have increased our research development and engineering spending to support the advancement of new product attributes for our corning gorilla glass suite of products we will continue to focus on adjacent glass opportunities including products such as glass substrates for thinfilm photovoltaics in solar applications which leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes 

our research development and engineering expenditures increased by 68 million in 2011 when compared to 2010 but remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales we believe our spending levels are appropriate to support our technology and innovation strategies 

capital spending increased significantly in 2011 when compared to 2010 largely as a result of several multiyear investment plans announced in 2010 that will increase manufacturing capacity in several of our reportable segments specifically the increase in spending in 2011 was driven by construction costs for an lcd glass substrate facility in china for our display technologies segment and a capacity expansion project for specialty materials’ corning gorilla glass in japan capital expenditures in 2011 also include spending in the environmental technologies segment to expand its existing automotive substrate facilities in shanghai china and kaiserslautern germany and in the life sciences segment to establish a manufacturing and distribution facility in wujiang china total capital expenditures for 2011 were 24 billion in 2011 approximately 13 billion was invested in our display technologies segment and approximately 348 million was invested in our specialty materials segment 

we expect our 2012 capital spending to be about 18 billion approximately 800 million will be allocated to our display technologies segment of which approximately 400 million will be related to 2011 capital projects 

  

corporate outlook 

corning expects moderate sales growth in 2012 led by an increase in demand in our telecommunications and environmental technologies segments we believe worldwide demand for lcd glass in 2012 will increase from 32 billion square feet to approximately 36 billion square feet when compared to 2011 driven by the combination of an increase in retail sales of lcd televisions and the demand for larger television screen sizes coupled with growth in the personal computer market we expect cumulative doubledigit price declines in our display segment over the twoquarter period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011 we are hopeful that sequential quarterly price declines in 2012 will be moderate net income will be negatively impacted by lower equity earnings from our equity affiliate dow corning driven by lower demand and price declines in both silicone products and at hemlock semiconductor group dow corning’s consolidated subsidiary that makes high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries we may take advantage of acquisition opportunities that support the longterm strategies of our businesses we remain confident that our strategy to grow through global innovation while preserving our financial stability will enable our continued longterm success 

results of operations 

selected highlights from our continuing operations follow dollars in millions 

 

  

   

net sales 

net sales in 2011 increased 19 when compared to the prior year due to sales growth in all of our segments with the largest increases occurring in the specialty materials telecommunications and environmental segments sales in the specialty materials segment increased by 86 due to the strong demand for corning gorilla glass that is used as cover glass in portable handheld display devices tablets and notebook computers telecommunications segment sales increased due to strength across all of their product lines most significantly in optical fiber and cable and fibertothepremises products sales in the environmental technologies segment were higher driven by higher demand for our diesel products additionally the net positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates impacted sales in the amount of 345 million 

net sales in 2010 increased 23 due to higher sales in all of our segments when compared to 2009 driven by volume growth in all of our segments and from the net positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates we saw demand increase for all of our lcd products led by strong growth of lcd televisions outside of the united states sales in our specialty materials segment in 2010 increased 75 when compared to 2009 due to strong demand for corning gorilla glass products sales were also strong in both our environmental technologies and life sciences segments up 38 and 39 respectively 

in 2011 net sales into international markets accounted for 78 of net sales for 2010 and 2009 net sales into international markets accounted for 74 and 76 respectively of net sales 

cost of sales 

the types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are raw materials consumption including direct and indirect materials salaries wages and benefits depreciation and amortization production utilities productionrelated purchasing warehousing including receiving and inspection repairs and maintenance interlocation inventory transfer costs production and warehousing facility property insurance rent for production facilities and other production overhead 

gross margin 

for 2011 gross margin dollars increased when compared to 2010 but declined slightly as a percentage of sales improvements in gross margin were driven by the impact of strong sales in the specialty materials segment along with volume increases and manufacturing efficiency gains in the environmental technologies segment offsetting these gains was the impact of significant price declines in our display technologies segment 

for 2010 gross margin dollars and as a percentage of net sales increased significantly when compared to 2009 due primarily to the impact of volume increases in the display technologies segment offset somewhat by price declines improvements were also driven by strong sales in the environmental technologies and specialty materials segments as well as cost reduction efforts and manufacturing efficiency improvements 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2011 increased slightly when compared to 2010 due primarily to an increase in salaries partially as a result of three small acquisitions completed within the past 15 months offset by an adjustment to performancebased compensation costs and a credit of 27 million resulting from a reduction in a contingent liability associated with an acquisition recorded in the first quarter of 2011 as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses in 2011 were down considerably when compared to 2010 because the rate of increase in sales exceeded the rate of increase in spending for selling general and administrative costs 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2010 were up when compared to 2009 due primarily to higher compensationrelated costs and the costs of integrating new businesses offset by the impact of restructuring actions completed in 2009 as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses in 2010 were down slightly when compared to 2009 because the rate of increase in sales exceeded the rate of increase in spending for selling general and administrative costs 

the types of expenses included in the selling general and administrative expenses line item are salaries wages and benefits travel sales commissions professional fees and depreciation and amortization utilities and rent for administrative facilities 

  

research development and engineering expenses 

research development and engineering expenses for 2011 increased by 68 million to 671 million in 2011 when compared to 2010 but remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales corning’s research development and engineering expenses are currently focused on our specialty materials and telecommunications segments as we strive to capitalize on growth opportunities in those segments we believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies 

research development and engineering expenses increased by 40 million in 2010 when compared to 2009 but declined slightly as a percentage of net sales increased spending in 2010 was driven primarily by the display technologies environmental technologies and telecommunications segments 

restructuring impairment and other charges and credits 

corning recorded restructuring impairment and other charges and credits in 2011 2010 and 2009 which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented a description of those charges and credits follows 

2011 activity 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 corning recorded an impairment charge in the amount of 130 million related to certain assets located in japan used in the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass large cover glass is primarily used as a cover sheet of strengthened glass for frameless bezelless lcd displays the large cover glass impairment charge represents a writedown of assets specific to the glassstrengthening process for large size cover glass to their relative fair market values as of the date of impairment this asset group includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process and facilities dedicated to the ion exchange process additional information on the asset impairment is found in note 9 property net of accumulated depreciation and note 16 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements 

2010 activity 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded 324 million in other credits as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims resulting from two events which impacted production at several of our lcd glass manufacturing facilities in august 2009 an earthquake halted production at one of our lcd glass manufacturing facilities in japan and in october 2009 production at our facility in taichung taiwan was impacted by a power disruption 

2009 activity 

in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009 we recorded charges of 228 million primarily for a corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce the charges included costs for severance special termination benefits outplacement services and the impact of a 32 million curtailment loss for postretirement benefits in 2009 total cash expenditures associated with these actions were approximately 150 million with the majority of spending for employeerelated costs completed by 2010 and payments for exit activities substantially completed by the end of 2011 annualized savings from these actions are about 224 million and are reflected largely in cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses 

asbestos litigation 

in 2011 we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of 24 million compared to a net decrease in 2010 of 49 million the net decrease in 2010 was due primarily to a 54 million decrease to our estimated liability for asbestos litigation that was recorded in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the change in terms of the proposed settlement of the pcc asbestos claims for the remainder of 2010 we recorded net credit adjustments to our asbestos litigation liability of 5 million to reflect the change in value of the estimated settlement liability in 2009 we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of 20 million 

our asbestos litigation liability was estimated to be 657 million at december 31 2011 compared with an estimate of 633 million at december 31 2010 the entire obligation is classified as a noncurrent liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than 12 months after the proposed amended pcc plan is ultimately effective and a portion of the obligation fulfilled through the direct contribution of corning’s investment in pce currently recorded as a noncurrent other equity method investment

equity in earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments 

the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments in millions 

 

 equity earnings of affiliated companies decreased in 2011 reflecting lower earnings performance at both samsung corning precision and at dow corning when compared to last year 

the change in equity earnings from samsung corning precision is explained more fully in the discussion of the performance of the display technologies segment and in all other 

equity earnings from dow corning were lower in 2011 when compared to 2010 the decline in equity earnings was largely due to the following items 

 

   the decrease in equity earnings from dow corning was partially offset by a gain in the amount of 89 million associated with the resolution of a contract dispute by dow corning’s consolidated subsidiary hemlock semiconductor group hemlock a producer of high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries against one of its customers relating to enforcement of longterm supply agreements 

in the second half of 2011 dow corning began experiencing unfavorable industry conditions at hemlock declines in governmental subsidies in the solar panel industry especially in europe and overcapacity at all levels of the solar supply chain led to significant declines in polycrystalline spot prices the decline in spot prices was large enough to potentially induce hemlock customers to default on their long term contracts in response hemlock modified a number of sales agreements to provide temporary pricing relief while preserving the longterm favorable relationships with its customers in addition hemlock decided to delay certain plant expansion activities until market conditions for polycrystalline silicon have improved prices for polycrystalline silicon are expected to remain at these substantially lower levels throughout 2012 negatively impacting profitability at hemlock and resulting in lower equity earnings from dow corning in 2012 when compared to 2011 

the increase in equity earnings from dow corning in 2010 when compared to 2009 was primarily due to the following items 

 

      

other income expense net 

“other income expense net” in corning’s consolidated statements of income includes the following in millions 

 

 income before income taxes 

in addition to the items identified under gross margin restructuring impairment and other charges credits asbestos litigation charge credit and other income net movements in foreign exchange rates also impacted results for the years presented in 2011 income before income taxes included 256 million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2010 in 2010 income before income taxes included 229 million for the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the previous year 

provision benefit for income taxes 

our provision benefit for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows in millions 

 

 the effective income tax rate for 2011 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

 

    the effective income tax rate for 2010 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

 

     the effective income tax rate benefit for 2009 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

 

        

corning has valuation allowances on certain shorterlived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss carry forwards and state tax net operating loss carry forwards as well as other foreign net operating loss carry forwards and federal and state tax credits because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire us profits of approximately 78 billion will be required to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of december 31 2011 of that amount 42 billion of us profits will be required over the next 14 years to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with federal net operating loss carry forwards the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized as the underlying temporary differences reverse over an extended period the amount of us and foreign deferred tax assets that had valuation allowances at december 31 2011 and 2010 was 219 million and 214 million respectively 

we currently provide income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies to the extent these earnings are currently taxable or expected to be remitted as of december 31 2011 taxes have not been provided on approximately 108 billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings that are expected to remain invested indefinitely it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings 

certain foreign subsidiaries in china and taiwan are operating under tax holiday arrangements the nature and extent of such arrangements vary and the benefits of such arrangements phase out through 2015 according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 20 31 and 73 percentage points for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

while we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next 12 months we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position 

refer to note 6 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding income tax matters 

net income attributable to corning incorporated 

as a result of the items discussed above net income and per share data was as follows in millions except per share amounts 

 

 reportable segments 

our reportable segments are as follows 

 

     all other reportable segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “all other” this group is primarily comprised of development projects and results for new product lines 

  

we prepared the financial results for our segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions we included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment’s net income we have allocated certain common expenses among our reportable segments differently than we would for standalone financial information segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements 

effective january 1 2009 we began providing us income tax expense or benefit on us earnings losses due to the change in our conclusion about the realizability of our us deferred tax assets in 2008 as a result of the change in our tax position we adjusted the allocation of taxes to our reportable segments in 2009 to reflect this difference the impact of changing our allocation methodology was not significant 

display technologies 

dollars in millions 

 

 2011 vs 2010 

the end market for lcd televisions was up slightly with unit growth rates remaining consistent with or exceeding our expectations across all geographic regions additionally largersized lcd televisions were the fastest growing size category in 2011 and have resulted in area growth rates that were even higher than unit growth rates however because corning sells to panel makers and not to end market consumers supply chain expansion and contraction for this industry are key factors in corning’s sales volume while end market demand continues to grow in all lcd applications inventory levels within the lcd supply chain have not kept pace with this growth and have in fact declined in absolute terms during 2011 when compared to 2010 resulting in lower volume and excess capacity in the supply chain as a result corning announced in the fourth quarter of 2011 that it would reduce capacity at our whollyowned business by delaying the startup of new glass melting tanks as well as postponing the relight of tanks that were removed from service for normal repair our equity affiliate samsung corning precision took similar actions in the fourth quarter of 2011 

the slight increase in net sales in the display technologies segment in 2011 compared to 2010 was driven primarily by the favorable impact of approximately 300 million from movements in foreign exchange rates net sales of this segment are denominated in japanese yen and as a result are susceptible to movements in the us dollarjapanese yen exchange rate volume growth in 2011 was more than offset by price declines when compared to 2010 

when compared to 2010 the decrease in equity earnings from samsung corning precision in 2011 reflected volume and price declines offset somewhat by the favorable impact of approximately 120 million from movements in foreign exchange rates equity earnings of samsung corning precision are impacted by movements in both the us dollar  japanese yen and us dollar  korean won exchange rates the impact of the supply chain contraction and excess capacity has been more severe in korea resulting in higher price and volume declines at samsung corning precision than at our whollyowned business additionally in the fourth quarter of 2011 although samsung corning precision significantly reduced its glass pricing in light of the current state of glass supply in the industry it did not recover market share that was lost in the third quarter due to these market dynamics samsung corning precision reduced its glass melting capacity as described above equity earnings were also negatively impacted by higher taxes due to the partial expiration of a korean tax holiday and the absence of a 61 million credit for our share of a revised tax holiday calculation agreed to by the korean national tax service recorded in 2010 

when compared to 2010 the decrease in net income in the display technologies segment in 2011 reflects the impact of lower equity earnings price declines and a decrease in royalty income partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiency and the favorable impact of approximately 230 million from foreign exchange rate movements net income was also negatively impacted by the absence of a pretax credit recorded in 2010 in the amount of 324 million as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims 

  

a number of corning’s patents and knowhow are licensed to samsung corning precision as well as to third parties which generates royalty income royalty income from samsung corning precision decreased in 2011 when compared to 2010 reflecting the decline in sales volume at samsung corning precision corning and samsung corning precision have agreed that for a fiveyear period commencing december 1 2011 the applicable royalty rate will be reduced by approximately 50 compared to the prior five years refer to note 7 investments to the consolidated financial statements for more information about related party transactions 

2010 vs 2009 

the increase in net sales in 2010 when compared to 2009 reflected an increase in volume of more than 25 and the positive impact of 179 million from movements in foreign exchange rates offset by price declines of 8 volume gains in 2010 were led by strong growth in demand for lcd televisions outside of the united states coupled with a replenishment of this industry’s supply chain 

equity earnings of samsung corning precision in 2010 increased by 32 when compared to 2009 due to volume gains of almost 20 improved manufacturing performance and by the positive impact of 90 million from movements in foreign exchange rates offset somewhat by price declines of 7 equity earnings of samsung corning precision are impacted by movements in both the us dollar  japanese yen and us dollar  korean won exchange rates equity earnings were also positively impacted by a 61 million credit for our share of a revised samsung corning precision tax holiday calculation agreed to by the korean national tax service 

when compared to 2009 the increase in net income in 2010 primarily reflects the impact of the volume increases described above at both our whollyowned business and samsung corning precision and the impact of an insurance settlement for business interruption and property damage insurance claims partially offset by price declines the insurance settlement relates to two events in 2009 which impacted production at our lcd glass manufacturing facilities in august 2009 an earthquake halted production at one of our lcd glass manufacturing facilities in japan and in october 2009 production at our facility in taichung taiwan was impacted by a power disruption we recorded a pretax credit in 2010 in the amount of 324 million as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims related to these two events results also improved due to the absence of 31 million of restructuring charges impacting 2009 net income net income included royalty income from samsung corning precision that was higher in 2010 when compared to 2009 reflecting the improvements in sales volume at samsung corning precision net income in 2010 also includes the favorable impact of 182 million from movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2009 

other information 

the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan china and taiwan in 2011 four customers of the display technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for a combined 77 of total segment sales for 2010 and 2009 three customers of the display technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for 72 and 62 respectively of total segment sales when totaled our customers face the same global economic dynamics as we do in this market while we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues our nearterm sales and profitability would be impacted if any of these significant customers were unable to continue to purchase our products 

in addition samsung corning precision’s sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers in 2011 2010 and 2009 sales to two lcd panel makers located in korea accounted for approximately 93 of samsung corning precision sales in each of those three years 

corning has invested heavily to expand capacity to meet the projected demand for lcd glass substrates in 2011 2010 and 2009 capital spending in this segment was 13 billion 497 million and 552 million respectively we expect capital spending for 2012 to be approximately 800 million of which approximately 400 million will be related to spending from 2011 capital projects 

in 2005 and 2004 several of corning’s customers entered into longterm purchase and supply agreements in which corning’s display technologies segment would supply largesize glass substrates to these customers over periods of up to six years as part of the agreements these customers agreed to advance cash deposits to corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased we received our last deposit of 105 million in july 2007 and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements during 2011 2010 and 2009 we issued 28 million 83 million and 253 million respectively in credits that were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due as of december 31 2011 no additional deposits have been received and all amounts previously owed as credits have been applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due refer to note 11 other liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

outlook 

we expect the overall lcd glass retail market to increase from 32 billion square feet in 2011 to approximately 36 billion square feet in 2012 we believe that the longterm market drivers will be lcd television growth driven by growth of largersized lcd televisions and increased demand in emerging regions as well as continued growth in the personal computer market 

in the first quarter of 2012 we expect volume at our whollyowned business to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2011 we anticipate volume at samsung corning precision to be flat to down in the doubledigits depending upon the outcome of negotiations with a key customer when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 we expect cumulative doubledigit price declines over the twoquarter period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011 

the end market demand for lcd televisions monitors and notebooks is dependent on consumer retail spending among other things we are cautious about the potential negative impacts that economic conditions particularly a global economic recession excess market capacity and world political tensions could have on consumer demand while the industry has grown rapidly in recent years economic volatility along with consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes prices or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth therefore it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time we may incur further charges in this segment to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity in addition changes in foreign exchange rates principally the japanese yen will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment 

telecommunications 

dollars in millions 

 

 2011 vs 2010 

in 2011 net sales of the telecommunications segment increased when compared to 2010 due to higher sales in all of the segment’s product lines led by fibertothepremises optical fiber and cable and enterprise network products sales of fibertothepremises products increased 39 driven by initiatives in canada europe and australia optical fiber and cable sales growth reflected record volume moderating price declines and an increase in sales of premium products sales also increased due to a small acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2011 and the positive impact from movements in foreign exchange rates in the amount of 20 million 

the increase in net income in 2011 when compared to 2010 reflects higher volume across all product lines and an increase in sales of higher margin products coupled with a credit in the amount of 27 million for the decrease in a contingent liability associated with a first quarter acquisition the increase in net income was offset slightly by the impact of higher raw materials and project costs associated with our initiatives in australia and europe movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of net income for the periods presented 

the telecommunications segment has a concentrated customer base in 2011 one customer of the telecommunications segment accounted for 12 of total segment net sales in 2010 one customer of the telecommunications segment accounted for 15 of total segment net sales in 2009 one customer of the telecommunications segment accounted for 12 of total segment net sales 

2010 vs 2009 

net sales for the segment were up when compared to 2009 higher sales of enterprise network products and optical fiber and cable in north america and europe were offset somewhat by lower sales of fibertothepremises products and optical fiber and cable products in asia as well as the absence of sales from two businesses sold in 2009 sales from the two businesses sold totaled 49 million net sales in 2010 were negatively impacted by 11 million from movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2009 

  

the increase in net income in 2010 reflected the absence of restructuring charges from 2009 volume strength in enterprise network products and the impact of improved manufacturing efficiency and cost reduction efforts net income of this segment in 2009 included 42 million of restructuring charges associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce net income in 2010 includes the favorable impact of 10 million from movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2009 

outlook 

we expect another strong year of sales growth in the telecommunications segment in 2012 driven by an increase in global demand for our optical fiber and cable fibertothepremises and enterprise network products in the first quarter of 2012 we expect net sales of this segment to increase between 5 and 10 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 

changes in our customers’ expected deployment plans or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fibertothepremises products could also affect sales levels should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated our sales and earnings would be adversely affected 

environmental technologies 

dollars in millions 

 

  

 2011 vs 2010 

when compared to 2010 net sales in the environmental technologies segment increased in 2011 primarily due to higher sales of diesel products the increase was driven by an increase in truck production in the united states implementation of european governmental regulations on light duty diesel vehicles and the first stages of the implementation of offroad vehicle regulations in the united states sales of our automotive products also increased slightly in 2011 when compared to 2010 reflecting the continuing growth of worldwide automotive production net sales of this segment in 2011 were positively impacted by 13 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2010 

net income in 2011 increased 181 when compared to 2010 due to higher sales volume for our diesel products combined with reduced air freight expense and improved manufacturing performance in both diesel and automotive product lines the increase in net income was slightly offset by higher depreciation and project costs on manufacturing capacity expansion movements in foreign exchange rates negatively impacted the results of this segment in the amount of 3 million when compared to 2010 

the environmental technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of catalyzer and emission control systems manufacturers who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers the use of our substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel vehicle or engine manufacturers for 2011 three customers of the environmental technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment sales accounted for 85 of total segment sales for 2010 three customers of the environmental technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment sales accounted for 86 of total segment sales for 2009 net sales to those same three customers accounted for 85 of total segment sales while we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues with our direct customers our nearterm sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products 

  

2010 vs 2009 

net sales for the environmental technologies segment in 2010 were up 38 when compared to 2009 and reflected higher volumes of both automotive and diesel products offset somewhat by unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements in 2009 automotive vehicle sales declined with the worldwide recession and production was significantly below vehicle sales volumes as manufacturers and dealers decreased inventories in 2010 as automotive markets in the united states and europe improved and china continued to expand manufacturers and dealers increased inventories and production levels resulting in a 25 increase in automotive production when compared to 2009 diesel product sales increased 54 reflecting an improvement in the truck market in the united states and implementation of governmental regulations in europe net sales of this segment in 2010 were negatively impacted by 11 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2009 

net income in 2010 increased due to higher sales volumes and improvements in manufacturing performance offset somewhat by higher freight costs when compared to 2009 net income in 2010 also reflected the absence of restructuring charges in comparison to the previous year in 2009 net loss of this segment included 28 million of restructuring charges associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009 net income in 2010 included the negative impact of 9 million from movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2009 

outlook 

we expect net sales of this segment to continue to be strong in 2012 due to strong growth in demand for diesel products in the united states freight market and related truck production and continued implementation of governmental regulations of nonroad regulations in the united states and europe in the first quarter of 2012 we expect net sales of this segment to be up slightly when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 

specialty materials 

dollars in millions 

 

  

 2011 vs 2010 

the specialty materials segment manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs consequently this segment operates in a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets that include display optics and components semiconductor optics components aerospace and defense astronomy ophthalmic products telecommunications components and a protective cover glass that is optimized for portable display devices and televisions 

net sales in 2011 increased significantly in the specialty materials segment driven by sales of corning gorilla glass which more than doubled when compared to last year and a modest increase in semiconductor optics and aerospace and defense products movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales of this segment in 2011 sales of corning gorilla glass increased considerably especially during the first nine months of the year due to a combination of strong retail demand for handheld display devices tablets and notebook computers and increased usage of our glass on these devices although sales of corning gorilla glass used in our large cover glass products increased in 2011 when compared to 2010 sales were significantly below our expectations in 2011 and are expected to be lower than forecasted in 2012 as a result certain assets located in japan used in the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass were impaired in the fourth quarter of 2011 this asset group includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process and facilities dedicated to the ion exchange process the specialty materials segment reduced capacity for its corning gorilla glass products including the impairment of large cover glass assets in the fourth quarter of 2011 as part of corning’s worldwide capacity reduction of approximately 25 

the slight increase in net loss in 2011 when compared to 2010 was driven by the large cover glass asset impairment charge in the amount of 130 million pretax offset by the considerable increase in sales volume of our corning gorilla glass used in handheld display devices tablets and notebook computers net income was also impacted somewhat by declines in manufacturing efficiency caused primarily by startup costs for large cover glass and glass tank conversions necessary to increase manufacturing capacity for corning gorilla glass in 2011 as well as the negative impact of movements in foreign exchange rates in the amount of 22 million 

  

for 2011 two customers of the specialty materials segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment sales accounted for 42 of total segment sales for 2010 three customers of the specialty materials segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment sales accounted for 43 of total segment sales in 2009 there were no individual customers that accounted for 10 or more of this segment’s net sales 

2010 vs 2009 

net sales increased in 2010 due to higher sales of corning gorilla glass and an increase in sales of display components and semiconductor optics and components when compared to 2009 sales of corning gorilla glass increased as the company moved to capitalize on market opportunities for this product 

the lower net loss in 2010 was driven by higher sales of our corning gorilla glass products and the absence of restructuring charges offset somewhat by the costs associated with adding capacity the net loss in 2009 includes 17 million of restructuring charges for the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in 2010 movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales or net income of this segment 

outlook 

for 2012 we expect sales of this segment to be led by corning gorilla glass in the first quarter of 2012 we expect net sales to be up slightly driven by corning gorilla glass when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 

life sciences 

dollars in millions 

 

  

 2011 vs 2010 

net sales in 2011 increased when compared to 2010 due to a small acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2010 and higher sales in the segment’s existing product lines net sales in 2011 include the favorable impact of 7 million from movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2010 

net income in 2011 was consistent with 2010 reflecting costs for manufacturing expansion projects higher raw materials costs and the impact of the integration of the acquisition completed in 2010 offset by modest volume and price increases net income of this segment was positively impacted by 4 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the prior year 

for 2011 two customers in the life sciences segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of total segment net sales collectively accounted for 39 of total segment sales for 2010 two customers in the life sciences segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of total segment net sales collectively accounted for 37 of total segment sales for 2009 two customers in the life sciences segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of total segment net sales collectively accounted for 45 of total segment sales 

2010 vs 2009 

the increase in net sales in 2010 was driven primarily by the acquisition of axygen which was completed in the third quarter of 2009 and a small acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2010 these acquisitions supported the company’s strategy to expand corning’s portfolio of life sciences products and enhance global customer access in this business and accounted for 117 million of the increase in sales in 2010 when compared to 2009 the segment’s existing products lines also showed strong sales growth in 2010 improving 25 million when compared to 2009 

the improvement in net income in 2010 reflected the sales increases as described above offset somewhat by higher cost of materials and expenses associated with the integration of axygen net income for 2010 also reflected the absence of restructuring charges when compared to 2009 for 2009 net income of this segment included 8 million of restructuring charges associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the net sales or net income for this operating segment 

  

outlook 

sales of the life sciences segment for 2012 are expected to be strong primarily due to an increase in organic sales and the impact of a small acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 in the first quarter of 2012 we expect net sales to be up approximately 10 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 driven partially by the impact of a full quarter of results for the small acquisition completed at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011 

all other 

dollars in millions 

 

  

 all other includes all other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting this group is primarily comprised of development projects that involve the use of various technologies for new products such as advanced flow reactors thinfilm photovoltaics and adjacency businesses in pursuit of thin strong glass this segment also includes results for certain corporate investments such as samsung corning precision’s nonlcd glass businesses eurokera and keraglass equity affiliates which manufacture smooth cooktop glassceramic products and corsam technologies llc corsam an equity affiliate established between corning and samsung corning precision to provide glass technology research refer to note 7 investments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about samsung corning precision and related party transactions 

2011 vs 2010 

the increase in net loss in 2011 when compared to 2010 in this segment was driven by lower equity earnings from samsung corning precision’s nonlcd glass businesses partially offset by lower research development and engineering expenses 

2010 vs 2009 

the decrease in the net loss in this segment for 2010 is primarily due to improved equity earnings from corporate investments and lower operating costs offset by the costs of exiting our synthetic green laser program and the startup costs for new business development projects 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

financing and capital structure 

the following items impacted corning’s financing and capital structure during 2011 and 2010 

 

          on october 5 2011 corning’s board of directors declared a 50 increase in the company’s quarterly common stock dividend corning’s quarterly dividend increased from 005 per share to 0075 per share 

in december 2010 we amended and restated our revolving credit facility to provide a 10 billion committed unsecured multicurrency revolving line of credit through december 2015 the facility includes two financial covenants a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio at december 31 2011 and 2010 we were in compliance with both financial covenants 

capital spending 

capital spending totaled 24 billion 10 billion and 09 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively capital spending increased significantly in 2011 when compared to 2010 and 2009 driven largely by several multiyear investment plans announced in 2010 that will increase manufacturing capacity in several of our reportable segments specifically the increase in spending in 2011 was driven by construction costs for an lcd glass substrate facility in china for our display technologies segment and a capacity expansion project for specialty materials’ corning gorilla glass in japan we expect our 2012 capital spending to be about 18 billion approximately 800 million will be allocated to our display technologies segment of which approximately 400 million will be related to 2011 capital projects 

  

cash flows 

summary of cash flow data in millions 

 

 2011 vs 2010 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2011 when compared to 2010 driven largely by a nonrecurring special dividend of almost 900 million received from samsung corning precision in 2010 and a decrease in cash from changes in working capital additionally in 2011 we received 66 million for the remainder of the settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims a decrease of 193 million from the amount we received in 2010 as partial payment for these claims these negative events were partially offset by a 350 million decrease in contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2011 

net cash used in investing activities was higher in 2011 when compared to 2010 due to an increase in capital spending and two small acquisitions completed in 2011 capital spending was driven primarily by capacity projects to support growth in demand in our display technologies and specialty materials segments the increase in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by higher cash received from shortterm investments liquidations 

net cash used in financing activities increased in 2011 when compared to 2010 driven by common stock repurchases and an increase in our dividend rate from 005 per share to 0075 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011 

2010 vs 2009 

operating cash flow increased significantly in 2010 when compared to 2009 driven largely by a special dividend of almost 900 million received from samsung corning precision we also recorded a credit in the amount of 324 million as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims and received cash totaling 259 million from our panel of insurance carriers representing a partial payment of this settlement additionally we issued less credits against customer deposits in 2010 when compared to 2009 these positive events were partially offset by higher contributions to our defined benefit pension plan in 2010 and the decrease in cash from changes in working capital 

net cash used in investing activities was higher in 2010 when compared to 2009 due to an increase in shortterm investment purchases and higher capital expenditures offset by lower costs for the acquisition of businesses 

net cash provided by financing activities increased in 2010 primarily due to the increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options offset somewhat by the net cash impact of financing activities 

defined benefit pension plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees our largest single pension plan is corning’s us qualified plan at december 31 2011 this plan accounted for 81 of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation and 91 of the related plans’ assets 

we have historically contributed to the us qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the irs minimum requirements and as a result mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until some time after 2013 in 2011 we made no voluntary cash contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and 5 million to our international pension plans in 2010 we made voluntary cash contributions of 350 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and 5 million to our international pension plans 

in 2008 we experienced significant negative returns on our pension assets for our primary defined benefit plan as a result of deteriorating financial market conditions which increased pension expense for 2009 by 33 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 actual investment experience on the pension assets of our primary defined benefit plan was favorable driven by the performance of public equity markets commodities and long duration fixed income securities 

  

although we will not be subject to any mandatory contributions in 2012 we anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of up to 75 million to our us pension plan and up to 30 million to our international pension plans in 2012 

refer to note 13 employee retirement plans to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

customer deposits 

certain customers of our display technologies segment entered into longterm supply agreements and agreed to make advance cash deposits to secure supply of largesize glass substrates the deposits were reduced through future product purchases thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods 

between 2004 and 2007 we received a total of 937 million for customer deposit agreements we received our last deposit of 105 million in 2007 and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements 

in 2011 2010 and 2009 we issued credit memoranda which totaled 28 million 83 million and 253 million respectively these credit amounts were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due as of december 31 2011 no additional deposits have been received and all amounts previously owed as credits have been applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due 

dividends from equity companies 

in the third quarter of 2011 corning hungary data services llc and samsung electronics corporation as shareholders of samsung corning precision agreed to have samsung corning precision increase its annual dividend to shareholders from 40 to 70 of its net income from the previous year subject to the maintenance of minimum cash balances 

restructuring 

in 2009 we recorded charges of 228 million associated with a corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009 the charge included costs for severance special termination benefits outplacement services asset writeoffs and the impact of a curtailment loss for postretirement benefits total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately 150 million primarily related to termination benefits 

during 2011 2010 and 2009 we made payments of 16 million 66 million and 89 million respectively related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions refer to note 2 restructuring impairment and other charges credits to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

key balance sheet data 

balance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table dollars in millions 

 

  

   

credit ratings 

as of february 13 2012 our credit ratings were as follows 

 

 management assessment of liquidity 

we ended the fourth quarter of 2011 with over 58 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments the company has adequate sources of liquidity and we are confident in our ability to generate cash to meet existing or reasonably likely future cash requirements our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted at december 31 2011 approximately 65 of the consolidated amount was held outside of the us almost all of the amounts held outside of the us are available for repatriation subject to relevant tax consequences we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed in the fourth quarter of 2010 we repatriated to the us approximately 11 billion of 2010 earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries we expect previously accumulated nonus cash balances will remain outside of the us in addition to the cash repatriated in 2010 we expect that we will meet us liquidity needs through future cash flows use of us cash balances external borrowings or some combination of these sources 

realized gains and losses for 2011 and 2010 were not significant volatility in financial markets may limit corning’s access to capital markets and result in terms and conditions that by historical comparisons are more restrictive and costly to corning still from time to time we may issue debt the proceeds of which may be used to refinance certain debt maturities and for general corporate purposes refer to note 3 availableforsale investments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

during 2011 we repurchased 55 million shares of common stock for 780 million as part of a share repurchase program announced on october 5 2011 there were no repurchases in 2010 or 2009 

we complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial statements at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk we closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues we currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues 

our major source of funding for 2012 and beyond will be our operating cash flow and our existing balances of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments as well as proceeds from any potential issuances of debt we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations our share repurchase program the asbestos litigation research and development capital expenditures scheduled debt repayments and dividend payments 

corning also has access to two credit facilities a 10 billion unsecured committed revolving line of credit and a 40 billion chinese renminbi rmb credit agreement approximately 635 million when translated to usd these two credit facilities include two financial covenants a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio the required leverage ratio which measures debt to total capital is a maximum of 50 at december 31 2011 and 2010 our leverage using this measure was 10 and 11 respectively the required interest coverage ratio which is an adjusted earnings measure as defined by our facility compared to interest expense is a ratio of at least 35 times at december 31 2011 and 2010 our interest coverage ratio using this measure was 417 times and 402 times respectively at december 31 2011 and 2010 we were in compliance with both financial covenants 

  

our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events in addition the majority of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision whereby a default on one debt obligation of the company in excess of a specified amount also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument as of december 31 2011 we were in compliance with all such provisions 

management is not aware of any known trends demands commitments events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in our liquidity in addition other than items discussed there are no known material trends favorable or unfavorable in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources 

off balance sheet arrangements 

off balance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 

corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include the following 

 

  at the time a guarantee is issued the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant 

refer to note 14 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

for variable interest entities we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of its expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests which are the ownership contractual or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests 

corning has identified four entities that qualify as variable interest entities none of these entities is considered to be significant to corning’s consolidated statements of position 

corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit liquidity or market risk support to that entity 

  

contractual obligations 

the amounts of our obligations follow in millions 

 

  

     we are required at the time a guarantee is issued to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant 

we have agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow corning the funding of the dow corning credit facility will be required only if dow corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed bankruptcy plan the purchase obligations primarily represent raw material and energyrelated takeorpay contracts we believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 

environment 

corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 18 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by the agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2011 and 2010 corning had accrued approximately 25 million undiscounted and 30 million undiscounted respectively for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 

  

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates that required us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates follow 

impairment of assets held for use 

we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified we review our longlived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 

manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals primarily platinum and rhodium these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of longlived assets this review considers all of the company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process in reclamation fabrication or refinement in anticipation of reuse or awaiting use to support increased capacity precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other nonmanufacturing related purposes 

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include 

 

      for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for the majority of our reportable segments we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

for longlived assets when impairment indicators are present we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used assessments also consider changes in asset utilization including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 

for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability described above the estimated fair value of longlived assets is determined using an “income approach” “market approach” “cost approach” or a combination of one or more of these approaches as appropriate for the particular asset group being reviewed all of these approaches start with the forecast of expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of longlived assets and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals if appropriate for the asset group being reviewed some of the more significant estimates and assumptions in our analysis include market size and growth market share projected selling prices manufacturing cost and discount rate our estimates are based upon our historical experience our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

  

in the event the current net book value of an asset group is found to be greater than the net present value of the cash flows derived from the asset group we determine the actual fair market value of longlived assets with the assistance from valuation appraisals conducted by third parties the results of these valuations generally represent the fair market value of the asset group that will remain after any necessary impairment adjustments have been recorded the impairment charge will be allocated to assets within the asset group on a relative fair value basis 

at december 31 2011 the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by 304 million at december 31 2010 the fair market value of precious metals was higher than our carrying value by 415 million for the current reporting period the undiscounted cash flow test shows that these precious metal assets primarily in the display technologies segment are recoverable as part of their asset groupings the potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of our segments such events include but are not limited to a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our display technologies or specialty materials segments 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 the specialty materials segment recorded a 130 million impairment charge related to certain assets located in japan used in the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass large cover glass is primarily used as a cover sheet of strengthened glass for frameless bezelless lcd displays the large cover glass impairment charge represents a writedown of assets specific to the glassstrengthening process for large size cover glass to their relative fair market values as of the date of impairment this asset group includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process and facilities dedicated to the ion exchange process 

for the year ended december 31 2010 we did not identify any instances where the carrying values of our longlived assets were not recoverable 

impairment of goodwill 

we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units 

corning’s goodwill relates primarily to the telecommunications specialty materials and life sciences operating segments our annual goodwill recoverability assessment has historically been performed in the fourth quarter as it is traditionally based on our annual strategic planning process this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the longterm growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows our valuation method is an “income approach” using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return our estimates are based upon our historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends our latest detailed assessment was completed in the fourth quarter of 2009 and because we met the required criteria was carried forward in 2010 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we early adopted the guidance found in accounting standards update no 201108 which simplifies how an entity tests goodwill for impairment it provides an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the following summarizes our process to assess our goodwill balances for impairment 

 

           

the examples noted above are not allinclusive and the company shall consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test 

we anticipate performing a detailed goodwill recoverability test in the second half of 2012 and every three years thereafter unless indicators suggest otherwise 

telecommunications 

goodwill for the telecommunications segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test for this reporting unit which was evaluated in the fourth quarter of 2010 the results of our impairment tests in 2009 and the update in 2010 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount a discount rate of 9 was used in 2009 we determined a range of discount rates between 7 and 11 would not have affected our conclusion in evaluating goodwill recoverability in the telecommunications segment in the fourth quarter of 2011 we assessed qualitative factors in this reporting unit to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test based on our qualitative assessment including but not limited to consideration of the above factors we concluded that it is more likely than not that there has not been a significant decrease in the amount that fair value exceeds the carrying value of goodwill in the telecommunications reporting unit 

specialty materials 

goodwill for the specialty materials segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is one level below an operating segment as goodwill is the result of transactions associated with certain businesses within this operating segment 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test for this reporting unit which was evaluated in the fourth quarter of 2010 the results of our impairment tests in 2009 and the update in 2010 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount a discount rate of 9 was used in 2009 we determined a range of discount rates between 7 and 11 would not have affected our conclusion in evaluating goodwill recoverability in the fourth quarter of 2011 we assessed qualitative factors in this reporting unit to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test based on our qualitative assessment including but not limited to consideration of the above factors we concluded that it is more likely than not that there has not been a significant decrease in the amount that fair value exceeds the carrying value of goodwill in the specialty materials reporting unit additionally the large cover glass impairment incurred in the fourth quarter of 2011 did not cause a triggering event for goodwill impairment in this reporting unit because the cash flow related to this lower level asset group is not material to this reporting unit 

life sciences 

goodwill for the life sciences segment is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test for this reporting unit which was evaluated in the fourth quarter of 2010 the results of our impairment tests in 2009 and the update in 2010 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount a discount rate of 8 was used in 2009 we determined a range of discount rates between 6 and 10 would not have affected our conclusion in evaluating goodwill recoverability in the fourth quarter of 2011 we assessed qualitative factors in this reporting unit to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test based on our qualitative assessment including but not limited to consideration of the above factors we concluded that it is more likely than not that there has not been a significant decrease in the amount that fair value exceeds the carrying value of goodwill in the life sciences reporting unit 

as a result of the assessment of the qualitative factors we have determined it is not necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test on our reporting units 

  

restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions 

we are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including for example employee termination costs restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses of portions thereof their profitability cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome the judgment involved can be difficult subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses 

restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which as a result require impairment we are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned 

income taxes 

we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environments in which we do business it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances 

significant estimates and assumptions used in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets included the longterm stabilization of us income from forecasted royalty income in our display technologies operating segment the longterm growth of our diesel business and the future success of new products 

equity method investments 

at december 31 2011 and 2010 the carrying value of our equity method investments was 47 billion and 44 billion respectively with our two largest equity method investments comprising approximately 95 of the balance we review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if an event or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be otherthantemporarily impaired when such indicators are present we then perform an indepth review for impairment an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability forecasted tax rates foreign currency exchange rate movements terminal value assumptions historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends 

as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable 

fair value measures 

as required corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the company’s own market assumptions once inputs have been characterized we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement in addition observable market data must be used when available and the highestandbestuse measure should be applied to nonfinancial assets corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are shortterm and longterm investments certain pension asset investments and derivatives these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions 

derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in arriving at the fair value of corning’s derivative assets and liabilities we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction amounts related to credit risk are not material 

  

the level 3 assets measured with unobservable inputs relate to certain pension asset investments and all longlived assets fair valued on a nonrecurring basis related to the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass resulting in an impairment charge of 130 million which was included in earnings for the period refer to note 16 fair value measurements of the consolidated financial statements for further detail 

probability of litigation outcomes 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter case law and other casespecific issues see part ii – item 3 legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face the most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability including the inherent complexity of a chapter 11 filing our history of success in defending asbestos claims our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses and our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants’ representatives the proposed asbestos resolution amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies the approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is not certain and faces objections by some parties any approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is subject to appeal for these and other reasons corning’s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters the estimate of the cost of resolving the nonpcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning’s financial statements is remote 

other possible liabilities 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters including certain tax planning and environmental matters these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 

pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb 

pension and opeb costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates benefits earned interest cost expected return on plan assets mortality rates and other factors actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s employee pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 

as of december 31 2011 the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was 2855 million 

the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans 

 

 the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning’s funding requirements 

in addition at december 31 2011 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders’ equity by 104 million before tax and a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders’ equity by 101 million in addition the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate 

  

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to corning’s us opeb plans 

 

  

 the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned in certain instances revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns allowances discounts and other factors these estimates are supported by historical data while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning’s future results 

sharebased compensation 

sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates sharebased compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects 

 

  we have foreign currency exposure to many currencies including the japanese yen euro new taiwan dollar and korean won we selectively enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with durations generally 18 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases these hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions the objective of these contracts is to reduce the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or corning enter into lending situations generally on an intercompany basis denominated in currencies other than their local currency we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes corning uses derivative instruments forwards to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and as such are referred to as undesignated hedges changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities are recorded in current period earnings in other income net in the consolidated statements of income 

equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations equity in earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments were 15 billion and 20 billion in 2011 and 2010 respectively with foreignbased affiliates comprising over 71 of this amount in 2011 equity earnings from samsung corning precision totaled 10 billion for 2011 and 15 billion for 2010 exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies 

we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2011 with respect to open forward contracts and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 275 million compared to 360 million at december 31 2010 specific to the japanese yen a 10 adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 241 million compared to 272 million at december 31 2010 specific to the euro a 10 adverse movement in quoted euro exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 23 million compared to 83 million at december 31 2010 

as we derive approximately 75 of our net sales from outside the us our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies most notably the japanese yen and euro our forecasts generally assume exchange rates during 2012 remain constant at january 2012 levels as an example of impact changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our financial results we compare 2011 actual sales in yen and euro transaction currencies at an average currency exchange rate during the year to a 10 change in the currency exchange rate a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar  japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2011 net sales of approximately 410 million a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar  euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2011 net sales of approximately 96 million using 2011 net income attributable to corning incorporated as a percentage of net sales of 36 we can estimate that a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar  japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2011 net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately 146 million a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar  euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2011 net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately 34 million 

interest rate risk management 

it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2011 our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than 1 of variable rate instruments

 item 1 business 

general 

corning traces its origins to a glass business established in 1851 the present corporation was incorporated in the state of new york in december 1936 the company’s name was changed from corning glass works to corning incorporated on april 28 1989 

corning is a global technologybased corporation that operates in five reportable business segments display technologies telecommunications environmental technologies specialty materials and life sciences corning manufactures and processes products at approximately 60 plants in 14 countries 

display technologies segment

raw materials 

corning’s production of specialty glasses ceramics and related materials requires significant quantities of energy uninterrupted power sources certain precious metals and various batch materials 

although energy shortages have not been a problem recently the cost of energy remains volatile corning has achieved flexibility through important engineering changes to take advantage of lowcost energy sources in most significant processes specifically many of corning’s principal manufacturing processes can be operated with natural gas propane oil or electricity or a combination of these energy sources 

availability of resources ores minerals polymers and processed chemicals required in manufacturing operations appears to be adequate corning’s suppliers from time to time may experience capacity limitations in their own operations or may eliminate certain product lines corning believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch materials and precious metals for many products corning has alternate glass compositions that would allow operations to continue without interruption in the event of specific materials shortages 

certain key materials and proprietary equipment used in the manufacturing of products are currently solesourced or available only from a limited number of suppliers any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in lost sales due to delays or reductions in product shipments or reductions in corning’s gross margins

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report or otherwise have a detrimental affect on the company these risks should be considered in making any investment decisions in corning future results could be affected materially by general industry and market conditions changes in laws or accounting rules general economic and political conditions including a global economic slowdown fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates terrorism political unrest or international conflicts political instability or major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this annual report other risks not described above or unknown to us may also adversely affect corning or its results 

as a result of ongoing volatility in the economies of the united states and many other countries a number of the risks we normally face may increase in both our consolidated operations and at our equity method investments these include 

 

         

our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or circumstances of one or more key customers leading to the substantial reduction in orders for our products 

in 2010 corning’s ten largest customers accounted for 55 of our sales 

in addition a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in our reportable operating segments for 2010 three customers of the display technologies segment accounted for 72 of total segment net sales when combined in the telecommunications segment one customer accounted for 15 of segment net sales in the environmental technologies segment three customers accounted for 86 of total segment sales in aggregate in the specialty materials segment three customers accounted for 43 of segment sales in 2010 in the life sciences segment two distributors accounted for 37 of segment sales in 2010 as a result of mergers and consolidations between customers corning’s customer base could become more concentrated 

samsung corning precision’s sales were also concentrated in 2010 with sales to two lcd panel makers located in south korea accounting for approximately 93 of total samsung corning precision sales 

the sale of lcd glass substrates in 2010 and previous years provide no assurance that positive trends will continue our customers are lcd panel and color filter makers as they switch to larger size glass the pace of their orders may be uneven while they adjust their manufacturing processes and facilities additionally consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes designs price or other seasonal factors may lead to pauses in market growth from time to time our customers may not be able to maintain their profitability or access sufficient capital to fund routine maintenance and operations or planned expansions which may limit their pace of orders to us emerging material technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications resulting in a decline in demand for our lcd products technologies for displays in competition with lcd panels may reduce or eliminate the need for our glass substrates these technologies may include organic light emitting diodes and plasma display panels new process technologies developed by our competitors may also place us at a cost or quality disadvantage our inability to manufacture glass substrates in the sizes and quantities needed by our customers may result in loss of revenue margins and profits or liabilities for failure to supply a scarcity of resources limitations on technology personnel or other factors resulting in a failure to produce commercial quantities of very largesize glass substrates particularly from facilities at a major customer in japan could have adverse financial consequences to us 

our telecommunications segment customers’ purchases of our products are affected by their capital expansion plans general market and economic uncertainty and regulatory changes including broadband policy sales in the telecommunications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of fibertothepremises deployments by our customers such as bell canada bell aliant nbn co and verizon communications inc our sales will be dependent on planned targets for homes passed and connected changes in our customers’ deployment plans could adversely affect future sales in any quarter or for the full year 

in the environmental technologies segment sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for automotive and diesel emissions are expected to fluctuate with vehicle production changes in governmental laws and regulations for air quality and emission controls may also influence future sales sales in our environmental technologies segment are mainly to three catalyzers and emission system control manufacturers our customers sell these systems to automobile and diesel engine original equipment manufacturers sales in this segment may be affected by adverse developments in the global vehicle or freight hauling industries or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicle sales or downturns in freight traffic 

certain sales in our specialty materials segment track worldwide economic cycles and our customers’ responses to that cycle in addition sales of strengthened glass for personal handheld devices and lcd television cover glass may fail to materialize we may experience losses relating to our inability to supply contracted quantities of this glass and new processes currently planned to produce this glass may not be successful 

sales in our life sciences segment are through two large distributors and the remaining balance is to a variety of government entities pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies hospitals universities and other research facilities in 2010 our two largest distributors accounted for 37 of life sciences’ segment sales changes in our distribution arrangements in this segment may adversely affect this segment’s financial results 

  

if the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate demand for our products may decline which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial performance 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies evolving industry or government standards and new product introductions our success is expected to depend in substantial part on the successful introduction of new products or upgrades of current products and our ability to compete with new technologies the following factors related to our products and markets if not achieved could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

 

        we face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely affect our financial performance 

we face pricing pressure in each of our leading businesses as a result of intense competition emerging new technologies or overcapacity while we work consistently toward reducing our costs to offset pricing pressures we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or sustain our current rate of cost reduction we anticipate pricing pressures will continue into 2011 and beyond in all our businesses 

we face risks related to our international operations and sales 

we have customers and significant operations including manufacturing and sales located outside the us we have large manufacturing operations for liquid crystal display glass substrates in taiwan japan and korea including an equity investment in samsung corning precision operating in south korea that makes glass substrates for the korean lcd market all of our display segment customers are located in the asiapacific region as a result of these and other international operations we face a number of risks including 

 

          any of these items could cause our sales or profitability to be significantly reduced 

additionally a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our display technologies segment is concentrated in three overseas countries and it is reasonably possible that the operations of one or more such facilities could be disrupted due to the specialized nature of the assets and the customers’ locations it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from facilities in other countries accordingly loss of these facilities could produce a nearterm severe impact on our display business and the company as a whole 

  

we face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations 

because we have significant customers and operations outside the us fluctuations in foreign currencies especially the japanese yen new taiwan dollar korean won and euro affect our sales and profit levels foreign exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the us dollar and japanese yen sales in our display technologies segment representing 45 of corning’s sales in 2010 are denominated in japanese yen if sales grow in our display technologies segment our exposure to currency fluctuations will increase corning hedges significant transaction and balance sheet currency exposures and uses derivatives instruments to limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities as well as operating results although we selectively hedge these items changes in exchange rates especially the japanese yen to us dollar will significantly impact our reported revenues and profits 

if the financial condition of our customers declines our credit risks could increase 

although we have a rigorous process to administer credit and believe our allowance is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable if our customers or our indirect customers fail to meet their payment obligations for our products we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amounts reserved some customers of our display technologies segment are thinly capitalized andor marginally profitable in our environmental technologies segment the us auto makers and certain of their suppliers have encountered credit downgrades or have filed for bankruptcy protection these factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business 

if we do not successfully adjust our manufacturing volumes and fixed cost structure or achieve manufacturing yields or sufficient product reliability our operating results and cash flow could suffer and we may not achieve anticipated profitability levels 

investments in additional manufacturing capacity of certain businesses including liquid crystal display glass and diesel emission substrates and filters present challenges we may face technical and process issues in moving to commercial production and there can be no assurance that corning will be able to pace its capacity expansion to the actual demand economic results may adversely affect our ability to complete planned capacity expansion and products it is possible that manufacturing capacity may exceed or lag customer demand during certain periods 

the manufacturing of our products involves highly complex and precise processes requiring production in highly controlled and dustfree environments changes in our manufacturing processes could significantly reduce our manufacturing yields and product reliability in some cases existing manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the requirements of our customers we will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to achieve targeted volume pricing and cost levels that will permit profitable operations while we continue to fund projects to improve our manufacturing techniques and processes we may not achieve satisfactory cost levels in our manufacturing activities that will fully satisfy our profitability targets 

our future financial performance depends on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials precious metals parts and manufacturing equipment components to meet the demands of our customers 

our ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials precious metals parts and components from our suppliers we may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages there can be no assurances that we will not encounter these problems in the future furthermore certain manufacturing equipment raw materials or components are available only from a single source or limited sources we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner a reduction interruption or delay of supply or a significant increase in the price for supplies such as manufacturing equipment precious metals raw materials or energy could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

we have incurred and may in the future incur restructuring and other charges the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately 

we have recorded several charges for restructuring impairment of assets and the writeoff of cost and equitybased investments in the past certain of our equity affiliates have also recorded restructuring charges we and our affiliates may have additional actions that result in restructuring charges in the future 

  

we have incurred and may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 

at december 31 2010 corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of 716 million while we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe or if acquisitions made by the company fail to achieve expected returns 

if our products including materials purchased from our suppliers experience performance issues our business will suffer 

our business depends on the production of products of consistently high quality our products components and materials purchased from our suppliers are typically tested for quality these testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios for various reasons our products including materials purchased from our suppliers may fail to perform as expected in some cases product redesigns or additional expense may be required to correct a defect a significant or systemic product failure could result in customer relations problems lost sales and financial damages 

we face competition in most of our businesses 

we expect that we will face continuous competition from existing competitors low cost manufacturers and new entrants we must invest in research and development expand our engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities and continue to improve customer service and support in order to remain competitive we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position 

changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors some of which are outside of our control including 

 

      in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals 

accounting and disclosure rules may affect financial results 

generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations for many areas of our business such as revenue recognition accounting for investments fair value estimates and accounting for stock options are very complex and involve significant and sometimes subjective judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantly impact our reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures in the future without a corresponding change in our cash flows 

we rely on key personnel and the loss of their services or the inability to attract and retain them may negatively affect our businesses 

our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified research and development engineering and operating personnel generally and during periods of rapid growth especially in those of our businesses focused on new products and advanced manufacturing processes is essential to our business success we also depend on the services of experienced key senior management 

the loss of the services of any of our key research and development engineering or operational personnel or senior management without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance 

  

we are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations 

our manufacturing process generates chemical waste waste water and other industrial waste and greenhouse gases at various stages in the manufacturing process and we are currently or may be in the future subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of such substances we have installed antipollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities we have taken steps to affect the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations however we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps toward adopting more stringent environment standards 

any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us or the suspensioncessation of production or operations in addition environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the us and other countries such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and co 2 abatement may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by among other things substantially increasing manufacturing costs limiting availability of scarce resources especially energy or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers 

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses we cannot assure you that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to protect our intellectual property litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently uncertain and the outcome is often unpredictable other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios 

the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products we are and may in the future be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation that may result in loss of revenue require us to incur substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us we cannot assure you as to the outcome of any such claims 

current or future litigation may harm our financial condition or results of operations 

pending threatened or future litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes expenses and costs exceeding amounts estimated or insured in particular we have been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos and adverse rulings in such lawsuits or the inability to successfully resolve such matters may adversely affect the company as described in legal proceedings a new pcc plan of reorganization was filed with the bankruptcy court on january 29 2009 proposing a resolution of pcc asbestos claims it remains reasonably possible that changes to this new pcc plan may be negotiated and the elements of the plan and its approval are subject to a number of contingencies before the resolution outlined in that plan becomes final 

we face risks through our equity method investments in companies that we do not control 

corning’s net income includes significant equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended december 31 2010 we recognized 20 billion of equity earnings of which 98 came from our two largest investments dow corning which makes silicone and high purity polycrystalline products and samsung corning precision which primarily makes liquid crystal display glass samsung corning precision is located in the asiapacific region and is subject to political and geographic risks mentioned above as well as business and other risks within the display technologies segment our equity investments may not continue to perform at the same levels as in recent years in 2007 we recognized equity losses associated with samsung corning co ltd a 50 equity method investment that made glass panels and funnels for conventional televisions which recorded fixed asset and other impairment charges dow corning emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2004 and has certain obligations under its plan of reorganization to resolve and fund claims of its creditors and personal injury claimants dow corning may incur further bankruptcy charges in the future which may adversely affect its operations or assets 

  

we may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us 

we face the risk of loss resulting from product liability securities fiduciary liability intellectual property antitrust contractual warranty environmental fraud and other lawsuits whether or not such claims are valid in addition our product liability fiduciary directors and officers property including business interruption natural catastrophe and comprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect in the future our insurance costs can be volatile and at any time can increase given changes in market supply and demand and our claim history we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs a successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us to pay substantial sums some of the carriers in our primary and excess insurance programs are in liquidation and may not be able to respond if we should have claims reaching their policies the financial health of other insurers may deteriorate several of our insurance carriers are litigating with us the extent if any of their obligation to provide insurance coverage for asbestos liabilities asserted against us the results of that litigation may adversely affect our insurance coverage for those risks in addition we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain types of risk such as political risks terrorism or war 

our businesses may be subject to increased regulatory enforcement 

some of our business segments operate in industries with a concentrated number of competitors and customers both foreign and domestic while we have adopted a corporatewide compliance program we may become the subject of antitrust or other governmental investigations from many jurisdictions that may adversely impact our reputation or our ability to make and sell products in the future 

the acquisition of businesses by the company may create liabilities or otherwise prove unsuccessful 

acquisition of businesses by the company may result in losses arising from undisclosed or unanticipated liabilities of such businesses or from the failure of such business to achieve the financial results anticipated at the time of their acquisition

as a result of a decline in demand for our lcd glass in the second half of 2008 we temporarily idled more than half of our manufacturing capacity in the display technologies segment by the end of 2008 by the end of 2010 most of this capacity had been brought back online to meet an increase in demand for lcd glass and to replace existing capacity when needed we also utilized some of this manufacturing capacity to satisfy the significant increase in demand for our corning gorilla glass products in 2010 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

environmental litigation corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 20 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by such agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2010 corning had accrued approximately 30 million undiscounted for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 

dow corning bankruptcy corning and dow chemical each own 50 of the common stock of dow corning in may 1995 dow corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousands of breast implant product lawsuits on june 1 2004 dow corning emerged from chapter 11 with a plan of reorganization the plan which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims the plan also includes releases for corning and dow chemical as shareholders in exchange for contributions to the plan

pittsburgh corning corporation corning and ppg industries inc ppg each own 50 of the capital stock of pittsburgh corning corporation pcc over a period of more than two decades pcc and several other defendants have been named in numerous lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos on april 16 2000 pcc filed for chapter 11 reorganization in the us bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania at the time pcc filed for bankruptcy protection there were approximately 11800 claims pending against corning in state court lawsuits alleging various theories of liability based on exposure to pcc’s asbestos products and typically requesting monetary damages in excess of one million dollars per claim corning has defended those claims on the basis of the separate corporate status of pcc and the absence of any facts supporting claims of direct liability arising from pcc’s asbestos products corning is also currently involved in approximately 10300 other cases approximately 38700 claims alleging injuries from asbestos and similar amounts of monetary damages per case those cases have been covered by insurance without material impact to corning to date as described below several of corning’s insurance carriers have filed a legal proceeding concerning the extent of any insurance coverage for these claims asbestos litigation is inherently difficult and past trends in resolving these claims may not be indicators of future outcomes 

on march 28 2003 corning announced that it had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the resolution of all current and future asbestos claims against it and pcc which might arise from pcc products or operations the 2003 plan the 2003 plan would have required corning to relinquish its equity interest in pcc contribute its equity interest in pittsburgh corning europe nv pce a belgian corporation contribute 25 million shares of corning common stock and pay a total of 140 million in six annual installments present value 131 million at march 2003 beginning one year after the plan’s effective date with 55 percent interest from june 2004 in addition the 2003 plan provided that corning would assign certain insurance policy proceeds from its primary insurance and a portion of its excess insurance 

on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court issued an order denying confirmation of the 2003 plan for reasons it set out in a memorandum opinion several parties including corning filed motions for reconsideration these motions were argued on march 5 2007 and the bankruptcy court reserved decision on january 29 2009 a proposed plan of reorganization the amended pcc plan resolving issues raised by the court in denying confirmation of the 2003 plan was filed with the bankruptcy court 

as a result corning believes the amended pcc plan modified as indicated below now represents the most probable outcome of this matter and expects that the amended pcc plan will be confirmed by the court at the same time corning believes the 2003 plan no longer serves as the basis for the company’s best estimate of liability key provisions of the amended pcc plan address the concerns expressed by the bankruptcy court accordingly in the first quarter of 2008 corning adjusted its asbestos litigation liability to reflect components of the amended pcc plan the proposed resolution of pcc asbestos claims under the amended pcc plan requires corning to contribute its equity interests in pcc and pce and to contribute a fixed series of payments recorded at present value corning will have the option to use its shares rather than cash to make these payments but the liability is fixed by dollar value and not the number of shares the amended pcc plan originally required corning to make 1 one payment of 100 million one year from the date the amended pcc plan becomes effective and certain conditions are met and 2 five additional payments of 50 million on each of the five subsequent anniversaries of the first payment the final payment of which is subject to reduction based on the application of credits under certain circumstances documents were filed with the bankruptcy court further modifying the amended pcc plan by reducing corning’s initial payment by 30 million and reducing its second and fourth payments by 15 million each in return corning will relinquish its claim for reimbursement of its payments and contributions under the amended pcc plan from the insurance carriers involved in the bankruptcy proceeding with certain exceptions these modifications are expected to resolve objections to the amended pcc plan filed by some of the insurance carriers confirmation hearings on the amended pcc plan were held in june 2010 and briefs discussing the legal issues have been filed the bankruptcy court opinion on the amended pcc plan is pending 

the amended pcc plan does not include certain nonpcc asbestos claims that may be or have been raised against corning corning has recorded an additional 150 million for such claims in its estimated asbestos litigation liability the liability for nonpcc claims was estimated based upon industry data for asbestos claims since corning does not have recent claim history due to the injunction issued by the bankruptcy court the estimated liability represents the undiscounted projection of claims and related legal fees over the next 20 years the amount may need to be adjusted in future periods as more data becomes available 

the amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies payment of the amounts required to fund the amended pcc plan from insurance and other sources are subject to a number of conditions that may not be achieved the approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is not certain and faces remaining objections by some parties any approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is subject to appeal for these and other reasons corning’s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters the estimate of the cost of resolving the nonpcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning’s financial statements is remote 

  

several of corning’s insurers have commenced litigation in state courts for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies including rights that may be affected by the potential resolutions described above corning is vigorously contesting these cases management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation and therefore cannot estimate the range of any possible loss

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

organization of information 

management’s discussion and analysis provides a historical and prospective narrative on the company’s financial condition and results of operations this discussion includes the following sections 

 

        overview 

operating results improved in all of our operating segments in 2010 when compared to last year despite supply chain variability in the lcd market operating results in our display technologies segment were up significantly in 2010 compared to 2009 due to robust retail demand for lcd products strength in enterprise network products sales coupled with cost reduction efforts drove higher results in our telecommunications segment in 2010 when compared to last year in addition sales increased in 2010 in our environmental technologies segment reflecting improvements in the global automotive market and in the truck market in the united states results in our specialty materials segment were significantly higher in 2010 compared to 2009 driven by strong demand for corning gorilla glass and our display optics and components products results in the life sciences segment were higher due primarily to the impact of acquisitions completed at the end of the third quarter of 2009 and in the fourth quarter of 2010 earnings comparisons to last year also benefited from certain nonoperating items that are described in our discussion of profitability below 

corning remains committed to a strategy of growing through global innovation while preserving our financial independence this strategy has served us well our key priorities for 2010 were similar to those of the previous four years protect our financial health and invest in the future during 2010 we made the following progress on these priorities 

financial health 

despite the uncertainty in the global economic environment our financial position remained sound and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities significant items in 2010 included the following 

 

   profitability 

for the year ended december 31 2010 we generated net income of 36 billion or 225 per share compared to net income of 20 billion or 128 per share for 2009 when compared to last year the increase in net income was due largely to the following items 

 

      

  the increase in net income in 2010 was favorably impacted by 226 million from the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 

investing in our future 

we continue to focus on the future and on what we do best  creating and making keystone components that enable hightechnology systems we remain committed to investing in research development and engineering to drive innovation we continue to work on technologies for glass substrates for active matrix lcds diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that enable fibertothepremises in 2010 we broadened our innovation strategy to include a focus on opportunities that are adjacent or closely related to our existing capabilities these opportunities which include products such as corning gorilla glass for consumer products and thinfilm photovoltaics for solar applications leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes with slight modifications while we continued to make investments in these promising technologies in 2010 we decided to discontinue our development and commercialization of synthetic green laser technologies in the fourth quarter in 2011 our innovation strategy will continue to focus on opportunities that are adjacent or closely related to our existing capabilities 

our research development and engineering expenditures increased by 40 million in 2010 when compared to 2009 but declined slightly as a percentage of net sales we believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies 

in the third quarter of 2010 we announced multiyear investment plans for additional manufacturing capacity that will benefit a number of our segments the plans include 800 million for spending associated with a new lcd glass substrate facility in the people’s republic of china to meet expected growing demand for our lcd glass spending for this facility began in september of 2010 and we expect production to begin in 2012 additional investments will include construction projects in other regions to expand capacity for eagle xg ® lcd glass substrates and will benefit our specialty materials segment by providing capacity for increased demand of corning gorilla glass the plans also include spending in the environmental technologies segment to expand its existing automotive substrate facilities in shanghai china and kaiserslautern germany additionally the plans establish a life sciences manufacturing and distribution facility in wujiang china these facilities are expected to be operational in 2011 and 2012 total capital expenditures for 2010 were 10 billion approximately 500 million was directed toward our display technologies segment in 2010 approximately 140 million in 2010 was invested in our specialty materials segment 

we expect our 2011 capital spending to be about 24 billion to 27 billion approximately 12 billion to 15 billion will be directed toward our display technologies segment 

corporate outlook 

corning expects significant sales growth in 2011 led by strong demand for our corning gorilla glass products we believe worldwide demand for lcd glass in 2011 will increase from 315 billion square feet to approximately 36 to 38 billion square feet when compared to 2010 driven by continued strength in demand for lcd televisions computer notebooks and desktop monitors earnings will be negatively impacted by higher taxes due to the absence of the 2010 tax benefits resulting from our repatriation actions increased income in higher tax rate jurisdictions and tax holiday expirations equity earnings from samsung corning will also be impacted by higher taxes in 2011 cash flow from operations may decline as we expect lower dividends from equity affiliates we will also use more cash for investing activities as we expand our capacity to meet growing demand we may take advantage of acquisition opportunities that support the longterm strategies of our businesses we remain confident that our strategy to grow through global innovation while preserving our financial stability will enable our continued longterm success 

  

results of operations 

selected highlights from our continuing operations follow dollars in millions 

 

  net sales 

net sales in 2010 increased 23 due to higher sales in all of our segments when compared to 2009 driven by volume growth in all of our segments and from the net positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates we saw demand increase for all of our lcd products led by strong growth of lcd televisions outside of the united states sales in our specialty materials segment in 2010 increased 75 when compared to 2009 due to strong demand for corning gorilla glass products our thin sheet glass designed to function as a protective cover glass on display devices sales were also strong in both our environmental technologies and life sciences segments up 38 and 39 respectively 

net sales in 2009 decreased 9 due to lower sales in the majority of our segments when compared to 2008 driven primarily by volume and price declines in the display technologies segment offset somewhat by 194 million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates the largest portion of the net sales decline occurred in the first quarter of 2009 as lcd glass demand fell rapidly in response to worsening economic conditions over the remainder of 2009 we saw demand levels for lcd glass increase in comparison to first quarter levels and we believe a corresponding expansion in the lcd industry supply chain as demand for lcd televisions improved in the fourth quarter of 2009 net sales increased 41 when compared to 2008 and 4 when compared to the third quarter of 2009 driven by increased net sales in the display technologies segment for the full year of 2009 lower volume in the environmental technologies and telecommunications segments also contributed to the decline in net sales as demand for automotive products declined and spending for telecommunications networks contracted 

  

in 2010 net sales into international markets accounted for 74 of net sales for 2009 and 2008 net sales into international markets accounted for 76 and 74 respectively of net sales 

cost of sales 

the types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are raw materials consumption including direct and indirect materials salaries wages and benefits depreciation and amortization production utilities productionrelated purchasing warehousing including receiving and inspection repairs and maintenance interlocation inventory transfer costs production and warehousing facility property insurance rent for production facilities and other production overhead 

gross margin 

for 2010 gross margin in dollars and as a percentage of net sales increased significantly when compared to 2009 due primarily to the impact of volume increases in the display technologies segment offset somewhat by price declines improvements were also driven by strong sales in the environmental technologies and specialty materials segments as well as cost reduction efforts and manufacturing efficiency improvements 

for 2009 gross margin in dollars and as a percentage of net sales declined when compared to 2008 due primarily to the impact of price declines in the display technologies segment and reduced volume in the environmental technologies and telecommunications segments as a percentage of net sales gross margin of 27 in the first quarter of 2009 reflected the sharp decline in net sales as first quarter lcd glass demand continued to fall in response to worsening economic conditions as a percentage of net sales gross margin approximated 41 in the second third and fourth quarters of 2009 and reflected improved demand in a number of our businesses 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2010 were up when compared to 2009 due primarily to higher compensationrelated costs and the costs of integrating our new businesses offset by the impact of restructuring actions completed in 2009 as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses in 2010 were down slightly when compared to 2009 because the rate of increase in sales exceeded the rate of increase in spending for selling general and administrative costs 

the slight decrease in selling general and administrative expenses for 2009 when compared to 2008 in dollars were due primarily to the favorable impact of cost reduction efforts and restructuring actions in 2009 offset somewhat by an increase in performancebased compensation costs 

the types of expenses included in the selling general and administrative expenses line item are salaries wages and benefits travel sales commissions professional fees and depreciation and amortization utilities and rent for administrative facilities 

research development and engineering expenses 

research development and engineering expenses for 2010 increased by 40 million to 603 million in 2010 when compared to 2009 but declined slightly as a percentage of net sales corning’s research development and engineering expenses are currently focused on our display technologies environmental technologies and telecommunications segments as we strive to capitalize on growth opportunities in those segments excluding these segments the largest driver of spending continues to be for adjacent products such as corning gorilla glass and research for new business development we believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies 

research development and engineering expenses decreased by 64 million in 2009 when compared to 2008 but remained fairly constant as a percentage of net sales reduced spending in 2009 was driven primarily by the impact of restructuring actions and cost reduction efforts 

  

restructuring impairment and other charges and credits 

corning recorded restructuring impairment and other charges and credits in 2010 2009 and 2008 which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented a description of those charges and credits follows 

2010 activity 

during 2009 we had two events which impacted production at several of our lcd glass manufacturing facilities in august 2009 an earthquake halted production at one of our lcd glass manufacturing facilities in japan and in october 2009 production at our facility in taichung taiwan was impacted by a power disruption in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded 324 million in other credits as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims resulting from these events of which 259 million was received in cash through december 31 2010

in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009 we recorded charges of 228 million in 2009 primarily for a corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce the charges included costs for severance special termination benefits outplacement services and the impact of a 32 million curtailment loss for postretirement benefits in 2009 total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately 150 million with the majority of spending completed by 2010 we estimate annualized savings from these actions will be about 224 million and will be reflected largely in cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses 

2008 activity 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded 22 million of severance costs primarily for a restructuring plan in the telecommunications segment 

asbestos litigation 

in 2010 we recorded a decrease to our asbestos litigation liability of 49 million compared to a net increase of 20 million in 2009 the net decrease in 2010 was due primarily to a 54 million decrease to our estimated liability for asbestos litigation that was recorded in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the change in terms of the proposed settlement of the pcc asbestos claims for the remainder of 2010 we recorded net credit adjustments to our asbestos litigation liability of 5 million to reflect the change in value of the estimated settlement liability 

in 2009 we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of 20 million compared to a net decrease of 340 million in 2008 the net decrease in 2008 was due primarily to a 327 million reduction to our estimated liability for asbestos litigation that was recorded in the first quarter of 2008 as a result of the increase in the likelihood of a settlement under more recently proposed terms and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under terms that had been established in 2003 for the remainder of 2008 we recorded net credit adjustments of 13 million to reflect the change in value of the estimated settlement liability 

our asbestos litigation liability was estimated to be 633 million at december 31 2010 compared with an estimate of 682 million at december 31 2009 the entire obligation is classified as a noncurrent liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than 12 months after the proposed plan is ultimately effective and a portion of the obligation fulfilled through the direct contribution of corning’s investment in pce currently recorded as a noncurrent other equity method investment

equity in earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments 

the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments in millions 

 

   

the increase in equity earnings of affiliated companies in 2010 reflected strong sales and earnings performance at samsung corning precision and at dow corning when compared to last year equity earnings at samsung corning precision reflected the positive impact of increased volume a nonrecurring tax benefit and movements in foreign exchange rates offset somewhat by price declines when compared to 2009 

the increase in equity earnings of affiliated companies in 2009 was driven by samsung corning precision when compared to the same period last year equity earnings at samsung corning precision reflected increased volume manufacturing efficiency gains and the positive impact from movements in foreign exchange rates offset somewhat by lower pricing when compared to 2008 

the change in equity earnings from samsung corning precision is explained more fully in the discussion of the performance of the display technologies segment and in all other 

the increase in equity earnings from dow corning in 2010 when compared to 2009 was primarily due to the following items 

 

    the decline in equity earnings from dow corning in 2009 was primarily due to lower sales and restructuring charges at dow corning offset somewhat by the impact of excess foreign tax credits on foreign dividends when compared to the previous year sales at dow corning declined 7 in 2009 when compared to 2008 and included volume declines in dow corning’s traditional silicone businesses that were offset somewhat by an increase in volume at hemlock sales of dow corning’s traditional silicone businesses reflected the impact of the economic downturn in 2009 sales at hemlock increased in 2009 driven by improvements in sales for solar applications when compared to 2008 movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact equity earnings from dow corning 

sales at dow corning in 2011 are expected to increase when compared to 2010 driven by higher sales of silicone products and an increase in sales at hemlock in the first quarter of 2011 equity earnings from dow corning are expected to be up slightly when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 

other income expense net 

“other income expense net” in corning’s consolidated statements of income includes the following in millions 

 

 income before income taxes 

in addition to the items identified under gross margin restructuring impairment and other credits and charges asbestos litigation credit charge and other income expense net movements in foreign exchange rates also impacted results for the years presented in 2010 income before income taxes included 229 million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2009 in 2009 income before income taxes included 414 million for the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the previous year 

  

provision benefit for income taxes 

our provision benefit for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows in millions 

 

 the effective income tax rate for 2010 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

 

     the effective income tax rate for 2009 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

 

      the effective income tax benefit rate for 2008 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

 

     as more fully described in note 6 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements all of our us deferred tax assets had full valuation allowances until the second quarter of 2008 at that time we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize substantially all of our us deferred tax assets because we expect to generate sufficient levels of income in the us as a result we released 24 billion of valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2008 we considered all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence a valuation allowance was needed 

the evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets is inherently subjective following are the key items that provided positive evidence to support the release of the valuation allowance for a large portion of our deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2008 

 

      

at june 30 2008 the following items were considered as negative evidence in our valuation allowance assessment but were less heavily weighted than our positive evidence 

 

   deferred tax liabilities totaled 26 million at december 31 2008 and therefore were not a significant factor in our assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets 

in 2008 we generated income from continuing operations in the us the tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of our existing valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of us income the impact of the release of the valuation allowances and thus not recording tax expense on income generated in the us was a reduction in our effective tax rate of 86 percentage points for 2008 

certain shorterlived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss carry forwards and state tax net operating loss carry forwards as well as other federal and state tax credits will remain with a valuation allowance recorded against them as of december 31 2010 because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire us profits of approximately 83 billion will be required to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of december 31 2010 of that amount 49 billion of us profits will be required over the next 15 years to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with federal net operating loss carry forwards the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized as the underlying temporary differences reverse over an extended period the amount of us and foreign deferred tax assets that had valuation allowances at december 31 2010 and 2009 was 214 million and 245 million respectively 

we currently provide income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies to the extent these earnings are currently taxable or expected to be remitted as of december 31 2010 taxes have not been provided on approximately 89 billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings that are expected to remain invested indefinitely it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings 

certain foreign subsidiaries in china and taiwan are operating under tax holiday arrangements the nature and extent of such arrangements vary and the benefits of such arrangements phase out through 2014 according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 31 73 and 53 percentage points for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

while we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next 12 months we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position 

see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding income tax matters 

net income attributable to corning incorporated 

as a result of the items discussed above net income and per share data was as follows in millions except per share amounts 

 

   

operating segments 

our reportable operating segments are as follows 

 

     all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “all other” this group is primarily comprised of development projects and results for new product lines 

we prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions we included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segment’s net income we have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for standalone financial information segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements 

effective january 1 2009 we began providing us income tax expense or benefit on us earnings losses due to the change in our conclusion about the realizability of our us deferred tax assets in 2008 as a result of the change in our tax position we adjusted the allocation of taxes to our operating segments in 2009 to reflect this difference the impact of changing our allocation methodology was not significant 

display technologies 

dollars in millions 

 

 2010 vs 2009 

the increase in net sales in 2010 when compared to 2009 reflected an increase in volume of more than 25 measured in square feet of glass sold and the positive impact of 179 million from movements in foreign exchange rates offset by price declines of 8 net sales of this segment are denominated in japanese yen and as a result are susceptible to movements in the us dollarjapanese yen exchange rate volume gains in 2010 were led by strong growth in demand for lcd televisions outside of the united states coupled with a replenishment of this industry’s supply chain 

equity earnings of samsung corning precision in 2010 increased by 32 when compared to 2009 due to volume gains of almost 20 improved manufacturing performance and by the positive impact of 90 million from movements in foreign exchange rates offset somewhat by price declines of 7 equity earnings of samsung corning precision are impacted by movements in both the us dollar  japanese yen and us dollar  korean won exchange rates equity earnings were also positively impacted by a 61 million credit for our share of a revised samsung corning precision tax holiday calculation agreed to by the korean national tax service 

  

when compared to last year the increase in net income in 2010 primarily reflects the impact of the volume increases described above at both our whollyowned business and samsung corning precision and the impact of an insurance settlement for business interruption and property damage insurance claims partially offset by price declines the insurance settlement relates to two events in 2009 which impacted production at our lcd glass manufacturing facilities in august 2009 an earthquake halted production at one of our lcd glass manufacturing facilities in japan and in october 2009 production at our facility in taichung taiwan was impacted by a power disruption we recorded a pretax credit in 2010 in the amount of 324 million as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims related to these two events results also improved due to the absence of 31 million of restructuring charges impacting 2009 net income net income included royalty income from samsung corning precision that was higher in 2010 when compared to last year reflecting the improvements in sales volume at samsung corning precision a number of corning’s patents and knowhow are licensed to samsung corning precision as well as to third parties generating royalty income refer to note 7 investments to the consolidated financial statements for more information about related party transactions net income in 2010 includes the favorable impact of 182 million from movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year 

2009 vs 2008 

the decrease in net sales in 2009 reflected price declines of 19 and a decline in volume of 2 measured in square feet of glass sold offset somewhat by the positive impact of 228 million from movements in foreign exchange rates net sales of this segment are denominated in japanese yen and as a result are susceptible to movements in the us dollarjapanese yen exchange rate when compared to 2008 the volume decline in 2009 occurred largely in the first quarter of 2009 and reflected a number of industry dynamics because corning sells to panel makers and not to end market consumers supply chain expansion and contraction for this industry is a key factor in corning’s volume during the second half of 2008 the lcd market experienced a supply chain contraction that worsened as global economic conditions deteriorated and demand rapidly declined we believe the industry supply chain contraction ended in the first quarter of 2009 followed by replenishment in the second quarter over the remainder of 2009 we saw demand levels for lcd glass increase in comparison to first quarter levels in the fourth quarter of 2009 net sales increased 84 when compared to the same period in 2008 and 6 when compared to the third quarter of 2009 with increasing demand over the course of 2009 we strategically restarted some capacity that had been temporarily idled towards the end of 2008 

as described above in 2009 an earthquake in shizuoka japan halted production at the company’s lcd glass manufacturing facility and production at the company’s lcd glass manufacturing facility in taichung taiwan was impacted by a power disruption incremental production capacity and the ability to resume some manufacturing in our affected facilities helped to ease the impact of both disruptions and support lcd glass shipments we believe our market share was negatively impacted because our capacity was lower during a period when demand remained robust the company incurred approximately 30 million of costs for accelerated depreciation charges and asset writeoffs from these events 

in 2009 equity earnings of samsung corning precision reflected the positive impact of 187 million from movements in foreign exchange rates and an increase in volume of 35 offset somewhat by price declines of 20 when compared to the same period in 2008 equity earnings from samsung corning precision are impacted by movements in both the us dollar  japanese yen and us dollar  korean won exchange rates results of samsung corning precision reflected improvements in the overall lcd glass market which grew approximately 20 in 2009 when compared to 2008 the economic recession had a greater impact on our whollyowned business in taiwan than on samsung corning precision since taiwanese panel makers do not have strong brand recognition they are the first to experience supply chain corrections and slower to benefit from improvements in demand 

when compared to 2008 the decline in net income in 2009 was primarily due to the impact of volume and price declines costs associated with the earthquake in japan and restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2009 these items were offset somewhat by 342 million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates and stronger equity earnings net income of this segment in 2009 included 31 million of restructuring charges associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009 net income also includes royalty income from samsung corning precision which was higher in 2009 when compared to 2008 reflecting the improvements in sales volume at samsung corning precision corning licenses certain of its patents and knowhow to samsung corning precision as well as to third parties which generate royalty income refer to note 7 investments to the consolidated financial statements for more information about related party transactions 

  

other information 

the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan and taiwan for 2010 and 2009 three customers of the display technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for 72 and 62 respectively of total segment sales when combined our customers face the same global economic dynamics as we do in this market while we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues our nearterm sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products 

in addition samsung corning precision’s sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers in 2010 and 2009 sales to two lcd panel makers located in korea accounted for approximately 93 of samsung corning precision sales in each of those two years 

corning has invested heavily to expand capacity to meet the demand for lcd glass substrates in 2010 2009 and 2008 capital spending in this segment was 497 million 552 million and 14 billion respectively we expect capital spending for 2011 to be approximately 12 to 15 billion 

in 2005 and 2004 several of corning’s customers entered into longterm purchase and supply agreements in which corning’s display technologies segment would supply largesize glass substrates to these customers over periods of up to six years as part of the agreements these customers agreed to advance cash deposits to corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased we received our last deposit of 105 million in july 2007 and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements during 2010 2009 and 2008 we issued 83 million 253 million and 266 million respectively in credits that were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due in the event customers do not purchase the agreed upon quantities of product subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits if corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements corning may be required to return certain amounts of our customers’ deposits refer to note 11 other liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

outlook 

we expect the overall lcd glass market in 2011 to be approximately 36 to 38 billion square feet this is an increase over 2010 which was 315 billion square feet demand will be driven by continued growth of lcd televisions particularly in emerging regions such as china we expect industry glass supply and demand to be relatively in balance and quarterly sequential glass price declines to be moderate we believe that the longterm drivers of the lcd market will be lcd television growth driven by increased demand in emerging regions and a faster replacement cycle as well as continued growth in the personal computer market 

in the first quarter of 2011 we expect volume at our whollyowned business and at samsung corning precision to increase by the midsingle digits when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 we expect sequential price declines in the first quarter of 2011 to be more moderate than those in the fourth quarter of 2010 

the end market demand for lcd televisions monitors and notebooks is dependent on consumer retail spending among other things we are cautious about the potential negative impacts that economic conditions particularly the global economic recession and world political tensions could have on consumer demand while the industry has grown rapidly in recent years economic volatility along with consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes prices or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth therefore it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time we may incur further charges in this segment to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity in addition changes in foreign exchange rates principally the japanese yen will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment 

  

telecommunications 

dollars in millions 

 

 2010 vs 2009 

net sales for the segment were up when compared to 2009 higher sales of enterprise network products and optical fiber and cable in north america and europe were offset somewhat by lower sales of fibertothepremises products and optical fiber and cable products in asia as well as the absence of sales from two businesses sold last year sales from the two businesses sold totaled 49 million in 2009 net sales in 2010 were negatively impacted by 11 million from movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year 

the increase in net income in 2010 reflected the absence of restructuring charges from last year volume strength in enterprise network products and the impact of improved manufacturing efficiency and cost reduction efforts net income of this segment in 2009 included 42 million of restructuring charges associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce net income in 2010 includes the favorable impact of 10 million from movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year 

the telecommunications segment has a concentrated customer base in 2010 one customer of the telecommunications segment accounted for 15 of total segment net sales in 2009 one customer of the telecommunications segment accounted for 12 of total segment net sales in 2008 two customers of the telecommunications segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of total segment net sales collectively accounted for 24 of total segment sales when combined 

2009 vs 2008 

in 2009 net sales of this segment decreased when compared to the same period in 2008 and reflected declines across all of our businesses when compared to 2008 lower volumes in both north america and europe were offset somewhat by higher net sales for optical fiber and cable in china as the country continued to expand its telecommunications infrastructure volume in north america and europe reflected the continuing impact of the economic recession in addition net sales of this segment were negatively impacted by 23 million from movements in foreign exchange rates 

for 2009 the decline in net income reflected the volume impacts as described above and the impact of restructuring charges offset somewhat by lower operating expenses resulting from restructuring actions when compared to 2008 net income of this segment included the impact of 42 million of restructuring charges in 2009 associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan actions in this segment included workforce reductions the consolidation of manufacturing operations that resulted in the closure of two plants and the exit of some minor businesses movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of net income for the periods presented 

outlook 

we expect net sales of the telecommunications segment to be up approximately 15 in 2011 driven by an increase in global demand for our fibertothepremises products and enterprise network products as well as from the impact of a small acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2011 in the first quarter of 2011 we expect net sales of this segment to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2010 

changes in our customers’ expected deployment plans or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fibertothepremises products could also affect sales levels should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated our sales and earnings would be adversely affected 

  

environmental technologies 

dollars in millions 

 

  2010 vs 2009 

net sales for the environmental technologies segment in 2010 were up 38 when compared to the previous year and reflected higher volumes of both automotive and diesel products offset somewhat by unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements in 2009 automotive vehicle sales declined with the worldwide recession and production was significantly below vehicle sales volumes as manufacturers and dealers decreased inventories in 2010 as automotive markets in the united states and europe improved and china continued to expand manufacturers and dealers increased inventories and production levels resulting in a 25 increase in automotive production when compared to 2009 diesel product sales increased 54 reflecting an improvement in the truck market in the united states and implementation of governmental regulations in europe net sales of this segment in 2010 were negatively impacted by 11 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the prior year 

net income in 2010 increased due to higher sales volumes and improvements in manufacturing performance offset somewhat by higher freight costs when compared to last year net income in 2010 also reflected the absence of restructuring charges in comparison to the same period last year in 2009 net loss of this segment included 28 million of restructuring charges associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales last year net income in 2010 included the negative impact of 9 million from movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the same periods last year 

the environmental technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of catalyzer and emission control systems manufacturers who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers the use of our substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel vehicle or engine manufacturers for 2010 three customers of the environmental technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment sales accounted for 86 of total segment sales for 2009 and 2008 net sales to those same three customers accounted for 85 and 81 respectively of total segment sales while we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues with our direct customers our nearterm sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products 

2009 vs 2008 

when compared to 2008 net sales for 2009 were negatively impacted by lower automotive production caused by the global recession and subsequent inventory reductions at automotive manufacturers and dealers in the first quarter of 2009 us automotive builds were at their lowest levels since corning entered this business in the first half of 2009 net sales of this segment declined 40 when compared to the first half of 2008 in the second half of 2009 yearoveryear net sales were up 14 when compared to the same period last year due to government incentives in china europe and the us in addition we believe inventories at automotive manufacturers and dealers returned to more normalized levels in the fourth quarter of 2009 which also caused increased demand diesel product sales in 2009 reflected the impact of the recessiondriven weak freight industry in the us this was offset somewhat by improved demand in the second half of 2009 as engine manufacturers prepared for stricter heavy duty diesel emission standards in 2010 net sales in 2009 were negatively impacted by 9 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the same period in 2008 

net loss in 2009 reflected lower sales and manufacturing volume of both automotive and diesel products offset somewhat by lower operating expenses when compared to net income 2008 in addition net loss of this segment in 2009 included the impact of restructuring charges restructuring charges for this segment totaled 28 million for the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to lower sales in 2009 movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the results of this operating segment 

  

outlook 

we expect net sales of this segment to improve by approximately 10 in 2011 due to strong growth in demand for diesel products driven by recovery in the united states freight market and related truck production full implementation of governmental regulations on light duty diesel vehicles in europe and the start of nonroad regulation implementation in the united states in the first quarter of 2011 we expect net sales of this segment to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2010 

specialty materials 

dollars in millions 

 

  2010 vs 2009 

the specialty materials segment manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs consequently this segment operates in a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets that include display optics and components semiconductor optics components aerospace and defense astronomy ophthalmic products telecommunications components and a protective cover glass that is optimized for portable display devices and televisions 

net sales increased in 2010 due to higher sales of corning gorilla glass and an increase in sales of display components and semiconductor optics and components when compared to last year sales of corning gorilla glass have continued to increase as the company moves to capitalize on market opportunities for this product the lower net loss in 2010 was driven by higher sales of our corning gorilla glass products and the absence of restructuring charges offset somewhat by the costs associated with adding capacity the net loss in 2009 included 17 million of restructuring charges for the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in 2010 movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales or net income of this segment 

for 2010 three customers of the specialty materials segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment sales accounted for 43 of total segment sales 

2009 vs 2008 

net sales decreased in 2009 when compared to the prior year due primarily to lower sales of semiconductor optics and components as a result of the significant market downturn offset somewhat by an increase in sales of corning gorilla glass the net loss for 2009 resulted from the decline in net sales along with manufacturing development costs for corning gorilla glass when compared to 2008 the net loss in 2009 also included 17 million of restructuring charges for the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009 and costs associated with closing one of this segment’s manufacturing facilities in 2009 movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the profitability of this segment 

outlook 

for 2011 we expect sales of this segment to increase significantly driven by increased sales of corning gorilla glass when compared to 2010 we expect a modest increase in sales of semiconductor products as the semiconductor industry begins to improve in the first quarter of 2011 we expect net sales to be up 20 to 25 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 due to strong demand for corning gorilla glass 

  

life sciences 

dollars in millions 

 

 2010 vs 2009 

the increase in net sales in 2010 was driven primarily by the acquisition of axygen which was completed in the third quarter of 2009 and a small acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2010 these acquisitions supported the company’s strategy to expand corning’s portfolio of life sciences products and enhance global customer access in this business and accounted for 117 million of the increase in sales in 2010 when compared to 2009 the segment’s existing products lines also showed strong sales growth in 2010 improving 25 million when compared to 2009 the improvement in net income in 2010 reflected the sales increases as described above offset somewhat by higher cost of materials and expenses associated with the integration of axygen net income for 2010 also reflected the absence of restructuring charges when compared to last year for 2009 net income of this segment included 8 million of restructuring charges associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the net sales or net income for this operating segment 

2009 vs 2008 

for 2009 the increase in net sales of this segment reflected sales from the acquisition of axygen which was completed in the third quarter of 2009 offset somewhat by volume declines in the company’s existing life sciences products sales of axygen products were approximately 36 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 for 2009 the decline in net income resulted primarily from acquisitionrelated costs and the impact of 8 million of restructuring charges associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan when compared to the 2008 movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales or net income of this operating segment in 2009 

for 2010 two customers in the life sciences segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of total segment net sales collectively accounted for 37 of total segment sales for 2009 two customers in the life sciences segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of total segment net sales collectively accounted for 45 of total segment sales for 2008 one customer accounted for 45 of total segment sales 

outlook 

sales of the life sciences segment for 2011 are expected to be up approximately 15 when compared to 2010 primarily due to the impact of the acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2010 in the first quarter of 2011 we expect net sales to be up slightly when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010

 2010 vs 2009 

all other includes all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting this group is primarily comprised of development projects that involve the use of various technologies for new products such as advanced flow reactors thinfilm photovoltaics and adjacency businesses in pursuit of thin strong glass this segment also includes results for certain corporate investments such as samsung corning precision’s nonlcd glass businesses eurokera and keraglass equity affiliates which manufacture smooth cooktop glassceramic products and corsam technologies llc corsam an equity affiliate established between corning and samsung corning precision to provide glass technology research refer to note 7 investments for additional information about samsung corning precision and related party transactions 

  

the decrease in the net loss in this segment for 2010 is primarily due to improved equity earnings from corporate investments and lower operating costs offset by the costs of exiting our synthetic green laser program and the startup costs for new business development projects 

2009 vs 2008 

the decrease in this segment’s net loss for 2009 resulted primarily from lower operating expenses as a result of restructuring actions in the first quarter of 2009 cost reduction efforts and the impact of the change in the company’s tax position net loss of this segment for 2009 included 4 million of restructuring charges associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan

capital spending totaled 10 billion 09 billion and 19 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively capital spending in 2010 and 2009 was driven primarily by projects to expand our lcd glass capacity in our display technologies segment capital spending in 2008 primarily included expansion of lcd glass capacity in the display technologies segment and new capacity for diesel products in the environmental technologies segment our 2011 capital spending program is expected to be approximately 24 billion to 27 billion approximately 12 billion to 15 billion will be directed toward our display technologies segment 

in the third quarter of 2010 we announced multiyear investment plans for additional manufacturing capacity that will benefit a number of our segments the plans include 800 million for spending associated with a new lcd glass substrate facility in the people’s republic of china to meet expected growing demand for our lcd glass spending for this facility began in september of this year and we expect production to begin in 2012 additional investments will include construction projects in other regions to expand capacity for eagle xg ® lcd glass substrates and will benefit our specialty materials segment by providing capacity for increased demand of corning gorilla glass the plans also include spending in the environmental technologies segment to expand its existing automotive substrate facilities in shanghai china and kaiserslautern germany additionally the plans establish a life sciences manufacturing and distribution facility in wujiang china these facilities are expected to be operational in 2011 and 2012 

  

cash flows 

summary of cash flow data in millions 

 

 2010 vs 2009 

operating cash flow increased significantly in 2010 when compared to 2009 driven largely by a special dividend of almost 900 million received from samsung corning precision we also recorded a credit in the amount of 324 million as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims and received cash totaling 259 million from our panel of insurance carriers representing a partial payment of this settlement additionally we issued less credits against customer deposits in 2010 when compared to 2009 these positive events were partially offset by higher contributions to our defined benefit pension plan in 2010 and the decrease in cash from changes in working capital 

net cash used in investing activities was higher in 2010 when compared to 2009 due to an increase in shortterm investment purchases and higher capital expenditures offset by lower costs for the acquisition of businesses 

net cash provided by financing activities increased in 2010 primarily due to the increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options offset somewhat by the net cash impact of financing activities 

2009 vs 2008 

although 2009 net income decreased significantly from 2008 operating cash flow declined only slightly the decrease in net income resulted primarily from two nonrecurring noncash items the release of 25 billion of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and a 340 million reduction in asbestos related liabilities when compared to 2008 operating cash flow in 2009 reflected higher pension contributions and restructuring payments offset somewhat by an increase in cash from changes in working capital and higher dividends from equity affiliates 

net cash used in investing activities was lower in 2009 when compared to 2008 due to lower capital expenditures in our display technologies segment offset partially by the acquisition of axygen 

net cash used in financing activities also decreased in 2009 when compared to the prior year due to the issuance of longterm debt and the discontinuation of common stock repurchases 

defined benefit pension plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees our largest single pension plan is corning’s us qualified plan at december 31 2010 this plan accounted for 81 of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation and 91 of the related plans’ assets 

we have historically contributed to the us qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the irs minimum requirements and as a result mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until some time after 2012 in 2010 we made voluntary cash contributions of 350 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and 5 million to our international pension plans in 2009 we made voluntary cash contributions of 75 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and 5 million to our international pension plans 

in 2008 we experienced significant negative returns on our pension assets for our primary defined benefit plan as a result of deteriorating financial market conditions which increased pension expense for 2009 by 33 million in 2009 and 2010 actual investment experience on the pension assets of our primary defined benefit plan was favorable driven by the performance of public equity markets commodities and long duration fixed income securities 

although we will not be subject to any mandatory contributions in 2011 we anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of up to 30 million to our international pension plans in 2011 we do not plan to contribute to our domestic pension plan in 2011 which is sufficiently funded

customer deposits 

certain customers of our display technologies segment have entered into longterm supply agreements and have agreed to make advance cash deposits to secure supply of largesize glass substrates the deposits will be reduced through future product purchases thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods 

between 2004 and 2007 we received a total of 937 million for customer deposit agreements we received our last deposit of 105 million in 2007 and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements 

in 2010 2009 and 2008 we issued credit memoranda which totaled 83 million 253 million and 266 million respectively these credit amounts were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due customer deposit liabilities were 27 million and 104 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively in 2011 we expect to issue approximately 27 million in credit memoranda 

restructuring 

in 2009 we recorded charges of 228 million associated with a corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009 the charge included costs for severance special termination benefits outplacement services asset writeoffs and the impact of a curtailment loss for postretirement benefits total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately 150 million primarily related to termination benefits 

during 2010 2009 and 2008 we made payments of 66 million 89 million and 17 million respectively related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions refer to note 2 restructuring impairment and other credits and charges to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

key balance sheet data 

balance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table dollars in millions 

 

  

 credit ratings 

as of february 10 2011 our credit ratings were as follows 

 

   

management assessment of liquidity 

we ended the fourth quarter of 2010 with over 63 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments the company has adequate sources of liquidity and we are confident in our ability to generate cash to meet existing or reasonably likely future cash requirements our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted at december 31 2010 slightly less than half of the consolidated amount was held outside of the us almost all of the amounts held outside of the us are available for repatriation subject to relevant tax consequences we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed during the fourth quarter of 2010 we repatriated to the us approximately 11 billion of current year earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the repatriation of cash to the us we temporarily borrowed against our unsecured committed revolving line of credit in the fourth quarter of 2010 all amounts borrowed were repaid on december 16 2010 we expect that we will meet additional us liquidity needs through future cash flows use of us cash balances external borrowings or some combination of these sources 

realized gains and losses on availableforsale securities were not significant in 2010 or 2009 in 2008 we recorded 53 million of net realized losses on shortterm investments which represented less than 6 of our total holdings of availableforsale securities at that time refer to note 3 availableforsale investments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

during 2008 we repurchased 295 million shares of common stock for 625 million as part of repurchase programs announced in july 2007 and july 2008 there were no repurchases in 2009 or 2010 

we complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial statements at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk we closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues we currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues 

our major source of funding for 2011 and beyond will be our operating cash flow and our existing balances of cash cash equivalents and short term investments we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations the asbestos litigation research and development capital expenditures scheduled debt repayments and dividend payments corning also has access to a 10 billion unsecured committed revolving line of credit through december 2015 the credit agreement includes two financial covenants a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio at december 31 2010 we were in compliance with both financial covenants 

the required leverage ratio which measures debt to total capital is a maximum of 50 our leverage ratio using this measure was 11 at december 31 2010 and 2009 the required interest coverage ratio which is an adjusted earnings measure as defined by our facility compared to interest expense is a ratio of at least 35 times at december 31 2010 and 2009 our interest coverage ratio using this measure was 402 times and 303 times respectively 

our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events in addition the majority of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision whereby a default on one debt obligation of the company in excess of a specified amount also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument as of december 31 2010 we were in compliance with all such provisions 

other than the 2011 capital spending plan management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands commitments events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in our liquidity in addition other than items discussed there are no known material trends favorable or unfavorable in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources 

off balance sheet arrangements 

off balance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 

corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include the following 

 

    

at the time a guarantee is issued the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant 

refer to note 14 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

corning leases certain transportation equipment from three trusts that qualify as variable interest entities the sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to corning 

for variable interest entities we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of its expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests which are the ownership contractual or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests 

corning has identified three entities that qualify as variable interest entities none of these entities is considered to be significant to corning’s consolidated statements of position 

corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit liquidity or market risk support to that entity 

contractual obligations 

the amounts of our obligations follow in millions 

 

  

        

we are required at the time a guarantee is issued to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant 

we have agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow corning the funding of the dow corning credit facility will be required only if dow corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed bankruptcy plan the purchase obligations primarily represent raw material and energyrelated takeorpay contracts we believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 

environment 

corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 20 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by the agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2010 and 2009 corning had accrued approximately 30 million undiscounted and 26 million undiscounted respectively for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates that required us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates follow 

impairment of assets held for use 

we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified we review our longlived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 

manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals primarily platinum and rhodium these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of longlived assets this review considers all of the company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process in reclamation fabrication or refinement in anticipation of reuse or awaiting use to support increased capacity precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other purposes 

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include 

 

        

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for the majority of our reporting segments we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

for longlived assets when impairment indicators are present we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used assessments also consider changes in asset utilization including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 

the fair value of longlived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of longlived assets and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals some of the more significant estimates and assumptions in our analysis include market size and growth market share projected selling prices manufacturing cost and discount rate our estimates are based upon our historical experience our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our longlived assets were not recoverable at december 31 2010 the fair market value of precious metals was higher than our carrying value by 415 million at december 31 2009 the fair market value of precious metals was higher than our carrying value by 193 million currently these precious metal assets primarily in the display technologies segment are recoverable as part of their asset groupings there is the potential for impairment in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of our segments such events include but are not limited to a significant decrease in demand for products of our display technologies segment or a significant decrease in its profitability 

variable interest entities 

the company has interests in certain unconsolidated entities these investments are evaluated periodically to determine if they qualify as variable interest entities and whether corning is a primary beneficiary for any of those qualifying interests a variable interest entity vie is an entity that lacks sufficient equity investment or in which the equity investors do not have certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest a company that absorbs a majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the expected returns of a vie is considered to be a primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie the determination of whether an entity is a vie and if a company is the primary beneficiary of a vie are complex areas that require judgments about items such as the sufficiency of the equity at risk the evaluation of contractual arrangements and assessments about forecasted information while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate changes in these judgments or estimates could affect corning’s results 

effective january 1 2010 the company adopted required changes to consolidation guidance for variable interest entities that require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise’s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has 1 the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and 2 the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity in addition the required changes provide guidance on shared power and joint venture relationships remove the scope exemption for qualified special purpose entities revise the definition of a variable interest entity and require additional disclosures the adoption of this standard was not material to corning’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

for variable interest entities we routinely assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary corning leases certain transportation equipment from three trusts that qualify as variable interest entities the sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to corning none of these entities is considered significant to corning’s consolidated financial statements 

  

impairment of goodwill 

we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments on a number of matters including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units 

as disclosed in note 10 goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements corning’s goodwill relates primarily to the telecommunications specialty materials and life sciences operating segments our annual goodwill recoverability assessment is completed in the fourth quarter as it is traditionally based on our annual strategic planning process this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the longterm growth of our businesses and forecasting future cash flows our valuation method is an “income approach” using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return our estimates are based upon our historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends periodically the detailed determination of fair value is carried forward from one year to the next if certain criteria are met in 2010 an assessment of all of the reporting units was performed and it was determined the criteria to carry forward the detailed determination of fair value were met as follows 

 

   telecommunications 

goodwill for the telecommunications segment is tested at the operating segment level we have aggregated the telecommunications operating segment businesses into a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment reviews based on the manner in which we operate our businesses the vertically integrated nature of these operations shared assets operating and finance resources and management the nature of production processes and the regulatory environment and the shared support and benefit from common research and development activity 

results for the telecommunications segment in 2010 were up when compared with 2009 we anticipate higher sales in 2011 as demand increases for fibertothehome products and outside plant cable products in 2010 the results of our review of the telecommunications segment was in line with our expectations for the longterm growth of this business as compared with our 2009 evaluation which indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceed its book value by a significant amount a discount rate of 9 was used in 2009 a range of 7 to 11 would not have changed our conclusion 

specialty materials 

goodwill for the specialty materials segment is tested at the component level which is one level below an operating segment because the goodwill is the result of transactions associated with certain businesses in this operating segment although the specialty materials segment had small reported losses in 2010 and 2009 we anticipate growth in new products will improve longerterm profitability in 2010 the results of our review of the specialty materials segment was in line with our expectations for the longterm growth of this business as compared with our 2009 evaluation which indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceed its book value by a significant amount a discount rate of 9 was used in 2009 a range of 7 to 11 would not have changed our conclusion 

life sciences 

goodwill for the life sciences segment is tested at the operating segment level we have aggregated the life sciences operating segment businesses into a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing based on the manner in which we operate our businesses 

results in the life sciences segment in 2010 were up when compared to 2009 reflecting the positive impact of axygen an acquisition which was completed in the third quarter of 2009 in 2010 the results of our review of the life sciences segment was in line with our expectations for the longterm growth of this business as compared with our 2009 evaluation which indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceed its book value by a significant amount a discount rate of 8 was used in 2009 a range of 6 to 10 would not have changed our conclusion 

  

restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions 

we are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including for example employee termination costs restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses of portions thereof their profitability cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome the judgment involved can be difficult subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses 

restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which as a result require impairment we are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned 

income taxes 

we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environments in which we do business it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances 

in the second quarter of 2008 we released 24 billion of valuation allowances because we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient levels of profitability in the us to realize substantially all of our us deferred tax assets a key trend included in our projections was the rate of penetration of lcd televisions driven by an increase in televisions per household faster lcd television replacement rates the continued decline of cathode ray tube products and growth in emerging markets such as china another key trend included global demand improvements for diesel products based on the timing of new government regulations and economic growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 we released an additional 70 million and 45 million respectively of valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets as a result of a change in our estimate of us taxable income 

significant estimates and assumptions used in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets included the longterm stabilization of us income from forecasted royalty income in our display technologies operating segment the longterm growth of our diesel business and the future success of new products 

equity method investments 

at december 31 2010 and 2009 the carrying value of our equity method investments was 44 billion and 40 billion respectively with our two largest equity method investments comprising approximately 95 of the balance we review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if an event or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be otherthantemporarily impaired when such indicators are present we then perform an indepth review for impairment an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability forecasted tax rates foreign currency exchange rate movements terminal value assumptions historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends 

as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable 

fair value measures 

as required corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the company’s own market assumptions once inputs have been characterized we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement in addition observable market data must be used when available corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are shortterm and longterm investments pension asset investments and derivatives these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions 

  

derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in arriving at the fair value of corning’s derivative assets and liabilities we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction amounts related to credit risk are not material 

probability of litigation outcomes 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter case law and other casespecific issues see part ii – item 3 legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face the most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability including the inherent complexity of a chapter 11 filing our history of success in defending asbestos claims our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses and our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants’ representatives the proposed asbestos resolution amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies the approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is not certain and faces objections by some parties any approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is subject to appeal for these and other reasons corning’s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters the estimate of the cost of resolving the nonpcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning’s financial statements is remote 

other possible liabilities 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters including certain tax planning and environmental matters these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 

pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb 

pension and opeb costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates benefits earned interest cost expected return on plan assets mortality rates and other factors actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 

as of december 31 2010 the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was 27 billion 

the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans 

 

 the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning’s funding requirements 

in addition at december 31 2010 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders’ equity by 94 million before tax and a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders’ equity by 91 million in addition the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate 

  

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to corning’s us opeb plans 

 

 the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned in certain instances revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns allowances discounts and other factors these estimates are supported by historical data while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning’s future results

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects 

 

  we have foreign currency exposure to many currencies including the japanese yen euro new taiwan dollar and korean won we selectively enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with durations generally 18 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases these hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions the objective of these contracts is to reduce the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or corning enter into lending situations generally on an intercompany basis denominated in currencies other than their local currency we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes corning uses derivative instruments forwards to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and as such are referred to as undesignated hedges changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities are recorded in current period earnings in other income expense net in the consolidated statements of income 

equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations equity in earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments were 20 billion and 14 billion in 2010 and 2009 respectively with foreignbased affiliates comprising over 77 of this amount in 2010 equity earnings from samsung corning precision totaled 15 billion for 2010 and 11 billion for 2009 exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies 

we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2010 we had open forward contracts and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements all of which were designated as hedges at december 31 2010 a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 360 million compared to 278 million at december 31 2009 specific to the japanese yen a 10 adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 272 million compared to 131 million at december 31 2009 specific to the euro a 10 adverse movement in quoted euro exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 83 million compared to 107 million at december 31 2009 

as we derive approximately 74 of our net sales from outside the us our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies most notably the japanese yen and euro our forecasts generally assume exchange rates during 2011 remain constant at january 2011 levels as an example of impact changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our financial results we compare 2010 actual sales in yen and euro transaction currencies at an average currency exchange rate during the year to a 10 change in the currency exchange rate a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2010 net sales of approximately 308 million a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2010 net sales of approximately 56 million using 2010 net income attributable to corning incorporated as a percentage of net sales of 54 we can estimate that a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2010 net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately 170 million a plus or minus 10 movement in the us dollar – euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2010 net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately 30 million

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report or otherwise have a detrimental affect on the company these risks should be considered in making any investment decisions in corning future results could be materially affected by general industry and market conditions changes in laws or accounting rules general economic and political conditions including a global economic slowdown fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates terrorism political unrest or international conflicts political instability or major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this annual report additional risks not described above or unknown to us may also adversely affect corning or its results 

as a result of the recession in the economies of the united states and many other countries and volatility and uncertainty in global capital and credit markets a number of the risks we normally face may increase in both our consolidated operations and at our equity method investments these include 

 

       our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or circumstances of one or more key customers leading to the substantial reduction in orders for our products 

in 2009 corning’s ten largest customers accounted for 52 of our sales 

  

in addition a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in the majority of our reportable operating segments for 2009 three customers of the display technologies segment accounted for 62 of total segment net sales when combined in the telecommunications segment one customer accounted for 12 of segment net sales in the environmental technologies segment three customers accounted for 85 of total segment sales in aggregate in the life sciences segment two distributors accounted for 45 of segment sales in 2009 as a result of mergers and consolidations between customers corning’s customer base could become more concentrated 

samsung corning precision’s sales were also concentrated in 2009 with sales to two lcd panel makers located in south korea accounting for approximately 93 of total samsung corning precision sales 

the sale of lcd glass substrates in 2009 and previous years provide no assurance that positive trends will continue our customers are lcd panel and color filter makers as they switch to larger size glass the pace of their orders may be uneven while they adjust their manufacturing processes and facilities additionally consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes designs price or other seasonal factors may lead to pauses in market growth from time to time our customers may not be able to maintain their profitability or access sufficient capital to fund routine maintenance and operations or planned expansions which may limit their pace of orders to us emerging material technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications resulting in a decline in demand for our lcd products technologies for displays in competition with lcd panels may reduce or eliminate the need for our glass substrates these technologies may include organic light emitting diodes and plasma display panels new process technologies developed by our competitors may also place us at a cost or quality disadvantage our inability to manufacture glass substrates in the sizes and quantities needed by our customers may result in loss of revenue margins and profits or liabilities for failure to supply a scarcity of resources limitations on technology personnel or other factors resulting in a failure to produce commercial quantities of very large size glass substrates particularly from facilities at a major customer in japan could have adverse financial consequences to us 

our telecommunications segment customers’ purchases of our products are affected by their capital expansion plans general market and economic uncertainty and regulatory changes including broadband policy sales in the telecommunications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of fibertothepremises deployments by our customers such as verizon communications inc our sales will be dependent on planned targets for homes passed and connected changes in our customers’ deployment plans could adversely affect future sales in any quarter or for the full year 

in the environmental technologies segment sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for automotive and diesel emissions and pollution control are expected to fluctuate with vehicle production changes in governmental laws and regulations for air quality and emission controls may also influence future sales sales in our environmental technologies segment are mainly to three catalyzers and emission system component manufacturers our customers sell these systems to automotive original equipment manufacturers and diesel engine manufacturers sales within this segment may be affected by adverse developments in the global vehicle or us freight hauling industries or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicle sales or downturns in freight traffic 

sales in our specialty materials segment track worldwide economic cycles and our customers’ responses to that cycle 

sales in our life sciences segment are through two large distributors and the remaining balance is to a variety of government entities pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies hospitals universities and other research facilities in 2009 our two largest distributors accounted for 45 of life sciences’ segment sales changes in our distribution arrangements in this segment may adversely affect this segment’s financial results 

if the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate demand for our products may decline which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial performance 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies evolving industry or government standards and new product introductions our success is expected to depend in substantial part on the successful introduction of new products or upgrades of current products and our ability to compete with new technologies the following factors related to our products and markets if not achieved could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

 

       

   we face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely affect our financial performance 

we face pricing pressure in each of our leading businesses as a result of intense competition emerging new technologies or overcapacity while we will work toward reducing our costs to offset pricing pressures we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or to sustain our current rate of cost reduction we anticipate pricing pressures will continue into 2010 and beyond in all our businesses 

we face risks related to our international operations and sales 

we have customers and significant operations including manufacturing and sales located outside the us we have large manufacturing operations for liquid crystal display glass substrates in taiwan japan and korea including an equity investment in samsung corning precision operating in south korea that makes glass substrates for the korean lcd market all of our display segment customers are located in the asiapacific region as a result of these and other international operations we face a number of risks including 

 

          any of these items could cause our sales or profitability to be significantly reduced 

additionally a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our display technologies segment is concentrated in three overseas countries and it is reasonably possible that the use of one or more such facilities could be disrupted due to the specialized nature of the assets and the customers’ locations it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from facilities in other countries accordingly loss of these facilities could produce a nearterm severe impact on our display business and the company as a whole 

we face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations 

because we have significant customers and operations outside the us fluctuations in foreign currencies especially the japanese yen new taiwan dollar korean won and euro affect our sales and profit levels foreign exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the us dollar and japanese yen sales in our display technologies segment representing 45 of corning’s sales in 2009 are denominated in japanese yen if sales grow in our display technologies segment that will increase our exposure to currency fluctuations corning hedges significant transaction and balance sheet currency exposures and uses derivatives instruments to limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities as well as operating results although we selectively hedge these items changes in exchange rates especially the japanese yen to us dollar may significantly impact our reported revenues and profits 

if the financial condition of our customers declines our credit risks could increase 

although we have a rigorous process to administer credit and believe our reserve is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable if our customers or our indirect customers fail to meet their payment obligations for our products we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amounts reserved some customers of our display technologies segment are thinly capitalized andor marginally profitable in our environmental technologies segment the us auto makers and certain of their suppliers have encountered credit downgrades or have filed for bankruptcy protection these factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business as of december 31 2009 reserves and allowances for trade receivables totaled approximately 20 million 

  

if we do not successfully adjust our manufacturing volumes and fixed cost structure or achieve manufacturing yields or sufficient product reliability our operating results and cash flow could suffer and we may not achieve anticipated profitability levels 

investments in additional manufacturing capacity of certain businesses including liquid crystal display glass and diesel emission substrates and filters present challenges we may face technical and process issues in moving to commercial production and there can be no assurance that corning will be able to pace its capacity expansion to the actual demand economic results may adversely affect our ability to complete planned capacity expansion and products it is possible that manufacturing capacity may exceed or lag customer demand during certain periods 

the manufacturing of our products involves highly complex and precise processes requiring production in highly controlled and dustfree environments changes in our manufacturing processes could significantly reduce our manufacturing yields and product reliability in some cases existing manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the requirements of our customers we will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to achieve targeted volume pricing and cost levels that will permit profitable operations while we continue to fund projects to improve our manufacturing techniques and processes we may not achieve satisfactory cost levels in our manufacturing activities that will fully satisfy our profitability targets 

our future financial performance depends on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials precious metals parts and manufacturing equipment components to meet the demands of our customers 

our ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials precious metals parts and components from our suppliers we may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages there can be no assurances that we will not encounter these problems in the future furthermore certain manufacturing equipment raw materials or components are available only from a single source or limited sources we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner a reduction interruption or delay of supply or a significant increase in the price for supplies such as manufacturing equipment precious metals raw materials or energy could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

we have incurred and may in the future incur restructuring and other charges the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately 

we have recorded several charges for restructuring impairment of assets and the writeoff of cost and equitybased investments as a result of the decline in the economy and its impact on corning’s businesses we recorded restructuring charges of 228 million in 2009 certain of our equity affiliates have also recorded restructuring charges we and our affiliates may have additional actions that result in restructuring charges in the future 

we have incurred and may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 

at december 31 2009 corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of 676 million while we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe or if acquisitions made by the company fail to achieve expected returns 

if our products including materials purchased from our suppliers experience performance issues our business will suffer 

our business depends on the production of products of consistently high quality our products components and materials purchased from our suppliers are typically tested for quality these testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios for various reasons our products including materials purchased from our suppliers may fail to perform as expected in some cases product redesigns or additional expense may be required to correct a defect a significant or systemic product failure could result in customer relations problems lost sales and financial damages 

we face competition in most of our businesses 

we expect that we will face additional competition from existing competitors low cost manufacturers and new entrants we must invest in research and development expand our engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities and continue to improve customer service and support in order to remain competitive we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position 

  

changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors some of which are outside of our control including 

 

      in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals 

accounting and disclosure rules may affect financial results 

generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations for many areas of our business such as revenue recognition accounting for investments and accounting for stock options are very complex and involve significant and sometimes subjective judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantly impact our reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures in the future without a corresponding change in our cash flows 

we rely on key personnel and the loss of their services or the inability to attract and retain them may negatively affect our businesses 

our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified research and development engineering and operating personnel generally and during periods of rapid growth especially in those of our businesses focused on new products and advanced manufacturing processes is essential to our business success we also depend on the services of experienced key senior management 

the loss of the services of any of our key research and development engineering or operational personnel or senior management without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance 

we are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations 

our manufacturing process generates chemical waste waste water and other industrial waste and various green house gases at various stages in the manufacturing process and we are currently or may be in the future subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of such substances we have installed various types of antipollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our various facilities we have taken steps to affect the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations however we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that the local or national governments will not take steps toward adopting more stringent environment standards 

any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us or the suspensioncessation of production or operations in addition environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the us and other countries such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and co 2 abatement may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by among other things substantially increasing manufacturing costs limiting availability of scarce resources especially energy or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers 

  

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses we cannot assure you that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors changes in laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to protect our intellectual property litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently uncertain and the outcome is often unpredictable other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios 

the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products we are and may in the future be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation that may result in loss of revenue require us to incur substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us we cannot assure you as to the outcome of any such claims 

current or future litigation may harm our financial condition or results of operations 

pending threatened or future litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes expenses and costs exceeding amounts estimated or insured in particular we have been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos and adverse rulings in such lawsuits or the inability to successfully resolve such matters may adversely affect the company as described in legal proceedings a new pcc plan of reorganization was filed with the bankruptcy court on january 29 2009 proposing a resolution of pcc asbestos claims it remains reasonably possible that changes to the amended pcc plan may be negotiated and the elements of the plan and its approval are subject to a number of contingencies before the resolution outlined in the plan becomes final 

we face risks through our equity method investments in companies that we do not control 

corning’s net income includes significant equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended december 31 2009 we recognized 14 billion of equity earnings of which 98 came from our two largest investments dow corning which makes silicone and high purity polycrystalline products and samsung corning precision which primarily makes liquid crystal display glass samsung corning precision is located in the asiapacific region and is subject to political and geographic risks mentioned above as well as business and other risks within the display segment our equity investments may not continue to perform at the same levels as in recent years in 2007 we recognized equity losses associated with samsung corning co ltd a 50 equity method investment that made glass panels and funnels for conventional televisions which recorded fixed asset and other impairment charges dow corning emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2004 and has certain obligations under its plan of reorganization to resolve and fund claims of its creditors and personal injury claimants dow corning may incur further bankruptcy charges in the future which may adversely affect its operations or assets 

we may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us 

we face the risk of loss resulting from product liability securities fiduciary liability intellectual property antitrust contractual warranty environmental fraud and other lawsuits whether or not such claims are valid in addition our product liability fiduciary directors and officers property including business interruption natural catastrophe and comprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect in the future our insurance costs can be volatile and at any time can increase given changes in market supply and demand and our claim history we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs a successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us to pay substantial sums some of the carriers in our primary and excess insurance programs are in liquidation and may not be able to respond if we should have claims reaching into their layers the financial health of other insurers may deteriorate several of our insurance carriers are litigating with us the extent if any of their obligation to provide insurance coverage for asbestos liabilities asserted against us the results of that litigation may adversely affect our insurance coverage for those risks in addition we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain types of risk such as political risks terrorism or war 

our businesses may be subject to increased regulatory enforcement 

some of our business segments operate in industries with a concentrated number of competitors and customers both foreign and domestic while we have adopted a corporatewide compliance program we may become the subject of antitrust or other governmental investigations from many jurisdictions that may adversely impact our reputation or our ability to make and sell products in the future

additional information in response to item 1 is found in note 20 operating segments to the consolidated financial statements and in item 6 selected financial data 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

we operate approximately 60 manufacturing plants and processing facilities of which approximately onehalf are located in the us we own substantially all of our executive and corporate buildings which are located in corning new york we also own substantially all of our research and development facilities and the majority of our manufacturing facilities we own approximately 23 of our sales and administrative facilities while the remaining portion are leased facilities 

for the years ended 2009 2008 and 2007 we invested a total of 41 billion primarily in facilities outside of the us in our display technologies segment of the 890 million spent in 2009 approximately half was for facilities outside the us 

manufacturing sales and administrative and research and development facilities have an aggregate floor space of approximately 24 million square feet distribution of this total area follows 

 

 total assets and capital expenditures by operating segment are included in note 20 operating segments to the consolidated financial statements information concerning lease commitments is included in note 14 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements 

as a result of a decline in demand for our lcd glass in the second half of 2008 we had temporarily idled more than half of our manufacturing capacity in the display technologies segment by the end of 2008 a large portion of this capacity was brought back online in 2009 to meet an increase in demand and to replace existing capacity when needed 

since 2002 we have had excess manufacturing capacity in our telecommunications segment and have not utilized a portion of space in the facilities listed above the largest unused portion is our optical fiber manufacturing facility in concord north carolina that was mothballed in 2002 as a result of lowered demand of optical fiber products in 2007 we reopened a portion of the concord north carolina facility as a result of volume growth in the optical fiber market 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

environmental litigation corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 21 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by such agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2009 corning had accrued approximately 26 million undiscounted for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 

dow corning bankruptcy corning and dow chemical each own 50 of the common stock of dow corning in may 1995 dow corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousands of breast implant product lawsuits on june 1 2004 dow corning emerged from chapter 11 with a plan of reorganization the plan which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims the plan also includes releases for corning and dow chemical as shareholders in exchange for contributions to the plan 

  

under the terms of the plan dow corning has established and is funding a settlement trust and a litigation facility to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate their claims inclusive of insurance dow corning has paid approximately 16 billion to the settlement trust as of december 31 2009 dow corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of 16 billion and anticipates insurance receivables of 16 million as a separate matter arising from the bankruptcy proceedings dow corning is defending claims asserted by a number of commercial creditors who claim additional interest at default rates and enforcement costs during the period from may 1995 through june 2004 as of december 31 2009 dow corning has estimated the liability to commercial creditors to be within the range of 83 million to 260 million as dow corning management believes no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range dow corning has recorded the minimum liability within the range should dow corning not prevail in this matter corning’s equity earnings would be reduced by its 50 share of the amount in excess of 83 million net of applicable tax benefits in addition the london market insurers the lmi claimants have claimed a reimbursement right with respect to a portion of insurance proceeds previously paid by the lmi claimants to dow corning this claim is based on a theory that the lmi claimants overestimated dow corning’s liability for the resolution of implant claims pursuant to the plan the lmi claimants offered two calculations of their claim amount 54 million and 93 million plus minimum interest of 67 million and 116 million respectively these estimates were explicitly characterized as preliminary and subject to change litigation regarding this claim is in the discovery stage dow corning disputes the claim and is unable to reasonably estimate any potential liability there are a number of other claims in the bankruptcy proceedings against dow corning awaiting resolution by the us district court and it is reasonably possible that dow corning may record bankruptcyrelated charges in the future there are no remaining tort claims against corning other than those that will be channeled by the plan into facilities established by the plan or otherwise defended by the litigation facility 

pittsburgh corning corporation corning and ppg industries inc ppg each own 50 of the capital stock of pittsburgh corning corporation pcc over a period of more than two decades pcc and several other defendants have been named in numerous lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos on april 16 2000 pcc filed for chapter 11 reorganization in the us bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania at the time pcc filed for bankruptcy protection there were approximately 11800 claims pending against corning in state court lawsuits alleging various theories of liability based on exposure to pcc’s asbestos products and typically requesting monetary damages in excess of one million dollars per claim corning has defended those claims on the basis of the separate corporate status of pcc and the absence of any facts supporting claims of direct liability arising from pcc’s asbestos products corning is also currently involved in approximately 10400 other cases approximately 38800 claims alleging injuries from asbestos and similar amounts of monetary damages per case those cases have been covered by insurance without material impact to corning to date as described below several of corning’s insurance carriers have filed a legal proceeding concerning the extent of any insurance coverage for these claims asbestos litigation is inherently difficult and past trends in resolving these claims may not be indicators of future outcomes 

on march 28 2003 corning announced that it had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the resolution of all current and future asbestos claims against it and pcc which might arise from pcc products or operations the 2003 plan the 2003 plan would have required corning to relinquish its equity interest in pcc contribute its equity interest in pittsburgh corning europe nv pce a belgian corporation contribute 25 million shares of corning common stock and pay a total of 140 million in six annual installments present value 131 million at march 2003 beginning one year after the plan’s effective date with 55 percent interest from june 2004 in addition the 2003 plan provided that corning would assign certain insurance policy proceeds from its primary insurance and a portion of its excess insurance 

on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court issued an order denying confirmation of the 2003 plan for reasons it set out in a memorandum opinion several parties including corning filed motions for reconsideration these motions were argued on march 5 2007 and the bankruptcy court reserved decision 

on january 10 2008 some of the parties in the proceeding advised the bankruptcy court that they had made substantial progress on a proposed amended plan of reorganization the amended pcc plan that resolved issues raised by the court in denying the confirmation of the 2003 plan and that would therefore make it unnecessary for the bankruptcy court to decide the motion for reconsideration on march 27 2008 and may 22 2008 the parties further informed the bankruptcy court on the progress toward the amended pcc plan the parties filed a partial tentative plan on august 8 2008 the parties continued to inform the bankruptcy court of the status of their discussions on the amended pcc plan the complete amended pcc plan and its ancillary documents were filed with the bankruptcy court on january 29 2009 

  

as a result corning believes the amended pcc plan now represents the most probable outcome of this matter and expects that the amended pcc plan will be confirmed by the court at the same time corning believes the 2003 plan no longer serves as the basis for the company’s best estimate of liability key provisions of the amended pcc plan address the concerns expressed by the bankruptcy court accordingly in the first quarter of 2008 corning adjusted its asbestos litigation liability to reflect components of the amended pcc plan the proposed resolution of pcc asbestos claims under the amended pcc plan requires corning to contribute its equity interests in pcc and pce and to contribute a fixed series of payments recorded at present value corning will have the option to use its shares rather than cash to make these payments but the liability is fixed by dollar value and not the number of shares the amended pcc plan would require corning to make 1 one payment of 100 million one year from the date the amended pcc plan becomes effective and certain conditions are met and 2 five additional payments of 50 million on each of the five subsequent anniversaries of the first payment the final payment of which is subject to reduction based on the application of credits under certain circumstances 

the amended pcc plan does not include nonpcc asbestos claims that may be or have been raised against corning corning has recorded an additional 150 million for such claims in its estimated asbestos litigation liability the liability for nonpcc claims was estimated based upon industry data for asbestos claims since corning does not have recent claim history due to the injunction issued by the bankruptcy court the estimated liability represents the undiscounted projection of claims and related legal fees over the next 20 years the amount may need to be adjusted in future periods as more companyspecific data becomes available 

the amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies payment of the amounts required to fund the amended pcc plan from insurance and other sources are subject to a number of conditions which may not be achieved the approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is not certain and faces objections by some parties any approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is subject to appeal the amended pcc plan is subject to a vote of pcc’s creditors for these and other reasons corning’s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters the estimate of the cost of resolving the nonpcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning’s financial statements is remote 

several of corning’s insurers have commenced litigation for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies including rights that may be affected by the potential resolutions described above corning is vigorously contesting these cases management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation and therefore cannot estimate the range of any possible loss 

seoul guarantee insurance co and other creditors against samsung group and affiliates prior to their merger samsung corning precision glass co ltd samsung corning precision and samsung corning co ltd samsung corning were two of approximately thirty codefendants in a lawsuit filed by seoul guarantee insurance co and thirteen other creditors sgi and creditors for alleged breach of an agreement that approximately twentyeight affiliates of the samsung group samsung affiliates entered into with sgi and creditors on august 24 1999 the agreement the lawsuit is pending in the courts of south korea under the agreement it is alleged that the samsung affiliates agreed to sell certain shares of samsung life insurance co ltd sli which had been transferred to sgi and creditors in connection with the petition for court receivership of samsung motor inc in the lawsuit sgi and creditors allege a breach of the agreement by the samsung affiliates and are seeking the loss of principal approximately 195 billion for loans extended to samsung motors inc default interest and a separate amount for breach on january 31 2008 the seoul district court ordered the samsung affiliates to pay approximately 130 billion by disposing of 2334045 shares of sli less 1165955 shares of sli previously sold by sgi and creditors and paying the proceeds to sgi and creditors to satisfy any shortfall by participating in the purchase of equity or subordinate debentures issued by them and pay default interest of 6 per annum the ruling has been appealed on november 10 2009 the appellate court directed the parties to attempt to resolve this matter through mediation as a result the parties are discussing the possibility of a settlement of this matter due to the uncertainties around the financial impact to each of the respective samsung affiliates samsung corning precision is unable to reasonably estimate the amount of potential loss if any associated with this case and therefore no provision for such loss is reflected in its financial statements other than as described above no claim in these matters has been asserted against corning or any of its affiliates

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

organization of information 

management’s discussion and analysis provides a historical and prospective narrative on the company’s financial condition and results of operations this discussion includes the following sections 

 

        overview 

corning delivered strong operating results in 2009 in spite of the recession that followed last year’s global economic decline and financial market disruption although results for most of our operating segments were down when compared to last year we saw demand for display technologies products increase as the year progressed and some strength in our other segments as well government incentives helped to improve results in the environmental technologies segment in the second half of the year results in the telecommunications segment reflected strength in demand for optical fiber and cable products in china in the life sciences segment we completed the acquisition of axygen bioscience inc to support our strategy to expand our portfolio of products and enhance global customer access in this business we saw an increase in sales of corning gorilla ® glass our protective cover glass that is optimized for portable display devices we ended the year on a positive note as sales in most of our segments continued to improve in the fourth quarter of 2009 when compared to the third quarter of 2009 net income although substantially lower than the previous year reflected a number of nonoperating items in 2008 that were not repeated in the current year those items are described more fully in the discussion of our profitability below 

in the second half of 2008 and in early 2009 the company responded to a decline in demand by scaling back manufacturing operations reducing research development and engineering expenses reducing capital spending and reducing operating costs in 2009 we recorded restructuring charges totaling 228 million for costs associated with workforce reductions in all of our operating segments 

we faced other challenges this past year as well in august an earthquake halted production at one of the company’s lcd glass manufacturing facilities in japan in midoctober production at our lcd glass manufacturing facility in taichung taiwan was impacted by a power disruption production capacity in taiwan and our ability to quickly resume some manufacturing helped to ease the impact of both of these disruptions 

corning remains committed to a strategy of growing through global innovation while preserving our financial independence this strategy has served us well our key priorities for 2009 are similar to those of the previous four years protect our financial health and invest in the future during 2009 we made the following progress on these priorities 

financial health 

despite the uncertainty in the global economic environment our financial position remained sound and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities significant items in 2009 included the following 

 

   profitability 

for the year ended december 31 2009 we generated net income of 20 billion or 128 per share compared to net income of 53 billion or 332 per share for 2008 when compared to last year the decline in net income was due largely to the following items 

 

   

   the decrease in net income in 2009 was offset somewhat by 393 million from the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates along with lower operating expenses resulting from the company’s restructuring activities 

investing in our future 

we continue to focus on the future and on what we do best  creating and making keystone components that enable hightechnology systems while our spending levels for research development and engineering were lower in 2009 when compared to 2008 we remain committed to investing in research development and engineering to drive innovation we continue to work on technologies for glass substrates for active matrix lcds diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that enable fibertothepremises we continue to make investments in promising technologies such as the epic™ system synthetic green lasers and advanced flow reactors in 2010 we are broadening our innovation strategy to include a focus on opportunities that are adjacent or closely related to our existing capabilities these opportunities which include products such as gorilla ® glass for consumer products and thinfilm photovoltaics for solar applications leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes with slight modifications 

our research development and engineering expenditures decreased by 64 million in 2009 when compared to 2008 but remained somewhat constant as a percentage of net sales reduced spending in 2009 was driven primarily by the impact of restructuring actions and cost reduction efforts we believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies 

our capital expenditures have been focused on expanding manufacturing capacity in the display technologies segment in anticipation of a larger display market in 2010 and growing demand for corning’s gorilla ® glass in december 2007 we announced a 5year capital expenditure plan to locate a glass manufacturing facility at sharp corporation’s plant in sakai city japan we continued to advance this project to align with sharp corporation’s progress on their adjoining facility and in october of 2009 the facility was opened in february 2008 we announced a 453 million expansion of our lcd manufacturing facility in taichung taiwan given the dramatic changes to the global economic landscape and the decline in demand for our products in late 2008 we stopped further expansion in taiwan total capital expenditures for 2009 were 890 million approximately 552 million was directed toward our display technologies segment in 2009 of which about 525 million related to construction in 2008 approximately 51 million in 2009 was invested in our environmental technologies segment 

we expect our 2010 capital spending to be about 600 million to 700 million but there could also be up to 300 million of additional spending for adjacent opportunities possible capacity in china and precious metals to support growing capacity approximately 250 million to 350 million will be directed toward our display technologies segment 

corporate outlook 

our outlook for 2010 is favorable although we believe our sales and profitability will continue to be buffeted by the difficult global economic climate we believe worldwide demand for lcd glass will continue to increase we expect sales in 2010 to be higher than 2009 driven by continued strength in demand for lcd televisions computer notebooks and desktop monitors we believe gross margin will expand driven by improvements in the display and environmental technologies segments we think equity earnings will improve as well we expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in line with recent years we will monitor the levels of recovery in certain of our businesses and we may incur further charges to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity where necessary we will continue to focus on protecting our financial health controlling our costs and accelerating new products while maintaining our emphasis on research and development investments for longer term growth we may take advantage of acquisition opportunities that support the longterm strategies of our businesses such as our recent purchase of axygen we remain confident that our strategy to grow through global innovation while preserving our financial stability will enable our continued longterm success 

  

results of operations 

selected highlights from our continuing operations follow dollars in millions 

 

  

 net sales 

net sales in 2009 decreased 9 due to lower sales in the majority of our segments when compared to 2008 driven primarily by volume and price declines in the display technologies segment offset somewhat by 194 million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates the largest portion of the net sales decline occurred in the first quarter of 2009 as lcd glass demand fell rapidly in response to worsening economic conditions over the remainder of 2009 we saw demand levels for lcd glass increase in comparison to first quarter levels and we believe a corresponding expansion in the lcd industry supply chain as demand for lcd televisions improved in the fourth quarter of 2009 net sales increased 41 when compared to the same period last year and 4 when compared to the third quarter of 2009 driven by increased net sales in the display technologies segment for the full year of 2009 lower volume in the environmental technologies and telecommunications segments also contributed to the decline in net sales as demand for automotive products declined and spending for telecommunications networks contracted 

net sales in 2008 were up slightly when compared to 2007 primarily due to the positive impact of 354 million from the movement in foreign exchange rates offset by volume and price declines in a number of our segments as sales results followed the changing global economic conditions in 2008 net sales for the first half of 2008 were up 21 when compared with the first half of 2007 but down 16 for the second half of 2008 when compared to the second half of 2007 as the lcd glass market experienced a supply chain contraction that worsened with deteriorating economic conditions declines in consumer spending reduced demand for lcd televisions and monitors and automotive products in the second half of 2008 

in 2009 net sales into international markets continued to surpass those into the us market for 2009 net sales into international markets accounted for 76 of net sales for 2008 and 2007 net sales into international markets accounted for 74 and 72 respectively of net sales 

  

cost of sales 

the types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are raw materials consumption including direct and indirect materials salaries wages and benefits depreciation and amortization production utilities productionrelated purchasing warehousing including receiving and inspection repairs and maintenance interlocation inventory transfer costs production and warehousing facility property insurance rent for production facilities and other production overhead 

gross margin 

for 2009 gross margin in dollars and as a percentage of net sales declined when compared to 2008 due primarily to the impact of price declines in the display technologies segment and reduced volume in the environmental technologies and telecommunications segments as a percentage of net sales gross margin of 27 in the first quarter of 2009 reflected the sharp decline in net sales as first quarter lcd glass demand continued to fall in response to worsening economic conditions as a percentage of net sales gross margin approximated 41 in the second third and fourth quarters of 2009 and reflected improved demand in a number of our businesses 

for 2008 gross margin in dollars and as a percentage of net sales was relatively even when compared with 2007 although gross margin was comparable on a full year basis in 2008 our gross margin percent remained above 47 in each of the first three quarters and then fell to 28 in the fourth quarter the decline in gross margin in the fourth quarter resulted from significantly lower volume in our display technologies telecommunications and environmental technologies segments the impact of excess idle capacity costs and accelerated depreciation as we idled the manufacturing capacity in our display technologies segment by more than 50 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses in dollars for 2009 were down slightly when compared to 2008 due primarily to the favorable impact of cost reduction efforts and restructuring actions in 2009 offset somewhat by an increase in performancebased compensation costs as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses in 2009 were up slightly because the rate of decline in sales exceeded the rate of decline in spending for selling general and administrative costs 

the slight decrease in selling general and administrative expenses for 2008 when compared to 2007 in dollars resulted from a decrease in performancebased compensation costs caused by the impact of the decline in profitability in most of our operating segments in the second half of 2008 

the types of expenses included in the selling general and administrative expenses line item are salaries wages and benefits travel sales commissions professional fees and depreciation and amortization utilities and rent for administrative facilities 

research development and engineering expenses 

research development and engineering expenses for 2009 decreased by 64 million in 2009 when compared to 2008 but remained constant as a percentage of net sales reduced spending in 2009 was driven primarily by the impact of restructuring actions and cost reduction efforts we believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies 

research development and engineering expenses increased by 62 million in 2008 when compared to 2007 but remained fairly constant as a percentage of net sales the largest driver of increased spending was for the development of new businesses 

restructuring impairment and other charges and credits 

corning recorded restructuring impairment and other charges and credits in 2009 and in 2008 which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented a description of those charges follows 

2009 restructuring actions 

in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009 we recorded charges of 228 million in 2009 primarily for a corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce the charges included costs for severance special termination benefits outplacement services and the impact of a 32 million curtailment loss for postretirement benefits in 2009 total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately 155 million with the majority of spending completed by 2010 we estimate annualized savings from these actions will be about 224 million and will be reflected largely in cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses 

2008 restructuring actions 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded 22 million of severance costs primarily for a restructuring plan in the telecommunications segment 

  

asbestos litigation 

in 2009 we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of 20 million compared to a net decrease of 340 million in 2008 the net decrease in 2008 was due primarily to a 327 million reduction to our estimated liability for asbestos litigation that was recorded in the first quarter of 2008 as a result of the increase in the likelihood of a settlement under more recently proposed terms and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under terms that had been established in 2003 for the remainder of 2008 we recorded net credit adjustments of 13 million to reflect the change in value of the estimated settlement liability 

in 2007 we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of 185 million for the change in the estimated fair value of the components of the asbestos litigation liability under terms established in 2003 

our asbestos litigation liability was estimated to be 682 million at december 31 2009 compared with an estimate of 662 million at december 31 2008 the entire obligation is classified as a noncurrent liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than 12 months after the proposed plan is ultimately effective and a portion of the obligation fulfilled through the direct contribution of corning’s investment in pce currently recorded as a noncurrent other equity method investment 

see legal proceedings for additional information about this matter 

equity in earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments 

the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments in millions 

 

 the increase in equity earnings of affiliated companies in 2009 was driven by samsung corning precision when compared to the same period last year equity earnings at samsung corning precision reflected increased volume manufacturing efficiency gains and the positive impact of 187 million from movements in foreign exchange rates offset somewhat by lower pricing when compared to 2008 

the 2008 increase in equity earnings of affiliated companies reflected strong sales and earnings performance at both samsung corning precision and dow corning when compared to 2007 

the change in equity earnings from samsung corning precision is explained more fully in the discussion of the performance of the display technologies segment and in all other 

the decline in equity earnings from dow corning in 2009 was primarily due to lower sales and restructuring charges at dow corning offset somewhat by the impact of excess foreign tax credits on foreign dividends when compared to the previous year sales at dow corning declined 7 in 2009 when compared to the prior year and included volume declines in dow corning’s traditional silicone businesses that were offset somewhat by an increase in volume at hemlock semiconductor corporation hemlock dow corning’s consolidated subsidiary that makes high purity polycrystalline for the semiconductor and solar industries sales of dow corning’s traditional silicone businesses reflected the impact of the economic downturn in 2009 sales at hemlock increased in 2009 driven by improvements in sales for solar applications when compared to 2008 movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact equity earnings from dow corning 

dow corning’s 2008 performance was driven by sales growth in its traditional silicone product lines and at hemlock dow corning sales grew 10 in 2008 with the largest growth at hemlock sales of dow corning’s traditional silicone product lines were also higher when compared to 2007 net income at dow corning and corning’s resulting equity earnings from dow corning increased 7 in 2008 when compared to 2007 reflecting the growth in net sales along with the positive impact from both a change in depreciation method and a change in the useful lives of certain fixed assets offset in part by an otherthantemporary impairment for certain securities of fannie mae and freddie mac our share of this impairment was 18 million 

  

sales at dow corning in 2010 are expected to increase greater than 10 when compared to 2009 driven by higher sales of silicone products and an increase in sales at hemlock when compared to 2009 equity earnings of dow corning are expected to improve in 2010 offset somewhat by an increase in costs for additional capacity in the first quarter of 2010 equity earnings from dow corning are expected to be down when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 driven by seasonably lower sales at hemlock 

until december 31 2007 corning had a 50 interest in samsung corning samsung electronics company ltd and affiliates owned the remaining 50 interest in samsung corning on december 31 2007 samsung corning precision acquired all of the outstanding shares of samsung corning after the transaction corning retained its 50 interest in samsung corning precision in 2007 equity earnings from samsung corning were reduced by 40 million primarily due to restructuring and impairment charges 

other income expense net 

“other income expense net” in corning’s consolidated statements of income includes the following in millions 

 

 income before income taxes 

in addition to the items identified under gross margin restructuring impairment and other charges and credits asbestos litigation credit charges and other expense income net movements in foreign exchange rates also impacted results for the years presented in 2009 income before income taxes included 414 million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2008 in 2008 income before income taxes included 35 million for the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the previous year 

provision for income taxes 

our benefit provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows in millions 

 

 the effective income tax rate for 2009 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

 

      the effective income tax benefit rate for 2008 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

 

     

  the effective income tax rate for 2007 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

 

    prior to 2007 we recorded valuation allowances against our us deferred tax assets as a result of significant losses in the us in 2007 we generated income from continuing operations in the us the tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of the valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of us income 

as more fully described in note 6 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements all of our us deferred tax assets had full valuation allowances until the second quarter of 2008 at that time we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize substantially all of our us deferred tax assets because we expect to generate sufficient levels of income in the us as a result we released 24 billion of valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2008 we considered all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence a valuation allowance was needed 

the evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets is inherently subjective following are the key items that provided positive evidence to support the release of the valuation allowance for a large portion of our deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2008 

 

    at june 30 2008 the following items were considered as negative evidence in our valuation allowance assessment but were less heavily weighted than our positive evidence 

 

   deferred tax liabilities totaled 26 million at december 31 2008 and therefore were not a significant factor in our assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets 

us profits of approximately 83 billion dollars will be required to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of december 31 2009 of that amount 36 billion of us profits will be required over the next 16 years to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with federal net operating loss carry forwards 

in 2008 and 2007 we generated income from continuing operations in the us the tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of our existing valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of us income the impact of the release of the valuation allowances and thus not recording tax expense on income generated in the us was a reduction in our effective tax rate of 86 and 81 percentage points for 2008 and 2007 respectively 

certain shorterlived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss carry forwards and state tax net operating loss carry forwards as well as other federal and state tax credits will remain with a valuation allowance recorded against them as of december 31 2009 because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire the amount of us and foreign deferred tax assets that had valuation allowances at december 31 2009 and 2008 was 245 million and 230 million respectively 

  

we do not provide income taxes on the post1992 earnings of domestic subsidiaries that we expect to recover taxfree without significant cost income taxes have been provided for post1992 unremitted earnings of domestic corporate joint ventures that we do not expect to recover taxfree unremitted earnings of domestic subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that arose in fiscal years beginning on or before december 31 1992 have been indefinitely reinvested we currently provide us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies to the extent these earnings are currently taxable or expected to be remitted as of december 31 2009 us taxes have not been provided on approximately 73 billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings that are expected to remain invested indefinitely it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings 

in 2004 we recorded valuation allowances against our entire german deferred tax assets due to losses in recent years in 2007 due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections for our overall german operations we concluded that it is more likely than not that the german national deferred tax assets are realizable and that the related valuation allowance was no longer required the impact of the releases of the valuation allowances on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 71 percentage points for 2007 

certain foreign subsidiaries in china and taiwan are operating under tax holiday arrangements the nature and extent of such arrangements vary and the benefits of such arrangements phase out through 2013 according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 73 53 and 69 percentage points for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

while we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next 12 months we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position 

see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding income tax matters 

net income attributable to corning incorporated 

as a result of the items discussed above net income and per share data was as follows in millions except per share amounts 

 

 operating segments 

effective january 1 2008 corning changed its internal reporting structure to better reflect the company’s focus on new business development and laterstage research projects and to provide more transparency on our specialty materials operating segment as a result our segment reporting includes the following changes that are in accordance with the requirements for disclosures about segments 

 

   our reportable operating segments are now as follows 

 

     

  all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “all other” this group is primarily comprised of development projects and results for new product lines 

we prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions we included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segment’s net income we have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for standalone financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us us gaap segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements 

effective january 1 2009 we began providing us income tax expense or benefit on us earnings losses due to the change in our conclusion about the realizability of our us deferred tax assets in 2008 as a result of the change in our tax position we adjusted the allocation of taxes to our operating segments in 2009 to reflect this difference the impact of changing our allocation methodology was not significant

 2009 vs 2008 

the decrease in net sales in 2009 reflected price declines of 19 and a decline in volume of 2 measured in square feet of glass sold offset somewhat by the positive impact of 228 million from movements in foreign exchange rates net sales of this segment are denominated in japanese yen and as a result are susceptible to movements in the us dollarjapanese yen exchange rate when compared to last year the volume decline in 2009 occurred largely in the first quarter of 2009 and reflected a number of industry dynamics because corning sells to panel makers and not to end market consumers supply chain expansion and contraction for this industry is a key factor in corning’s volume during the second half of 2008 the lcd market experienced a supply chain contraction that worsened as global economic conditions deteriorated and demand rapidly declined we believe the industry supply chain contraction ended in the first quarter of 2009 followed by replenishment in the second quarter over the remainder of 2009 we saw demand levels for lcd glass increase in comparison to first quarter levels in the fourth quarter of 2009 net sales increased 84 when compared to the same period last year and 6 when compared to the third quarter of 2009 with increasing demand over the course of 2009 we strategically restarted some capacity that had been temporarily idled towards the end of last year 

in the third quarter of 2009 an earthquake in shizuoka japan halted production at the company’s lcd glass manufacturing facility located there in the fourth quarter of 2009 production at the company’s lcd glass manufacturing facility in taichung taiwan was impacted by a power disruption incremental production capacity and the ability to resume some manufacturing in our affected facilities helped to ease the impact of both disruptions and support lcd glass shipments we believe our market share was negatively impacted because our capacity was lower during a period when demand remained robust the company incurred approximately 30 million of costs for accelerated depreciation charges and asset writeoffs from these events 

in 2009 equity earnings of samsung corning precision reflected the positive impact of 187 million from movements in foreign exchange rates and an increase in volume of 35 offset somewhat by price declines of 20 when compared to the same period last year equity earnings from samsung corning precision are impacted by movements in both the us dollar  japanese yen and us dollar  korean won exchange rates results of samsung corning precision reflected improvements in the overall lcd glass market which grew approximately 20 in 2009 when compared to previous year the economic recession has had a greater impact on our whollyowned business in taiwan than on samsung corning precision since taiwanese panel makers do not have strong brand recognition they are the first to experience supply chain corrections and slower to benefit from improvements in demand 

  

when compared to 2008 the decline in net income in 2009 was primarily due to the impact of volume and price declines costs associated with the earthquake in japan and restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2009 these items were offset somewhat by 342 million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates and stronger equity earnings net income of this segment in 2009 included 31 million of restructuring charges associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009 net income also includes royalty income from samsung corning precision which was higher in 2009 when compared to last year reflecting the improvements in sales volume at samsung corning precision corning licenses certain of its patents and knowhow to samsung corning precision as well as to third parties which generate royalty income refer to note 7 investments to the consolidated financial statements for more information about related party transactions

the net sales increase for the display technologies segment in 2008 resulted from a slight improvement in volume measured in square feet of glass sold along with a 294 million positive impact from movements in foreign exchange rates offset by price declines of 7 when compared to 2007 net sales of this segment are denominated in japanese yen and as a result are susceptible to movements in the us dollar  japanese yen exchange rate in the first half of 2008 glass volume of this segment increased by 37 when compared to the same period in 2007 driven by lcd television market growth and demand for lcd monitors and notebook computers in the second half of 2008 as a result of worsening global economic conditions our lcd glass volume declined by 27 when compared to the second half of 2007 the largest decline in our glass volume occurred in the fourth quarter when volume fell about 50 when compared to the prior year 

the overall lcd glass market grew approximately 15 in 2008 growth rates by region differed dramatically resulting in volume in our whollyowned business increasing only 1 while volume at samsung corning precision in korea increased 28 compared to 2007 the lower growth rate in our whollyowned business was caused in part by a decline in volume in taiwan particularly in the second half of the year and reflected a number of key market dynamics as described above taiwanese panel makers do not have as strong of brand recognition with consumers as do korean and japanese panel makers in addition a number of taiwanese panel makers were providing capacity to customers that also produce their own lcd panels and as demand has slowed purchases of this excess capacity declined fluctuating exchange rates also appear to have made korean panel makers more competitive during the industry downturn in 2008 finally we believe the taiwanese panel makers had to reduce production to align their inventory levels with lower demand 

when compared to 2007 net income for 2008 was up 10 primarily due to improvements in equity earnings from samsung corning precision and the positive impact of movement in foreign exchange rates these improvements were offset somewhat by lower volume and price declines in corning’s whollyowned business during the first half of 2008 operating performance at corning’s whollyowned business benefited from manufacturing facilities that were running at or near capacity as demand leveled off in the third quarter and then sharply declined in the fourth quarter we temporarily idled certain production assets these actions resulted in accelerated depreciation for glass tanks that were taken out of production earlier than planned by the end of 2008 more than half of the manufacturing capacity in our whollyowned business was temporarily idled 

equity earnings from samsung corning precision’s lcd business for 2008 increased by 54 when compared to 2007 due to volume gains of 28 improved manufacturing performance and the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates offset somewhat by price declines of 9 samsung corning precision experienced a similar but less severe decline in second half performance at the end of 2008 samsung corning precision had idled approximately 25 of its capacity equity earnings for 2008 were positively impacted by approximately 210 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2007 

other information 

the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan and taiwan for 2009 and 2008 three customers of the display technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for 62 and 65 respectively of total segment sales when combined our customers face the same global economic dynamics as we do in this market we believe panel makers in taiwan have been more significantly impacted by the economic downturn given their relative size when compared to korean panel makers who have a stronger presence in the end market for lcd products while we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues our nearterm sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products 

in addition samsung corning precision’s sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers in 2009 and 2008 sales to two lcd panel makers located in korea accounted for 93 and 94 respectively of samsung corning precision sales 

  

corning has invested heavily to expand capacity to meet the demand for lcd glass substrates in 2009 2008 and 2007 capital spending in this segment was 552 million 14 billion and 883 million respectively we expect capital spending for 2010 to be approximately 250 million to 350 million 

in 2005 and 2004 several of corning’s customers entered into longterm purchase and supply agreements in which corning’s display technologies segment would supply largesize glass substrates to these customers over periods of up to six years as part of the agreements these customers agreed to advance cash deposits to corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased we received our last deposit of 105 million in july 2007 and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements during 2009 2008 and 2007 we issued 253 million 266 million and 231 million respectively in credits that were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due in the event customers do not purchase the agreed upon quantities of product subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits if corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements corning may be required to return certain amounts of our customers’ deposits refer to note 11 other liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

outlook 

we expect the overall lcd glass market in 2010 measured in square feet of glass will increase by approximately 14 to 22 when compared to 2009 resulting from increased demand for lcd televisions and computer notebook sales we expect gross margin to expand in 2010 driven by increased volume cost reduction and moderate price declines we think regional market share will stabilize although regional mix shifts as described that benefit volume at samsung corning precision more than corning’s wholly owned business remain possible we will also pursue growth opportunities in china as that country’s lcd tv market continues to grow although the lcd supply chain has been impacted by the global recession we believe that the longterm drivers of this market specifically increased penetration of lcd into the total television market increased screen size and increased televisions per household remain intact 

in the first quarter of 2010 we expect volume at our whollyowned business to increase 8 to 12 and volume at samsung corning precision to be flat to up slightly when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 we expect moderate price declines in the first quarter of 2010 at both our whollyowned business and samsung corning precision when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 

the end market demand for lcd televisions monitors and notebooks is dependent on consumer retail spending among other things we are cautious about the potential negative impacts that economic conditions particularly the global economic recession and world political tensions could have on consumer demand while the industry has grown rapidly in recent years economic volatility along with consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes prices or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth therefore it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time we may incur further charges in this segment to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity in addition changes in foreign exchange rates principally the japanese yen will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment 

telecommunications 

dollars in millions 

 

 2009 vs 2008 

in 2009 net sales of this segment decreased when compared to the same period last year and reflected declines across all of our businesses when compared to the previous year lower volumes in both north america and europe were offset somewhat by higher net sales for optical fiber and cable in china as the country continues to expand its telecommunications infrastructure volume in north america and europe reflected the continuing impact of the economic recession in addition net sales of this segment were negatively impacted by 23 million from movements in foreign exchange rates 

  

for 2009 the decline in net income reflected the volume impacts as described above and the impact of restructuring charges offset somewhat by lower operating expenses resulting from restructuring actions when compared to 2008 net income of this segment included the impact of 42 million of restructuring charges in 2009 associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan actions in this segment included workforce reductions the consolidation of manufacturing operations that resulted in the closure of two plants and the exit of some minor businesses movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of net income for the periods presented 

the telecommunications segment has a concentrated customer base in 2009 one customer of the telecommunications segment accounted for 12 of total segment net sales in 2008 and 2007 two customers of the telecommunications segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of total segment net sales collectively accounted for 24 and 25 respectively of total segment sales when combined 

2008 vs 2007 

net sales for the segment were up slightly over 2007 primarily due to volume gains in fibertothepremises products and the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates increased sales in fibertothepremises products reflected strong demand in europe and north america the increase was partially offset by moderating price declines reduced demand for copper based products in europe and the absence of sales from corning’s european submarine cabling business that was sold in april 2007 

net income in 2008 included 17 million for the cost of a restructuring plan that was implemented in the fourth quarter the decline in net income in 2008 reflected the impact of the restructuring charge price declines higher operating expenses and the absence of a 19 million gain on the sale of the european submarine cabling business when compared to 2007 in 2008 movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the net income of this segment 

outlook 

we expect net sales of the telecommunications segment to be down in 2010 driven by a decline in demand for private and public network products lower spending for telecommunications infrastructure in china in 2010 and lower sales due to the exit of certain businesses in 2009 

changes in our customers’ expected deployment plans or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fibertothepremises products could also affect sales levels should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated our sales and earnings would be adversely affected in the first quarter of 2010 we expect net sales of this segment to be down 10 to 15 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 due to lower demand for private network products and fiber demand in china 

environmental technologies 

dollars in millions 

 

 2009 vs 2008 

when compared to 2008 net sales for 2009 were negatively impacted by lower automotive production caused by the global recession and subsequent inventory reductions at automotive manufacturers and dealers in the first quarter of 2009 us automotive builds were at their lowest levels since corning entered this business in the first half of 2009 net sales of this segment declined 40 when compared to the first half of 2008 in the second half of 2009 yearoveryear net sales were up 14 when compared to the same period last year due to government incentives in china europe and the us in addition we believe inventories at automotive manufacturers and dealers returned to more normalized levels in the fourth quarter of 2009 which also caused increased demand diesel product sales in 2009 reflected the impact of the recessiondriven weak freight industry in the us this was offset somewhat by improved demand in the second half of 2009 as engine manufacturers prepared for next year’s stricter heavy duty diesel emission standards net sales in 2009 were negatively impacted by 9 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the same period last year 

  

net loss in 2009 reflected lower sales and manufacturing volume of both automotive and diesel products offset somewhat by lower operating expenses when compared to net income 2008 in addition net loss of this segment in 2009 included the impact of restructuring charges restructuring charges for this segment totaled 28 million for the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to lower sales in 2009 movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the results of this operating segment 

the environmental technologies reportable operating segment sells to a concentrated customer base of catalyzer and emission control systems manufacturers who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers the use of our substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel engine manufacturers our customers and their customers are experiencing the negative impact of the automotive and freight industry downturns for 2009 three customers of the environmental technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment sales accounted for 85 of total segment sales for 2008 and 2007 net sales to those same three customers accounted for 81 of total segment sales while we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues with our direct customers our nearterm sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products 

2008 vs 2007 

sales of the environmental technologies segment in 2008 were down 6 when compared to the previous year and reflected lower sales of automotive and diesel products offset somewhat by favorable foreign exchange rate movements sales of automotive products reflected the significant decline in demand in the european and us automotive industry in the second half of 2008 in line with worsening economic conditions diesel product sales increased due to the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates offset somewhat by volume declines diesel product sales reflect the continued decline in the us freight industry that began in late 2007 net sales of this segment in 2008 were positively impacted by 24 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the prior year 

net income of this segment was down when compared to last year due primarily to reduced sales volumes and manufacturing inefficiencies in both businesses net income was positively impacted by 3 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the prior year 

outlook 

we expect net sales of this segment to improve in 2010 driven by moderate growth in demand for automotive products we expect to see continued strength in demand due to replenishment of dealer and supply chain inventories through the first quarter of 2010 diesel product sales are expected to improve slightly driven by regulation tightening but will not reflect any significant growth until the freight industry recovers and excess fleet inventory is fully utilized when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 net sales of this segment in the first quarter of 2010 are expected to start strongly but decline 10 in the full quarter as the rebuild of auto inventories nears completion 

specialty materials 

dollars in millions 

 

  

 2009 vs 2008 

the specialty materials segment manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs consequently this segment operates in a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets that include consumer electronics display optics and components semiconductor optics and components aerospace and defense astronomy ophthalmic products and telecommunications components 

  

net sales decreased in 2009 due primarily to lower sales of semiconductor optics and components as a result of the significant market downturn when compared to the prior year this decrease was offset somewhat by an increase in sales of gorilla ® glass a protective cover glass that is optimized for portable display devices sales of gorilla ® glass have continued to increase as the company moves to capitalize on market opportunities for this product the net loss for 2009 resulted from the decline in net sales along with manufacturing development costs for gorilla ® glass when compared to 2008 the net loss in 2009 also included 17 million of restructuring charges for the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009 and costs associated with closing one of this segment’s manufacturing facilities in 2009 movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the profitability of this segment 

in the specialty materials segment there were no individual customers that accounted for 10 or more of this segment’s net sales for 2009 

2008 vs 2007 

when compared to the previous year net sales were down 2 in 2008 due to a decline in sales of semiconductor materials products that were negatively impacted by the global recession offset somewhat by increased sales of gorilla ® glass and the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates the increase in net loss for this segment was due to the decline in sales along with higher operating expenses for gorilla ® glass 

for 2008 one customer of the specialty materials segment accounted for 11 of total segment sales 

outlook 

for 2010 we expect sales of this segment to increase driven by increased sales of gorilla ® glass when compared to 2009 we expect a modest increase in sales of semiconductor products as the semiconductor industry begins to improve in the first quarter of 2010 we expect net sales to be down 10 to 15 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 

life sciences 

dollars in millions 

 

 2009 vs 2008 

for 2009 the increase in net sales of this segment reflected sales from the acquisition of axygen which was completed in the third quarter of 2009 offset somewhat by volume declines in the company’s existing life sciences products sales of axygen products were approximately 36 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 for 2009 the decline in net income resulted primarily from acquisitionrelated costs and the impact of 8 million of restructuring charges associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan when compared to the 2008 movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales or net income of this operating segment in 2009 

for 2009 two customers in the life sciences segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of total segment net sales collectively accounted for 45 of total segment sales for 2008 and 2007 one customer accounted for 45 and 44 respectively of total segment sales 

2008 vs 2007 

net sales of the life sciences segment for 2008 were up when compared to 2007 driven by sales growth of scientific laboratory products in all of this segment’s global markets price increases and 8 million from the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates government and private spending for drug development discovery and production fueled market growth in this segment the improvement in net income in 2008 reflected the sales increases as described offset somewhat by higher operating expenses 

outlook 

sales of the life sciences segment for 2010 are expected to be up primarily due to the acquisition of axygen when compared to 2009 in the first quarter of 2010 we expect net sales to be even with or up 5 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 

  

all other

 2009 vs 2008 

all other includes all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting this group is primarily comprised of development projects such as advanced flow reactors and synthetic green lasers and results for new product lines such as the epic ™ system this segment also includes results for certain corporate investments such as samsung corning precision’s nonlcd glass businesses and the results of corsam technologies llc corsam an equity affiliate established between corning and samsung corning precision to provide glass technology research refer to note 7 investments for additional information about samsung corning precision and related party transactions 

the decrease in this segment’s net loss for 2009 resulted primarily from lower operating expenses as a result of restructuring actions in the first quarter of 2009 cost reduction efforts and the impact of the change in the company’s tax position net loss of this segment for 2009 included 4 million of restructuring charges associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan 

2008 vs 2007 

in 2008 the increase in net loss reflected higher spending for new development projects and a 14 million loss on the sale of corning’s steuben glass business offset somewhat by the absence of restructuring and impairment charges in 2007 equity earnings of all other included 40 million for our share of restructuring and impairment charges for samsung corning precision’s nonlcd businesses 

liquidity and capital resources 

financing and capital structure 

the following items impacted corning’s financing and capital structure during 2009 and 2008 

 

    we have access to a 11 billion committed unsecured multicurrency credit facility this credit facility expires in november 2011 the facility includes two financial covenants a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio at december 31 2009 we were in compliance with both financial covenants 

  

capital spending 

capital spending totaled 890 million 19 billion and 13 billion in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively capital spending in 2009 was driven primarily by projects in our display technologies segment that were started in 2008 capital spending in 2008 and 2007 primarily included expansion of lcd glass capacity in the display technologies segment and new capacity for diesel products in the environmental technologies segment our 2010 capital spending program is expected to be approximately 600 million to 700 million but there could also be up to 300 million of additional spending for adjacent opportunities possible capacity in china and precious metals to support growing capacity approximately 250 million to 350 million will be directed toward our display technologies segment 

cash flows 

summary of cash flow data 

 

 2009 vs 2008 

although 2009 net income decreased significantly from 2008 operating cash flow declined only slightly the decrease in net income resulted primarily from two nonrecurring noncash items the release of 25 billion of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and a 340 million reduction in asbestos related liabilities when compared to 2008 operating cash flow in 2009 reflected higher pension contributions and restructuring payments offset somewhat by an increase in cash from changes in working capital and higher dividends from equity affiliates 

net cash used in investing activities was lower in 2009 when compared to 2008 due to lower capital expenditures in our display technologies segment offset partially by the acquisition of axygen 

net cash used in financing activities also decreased in 2009 when compared to the prior year due to the issuance of longterm debt and the discontinuation of common stock repurchases 

2008 vs 2007 

as the significant increase in 2008 net income was largely driven by two noncash items 2008 operating cash increased only slightly when compared to 2007 the two noncash items were the release of 25 billion of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and a 340 million reduction in asbestos related liabilities 

in addition cash from operating activities benefited from slower growth in working capital higher dividends from equity affiliates and lower contributions for retirementrelated benefits compared to 2007 these benefits were partially offset by an increase in taxes paid and customer deposit credits issued 

net cash used in investing activities in 2008 increased when compared to the previous year due to a 659 million increase in capital spending largely attributable to higher spending in the display technologies segment and a smaller reduction in shortterm investments compared to 2007 

net cash used in financing activities was higher when compared to the previous year due to an increase in repurchases of common stock and an increase in dividends paid corning began paying a quarterly dividend of 005 per share in the third quarter of 2007 

defined benefit pension plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees our largest single pension plan is corning’s us qualified plan at december 31 2009 this plan accounted for 81 of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation and 90 of the related plans’ assets 

we have traditionally contributed to the us qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the irs minimum requirements and as a result mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until some time after 2010 in 2009 we made voluntary cash contributions of 75 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and 5 million to our international pension plans in 2008 we made voluntary cash contributions of 50 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and 2 million to our international pension plans 

  

in 2008 we experienced significant negative returns on our pension assets for our primary defined benefit plan as a result of deteriorating financial market conditions which increased pension expense for 2009 by 33 million in 2009 actual investment experience on the pension assets of our primary defined benefit plan was favorable 

although we will not be subject to any mandatory contributions in 2010 we anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of up to 230 million to our domestic and international pension plans in 2010 

refer to note 13 employee retirement plans to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

customer deposits 

certain customers of our display technologies segment have entered into longterm supply agreements and have agreed to make advance cash deposits to secure supply of largesize glass substrates the deposits will be reduced through future product purchases thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods 

between 2004 and 2007 we received a total of 937 million for customer deposit agreements we received our last deposit of 105 million in 2007 and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements 

in 2009 2008 and 2007 we issued credit memoranda which totaled 253 million 266 million and 231 million respectively these credit amounts were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due customer deposit liabilities were 104 million and 369 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively in 2010 we expect to issue approximately 80 million in credit memoranda 

restructuring 

in 2009 we recorded charges of 228 million associated with a corporatewide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009 the charge included costs for severance special termination benefits outplacement services asset writeoffs and the impact of a curtailment loss for postretirement benefits total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately 155 million primarily related to termination benefits 

during 2009 2008 and 2007 we made payments of 89 million 17 million and 39 million respectively related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions refer to note 2 restructuring impairment and other charges credits to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

credit ratings 

as of february 10 2010 our credit ratings were as follows 

 

 management assessment of liquidity 

we ended the fourth quarter of 2009 with 36 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments the company has adequate sources of liquidity and we are confident in our ability to generate cash to meet existing or reasonably likely future cash requirements our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted at december 31 2009 about half of the consolidated amount was held outside of the us almost all of the amounts held outside of the us are available for repatriation subject to relevant tax consequences we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed we expect accumulated nonus cash balances will remain outside of the us and that we will meet us liquidity needs through future cash flows use of us cash balances external borrowings or some combination of these sources 

in 2009 realized gains and losses on availableforsale securities were not significant in 2008 we recorded 53 million of net realized losses on shortterm investments which represented less than 6 of our total holdings of availableforsale securities at that time refer to note 3 availableforsale investments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in july 2007 corning’s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to 500 million to be completed by the end of 2008 in july 2008 corning announced that its board of directors and executive committee had approved a second stock repurchase program of up to an additional 1 billion to be completed by the end of 2009 through december 31 2008 we had repurchased approximately 40 million shares of common stock for 875 million under these programs there were no repurchases in 2009 

we complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial statements at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk we closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues we currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues 

our major source of funding for 2010 and beyond will be our operating cash flow and our existing balances of cash cash equivalents and short term investments we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations the asbestos litigation research and development capital expenditures scheduled debt repayments and dividend payments corning also has access to a 11 billion unsecured committed credit through november 2011 if market conditions are favorable the company may seek to enter into negotiations with its bank group prior to the expiration date to renew and extend the credit arrangements the existing credit agreement includes two financial covenants a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio at december 31 2009 we were in compliance with both financial covenants 

the required leverage ratio which measures debt to total capital is a maximum of 50 at december 31 2009 and 2008 our leverage using this measure was 11 the required interest coverage ratio which is an adjusted earnings measure as defined by our facility compared to interest expense is a ratio of at least 35 times at december 31 2009 and 2008 our interest coverage ratio using this measure was 303 times and 435 times respectively 

our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events in addition the majority of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision whereby a default on one debt obligation of the company in excess of a specified amount also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument as of december 31 2009 we were in compliance with all such provisions 

  

management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands commitments events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in our liquidity in addition other than items discussed there are no known material trends favorable or unfavorable in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources 

off balance sheet arrangements 

off balance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 

corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include the following 

 

  at the time a guarantee is issued the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant 

refer to note 14 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

corning leases certain transportation equipment from three trusts that qualify as variable interest entities the sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to corning 

for variable interest entities we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of its expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests which are the ownership contractual or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests 

corning has identified three entities that qualify as variable interest entities none of these entities is considered to be significant to corning’s consolidated statements of position 

corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit liquidity or market risk support to that entity 

contractual obligations 

the amounts of our obligations follow in millions 

 

  

    

    we are required at the time a guarantee is issued to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant 

we have agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow corning the funding of the dow corning credit facility will be required only if dow corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed bankruptcy plan the purchase obligations primarily represent raw material and energyrelated takeorpay contracts we believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 

environment 

corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 21 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by the agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2009 and 2008 corning had accrued approximately 26 million undiscounted and 21 million undiscounted respectively for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates that required us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments follow 

impairment of assets held for use 

we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified we review our longlived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 

manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals primarily platinum and rhodium these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of longlived assets this review considers all of the company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process in reclamation fabrication or refinement in anticipation of reuse or awaiting use to support increased capacity precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other purposes 

examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include 

 

        

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for the majority of our reporting segments we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

for longlived assets when impairment indicators are present we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used assessments also consider changes in asset utilization including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 

the fair value of longlived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of longlived assets and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals some of the more significant estimates and assumptions in our analysis include market size and growth market share projected selling prices manufacturing cost and discount rate our estimates are based upon our historical experience our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

as of december 31 2009 and 2008 we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our longlived assets were not recoverable at december 31 2009 the fair market value of precious metals was higher than our carrying value by 193 million at december 31 2008 the fair market value of precious metals was lower than our carrying value by 598 million currently these precious metal assets primarily in the display technologies segment are recoverable as part of their asset groupings there is the potential for impairment in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of our segments such events include but are not limited to a significant decrease in demand for products of our display technologies segment or a significant decrease in its profitability 

impairment of goodwill 

we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments on a number of matters including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units 

our annual goodwill recoverability assessment is completed in the fourth quarter as it is traditionally based on our annual strategic planning process this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the longterm growth of our businesses and forecasting future cash flows our valuation method is an “income approach” using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return our estimates are based upon our historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends as disclosed in note 10 goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements corning’s goodwill relates primarily to the telecommunications specialty materials and life sciences operating segments 

telecommunications 

goodwill for the telecommunication segment is tested at the operating segment level we have aggregated the telecommunications operating segment businesses into a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing based on the manner in which we operate our businesses the vertically integrated nature of these operations shared assets operating and finance resources and management the nature of production processes and the regulatory environment and the shared support and benefit from common research and development activity 

  

results for the telecommunications segment in 2009 were down when compared with 2008 we expect the worldwide telecommunications industry market to be negatively impacted by the global recession with lower sales in 2010 than in 2009 the results of our impairment tests in 2009 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount a discount rate of 9 was used in 2009 and 10 was used in 2008 we determined a range of discount rates between 7 and 11 would not have affected our conclusion 

specialty materials 

goodwill for the specialty materials segment is tested at the component level which is one level below an operating segment because the goodwill is the result of transactions associated with certain businesses in this operating segment although the specialty materials segment had small reported losses in 2009 and 2008 we expect in the near term new products will partially offset some of the declines resulting from recent economic conditions and we anticipate growth in new products will also improve longerterm profitability the results of our impairment test in 2009 and 2008 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its book value a discount rate of 9 was used in 2009 and 10 was used in 2008 we determined a range of discount rates between 7 and 11 would not have affected our conclusion 

life sciences 

in 2009 the life sciences segment recorded goodwill in connection with the acquisition of axygen goodwill for the life sciences segment is tested at the operating segment level we have aggregated the life sciences operating segment businesses into a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing based on the manner in which we operate our businesses 

results in the life sciences segment in 2009 reflected the impact of acquisitionrelated costs and 8 million of restructuring charges associated with the company’s corporatewide restructuring plan when compared to 2008 the results of our impairment tests in 2009 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount a discount rate of 8 was used in 2009 we determined a range of discount rates between 6 and 10 would not have affected our conclusion 

restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions 

we are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including for example employee termination costs restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses of portions thereof their profitability cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome the judgment involved can be difficult subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses 

restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which as a result require impairment we are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned 

income taxes 

we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environments in which we do business it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances 

in the second quarter of 2008 we released 24 billion of valuation allowances because we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient levels of profitability in the us to realize substantially all of our us deferred tax assets a key trend included in our projections was the rate of penetration of lcd televisions driven by an increase in televisions per household faster lcd television replacement rates the continued decline of cathode ray tube products and growth in emerging markets such as china another key trend included global demand improvements for diesel products based on the timing of new government regulations and economic growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 we released an additional 70 million and 45 million respectively of valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets as a result of a change in our estimate of us taxable income 

significant estimates and assumptions used in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets included the longterm stabilization of us income from forecasted royalty income in our display technologies operating segment the longterm growth of our diesel business and the future success of new products 

  

in determining our provision for income taxes we use an annual effective income tax rate based on full year income permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates significant judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide income tax position as well as the effective tax rate 

equity method investments 

at december 31 2009 and 2008 the carrying value of our equity method investments was 40 billion and 31 billion respectively with our two largest equity method investments comprising approximately 94 of the balance we review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if an event or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be otherthantemporarily impaired when such indicators are present we then perform an indepth review for impairment an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability forecasted tax rates foreign currency exchange rate movements terminal value assumptions historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends 

as of december 31 2009 and 2008 we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable 

fair value measures 

as required corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the company’s own market assumptions once inputs have been characterized we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement in addition observable market data must be used when available corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are shortterm and longterm investments and derivatives these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions 

derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in arriving at the fair value of corning’s derivative assets and liabilities we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction amounts related to credit risk are not material 

probability of litigation outcomes 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter case law and other casespecific issues see part ii  item 1 legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face the most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability including the inherent complexity of a chapter 11 filing our history of success in defending asbestos claims our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses and our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants’ representatives the proposed asbestos resolution amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies the approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is not certain and faces objections by some parties any approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is subject to appeal the proposed amended pcc plan is also subject to a vote of pcc’s creditors for these and other reasons corning’s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters the estimate of the cost of resolving the nonpcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning’s financial statements is remote 

other possible liabilities 

we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters including certain tax planning and environmental matters these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 

  

variable interest entities 

the company has interests in certain unconsolidated entities these investments are evaluated periodically to determine if they qualify as variable interest entities and whether corning is a primary beneficiary for any of those qualifying interests a variable interest entity vie is an entity that lacks sufficient equity investment or in which the equity investors do not have certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest a company that absorbs a majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the expected returns of a vie is considered to be a primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie the determination of whether an entity is a vie and if a company is the primary beneficiary of a vie are complex areas that require judgments about items such as the sufficiency of the equity at risk the evaluation of contractual arrangements and assessments about forecasted information while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate changes in these judgments or estimates could affect corning’s results 

pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb 

pension and opeb costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates benefits earned interest cost expected return on plan assets mortality rates and other factors in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 

as of december 31 2009 the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was 2465 million 

the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans 

 

 the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning’s funding requirements 

in addition at december 31 2009 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders’ equity by 87 million before tax and a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders’ equity by 85 million in addition the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to corning’s us opeb plans 

 

 the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned in certain instances revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns allowances discounts and other factors these estimates are supported by historical data while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning’s future results 

  

stock compensation 

stockbased compensation expense and disclosures are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts these assumptions include riskfree discount rates expected term of the stock based compensation instrument granted volatility of stock and option prices expected time between grant date and date of exercise attrition performance and other factors these assumptions require us to exercise judgment our estimates of these assumptions typically are based upon our historical experience currently available market place data and forward looking explanatory variables while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s future stock based compensation expense and disclosures

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects 

 

  we have foreign currency exposure to the japanese yen euro new taiwan dollar and korean won we selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 18 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases these hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or corning enter into lending situations generally on an intercompany basis denominated in currencies other than their local currency we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes corning uses derivative instruments forwards to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and as such are referred to as undesignated hedges changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities are recorded in current period earnings in other expense income net in the consolidated statements of income 

equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations equity in earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments were 14 billion in 2009 and 2008 with foreignbased affiliates comprising over 78 of this amount in 2009 equity earnings from samsung corning precision totaled 11 billion for 2009 and 927 million for 2008 exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies 

we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2009 we had open forward contracts and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements all of which were designated as hedges at december 31 2009 a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 278 million compared to 215 million at december 31 2008 specific to the japanese yen a 10 adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 131 million compared to 118 million at december 31 2008 specific to the euro a 10 adverse movement in quoted euro exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 107 million compared to 68 million at december 31 2008 

as we derive approximately 76 of our net sales from outside the us our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies most notably the japanese yen and euro our forecasts generally assume exchange rates during 2010 remain constant at january 2010 levels a plus or minus 10 point movement in the us dollar  japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2010 net sales of approximately 246 million and net income of approximately 340 million a plus or minus 10 point movement in the us dollar  euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2010 net sales of approximately 34 million and net income of approximately 8 million 

interest rate risk management 

it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2009 our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than 1 of variable rate instruments

our principal executive and principal financial officers after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the securities exchange act of 1934 exchange act rules 13a15e or 15d15e as of the end of the period covered by this report have concluded that based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph b of exchange act rules 13a15 or 15d15 that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

internal control over financial reporting 

 

 management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures and adequate internal control over financial reporting for corning management is also responsible for the assessment of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 

disclosure controls and procedures mean controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms corning’s disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by corning in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to corning’s management including corning’s principal executive and principal financial officers or other persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

corning’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america corning’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of corning’s assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and that corning’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of corning’s management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of corning’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that corning’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2009 the effectiveness of corning’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein

 item 1 business 

general 

corning traces its origins to a glass business established in 1851 the present corporation was incorporated in the state of new york in december 1936 the company’s name was changed from corning glass works to corning incorporated on april 28 1989 

corning is a global technologybased corporation that operates in five reportable business segments display technologies telecommunications environmental technologies specialty materials and life sciences corning manufactures and processes products at more than 51 plants in 15 countries

raw materials 

corning’s production of specialty glasses ceramics and related materials requires significant quantities of energy uninterrupted power sources certain precious metals and various batch materials 

although energy shortages and power interruptions have not been a problem recently the cost of energy has been volatile corning has achieved flexibility through important engineering changes to take advantage of lowcost energy sources in most significant processes specifically many of corning’s principal manufacturing processes can be operated with natural gas propane oil or electricity or a combination of these energy sources 

availability of resources ores minerals polymers and processed chemicals required in manufacturing operations appears to be adequate corning’s suppliers from time to time may experience capacity limitations in their own operations or may eliminate certain product lines corning believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch materials and precious metals for many products corning has alternate glass compositions that would allow operations to continue without interruption in the event of specific materials shortages 

certain key materials and proprietary equipment used in the manufacturing of products are currently sole sourced or available only from a limited number of suppliers any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in lost sales due to delays or reductions in product shipments or reductions in corning’s gross margins

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report or otherwise have a detrimental affect on the company these risks should be considered in making any investment decisions in corning future results could be materially affected by general industry and market conditions changes in laws or accounting rules general economic and political conditions including a global economic slowdown fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates terrorism political unrest or international conflicts political instability or major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this annual report additional risks not described above or unknown to us may also adversely affect corning or its results 

as a result of the current recession in the economies of the united states and many other countries and volatility and uncertainty in global capital and credit markets a number of the risks we normally face may increase in both our consolidated operations and at our equity method investments these include 

 

       our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or circumstances of one or more key customers leading to the substantial reduction in orders for our products 

corning’s ten largest customers account for about 54 of our sales there are two individual customers which accounted for more than 10 of corning’s consolidated sales in 2008 au optronics corporation auo and chi mei optoelectronics corporation chi mei two customers of the display technologies segment accounted for 11 and 10 respectively of consolidated sales in 2008 

in addition a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in each of our reportable operating segments for 2008 three customers of the display technologies segment accounted for 65 of total segment net sales when combined in the telecommunications segment two customers accounted for 24 of segment net sales when combined in the environmental technologies segment three customers accounted for 81 of total segment sales in aggregate in the specialty materials segment one customer accounted for 11 of segment sales in 2008 in the life sciences segment one distributor accounted for 45 of segment sales in 2008 

samsung corning precision’s sales were also concentrated in 2008 with sales to two lcd panel makers located in south korea accounting for approximately 94 of total samsung corning precision sales 

  

the sale of lcd glass substrates in 2008 and previous years provide no assurance that positive trends will continue our customers are lcd panel and color filter makers as they switch to larger size glass the pace of their orders may be uneven while they adjust their manufacturing processes and facilities additionally consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes price or other seasonal factors may lead to pauses in market growth from time to time our customers may not be able to maintain their profitability or access sufficient capital to fund routine maintenance and operations or planned expansions which may limit their pace of orders to us emerging material technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications resulting in a decline in demand for our lcd products technologies for displays in competition with lcd panels may reduce or eliminate the need for our glass substrate these technologies may include organic light emitting diodes and plasma display panels new process technologies developed by our competitors may also place us at a cost or quality disadvantage our inability to manufacture glass substrates in the sizes and quantities needed by our customers may result in loss of revenue margins and profits or liabilities for failure to supply a scarcity of resources limitations on technology personnel or other factors resulting in a failure to produce commercial quantities of very large size glass substrates particularly from new facilities being constructed at a major customer in japan could have adverse financial consequences to us 

our telecommunications segment customers’ purchases of our products are affected by their capital expansion plans general market and economic uncertainty and regulatory changes including broadband policy sales in the telecommunications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of fibertothepremises deployments by our customers such as verizon communications inc our sales will be dependent on planned targets for homes passed and connected changes in our customers’ deployment plans could adversely affect future sales in any quarter or for the full year 

in the environmental technologies segment sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for automotive and diesel emissions and pollution control are expected to fluctuate with vehicle production changes in governmental laws and regulations for air quality and emission controls may also influence future sales sales in our environmental technologies segment are mainly to three catalyzers and emission system component manufacturers our customers sell these systems to automotive original equipment manufacturers and diesel engine manufacturers sales within this segment may be affected by adverse developments in the global vehicle or us freight hauling industries or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicle sales or downturns in freight traffic 

sales in our specialty materials segment track closely with the semiconductor cycle and our customers’ responses to that cycle in 2008 one customer accounted for 11 of specialty materials segment sales 

sales in our life sciences segment are through two large distributors and the remaining balance is to a variety of government entities pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies hospitals universities and other research facilities in 2008 our primary distributor accounted for 45 of life sciences’ segment sales changes in our distribution arrangements in this segment may adversely affect this segment’s financial results 

if the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate demand for our products may decline which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial performance 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies evolving industry or government standards and new product introductions our success is expected to depend in substantial part on the successful introduction of new products or upgrades of current products and our ability to compete with new technologies the following factors related to our products and markets if not achieved could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

 

       we face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely affect our financial performance 

we face pricing pressure in each of our leading businesses as a result of intense competition emerging new technologies or overcapacity while we will work toward reducing our costs to offset pricing pressures we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or to sustain our current rate of cost reduction we anticipate pricing pressures will continue into 2009 and beyond in all our businesses 

  

we face risks related to our international operations and sales 

we have customers and significant operations including manufacturing and sales located outside the us we have large manufacturing operations for liquid crystal display glass substrates in taiwan japan and korea including an equity investment in samsung corning precision operating in south korea that makes glass substrates for the korean lcd market all of our display segment customers are located in the asiapacific region as a result of these and other international operations we face a number of risks including 

 

          any of these items could cause our sales or profitability to be significantly reduced 

additionally a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our display technologies segment is concentrated in three overseas countries and it is reasonably possible that the use of one or more such facilities could be disrupted due to the specialized nature of the assets and the customers’ locations it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from facilities in other countries accordingly loss of these facilities could produce a nearterm severe impact to our display business and the company as a whole 

we face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations 

because we have significant customers and operations outside the us fluctuations in foreign currencies especially the japanese yen the new taiwan dollar the korean won and the euro affect our sales and profit levels foreign exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the dollar and japanese yen sales in our display technologies segment representing 46 of corning’s sales in 2008 are denominated in japanese yen if sales grow in our display technologies segment this will increase our exposure to currency fluctuations corning hedges significant transaction and balance sheet currency exposures and uses derivatives instruments to limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities as well as operating results although we hedge these items changes in exchange rates especially the japanese yen to us dollar may significantly impact our reported revenues and profits 

if the financial condition of our customers declines our credit risks could increase 

although we have a rigorous process to administer credit and believe our reserve is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable if our customers fail to meet their payment obligations to us we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amounts reserved some customers of our display technologies segment are thinly capitalized andor marginally profitable in our environmental products segment the us auto makers and certain of their suppliers have encountered credit downgrades these factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business as of december 31 2008 reserves and allowances for trade receivables totaled approximately 20 million 

if we do not successfully adjust our manufacturing volumes and fixed cost structure or achieve manufacturing yields or sufficient product reliability our operating results and cash flow could suffer and we may not achieve anticipated profitability levels 

investments in additional manufacturing capacity of certain businesses including liquid crystal display glass and diesel emission substrates and filters present challenges we may face technical and process issues in moving to commercial production and there can be no assurance that corning will be able to pace its capacity expansion to the actual demand economic results may adversely affect our ability to complete planned capacity expansion and products it is possible that manufacturing capacity may exceed or lag customer demand during certain periods 

  

the manufacturing of our products involves highly complex and precise processes requiring production in highly controlled and dustfree environments changes in our manufacturing processes could significantly reduce our manufacturing yields and product reliability in some cases existing manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the requirements of our customers we will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to achieve targeted volume pricing and cost levels that will permit profitable operations while we continue to fund projects to improve our manufacturing techniques and processes we may not achieve satisfactory cost levels in our manufacturing activities that will fully satisfy our profitability targets 

our future financial performance depends on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials parts and manufacturing equipment components to meet the demands of our customers 

our ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials parts and components from our suppliers we may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages there can be no assurances that we will not encounter these problems in the future furthermore certain manufacturing equipment raw materials or components are available only from a single source or limited sources we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner a reduction interruption or delay of supply or a significant increase in the price for supplies such as manufacturing equipment raw materials or energy could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

we have incurred and may in the future incur restructuring and other charges the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately 

we have recorded several charges for restructuring impairment of assets and the writeoff of cost and equity based investments in the last 3 years as a result of the decline in the economy and its impact on corning’s businesses we recorded a restructuring charge of 22 million in the telecommunications segment in 2008 and in january announced our plans to reduce our global workforce which will cause a restructuring charge in the range of 115 million to 165 million in the first quarter of 2009 certain of our equity affiliates are also considering restructuring charges we may have additional actions which result in restructuring charges in the future 

we have incurred and may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 

at december 31 2008 corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of 305 million while we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur especially if the current economic recession continues for a lengthy period or becomes more severe 

if our products including materials purchased from our suppliers experience performance issues our business will suffer 

our business depends on the production of products of consistently high quality our products components and materials purchased from our suppliers are typically tested for quality these testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios for various reasons our products including materials purchased from our suppliers may fail to perform as expected in some cases product redesigns or additional expense may be required to correct a defect a significant or systemic product failure could result in customer relations problems lost sales and financial damages 

we face competition in most of our businesses 

we expect that we will face additional competition from existing competitors low cost manufacturers and new entrants we must invest in research and development expand our engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities and continue to improve customer service and support in order to remain competitive we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position 

changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors some of which are outside of our control including 

 

        

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals 

accounting and disclosure rules may affect financial results 

generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations for many areas of our business such as revenue recognition accounting for investments and accounting for stock options are very complex and involve significant and sometimes subjective judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantly impact our reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures in the future without a corresponding change in our cash flows 

we rely on key personnel and the loss of their services or the inability to attract and retain them may negatively affect our businesses 

our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified research and development engineering and operating personnel generally and during periods of rapid growth especially in those of our businesses focused on new products and advanced manufacturing processes is essential to our business success we also depend on the services of experienced key senior management 

the loss of the services of any of our key research and development engineering or operational personnel or senior management without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance 

we are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations 

our manufacturing process generates chemical waste waste water and other industrial waste and various green house gases at various stages in the manufacturing process and we are currently or may be in the future subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of such substances we have installed various types of antipollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our various facilities we have taken steps to affect the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations however we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that the local or national governments will not take steps toward adopting more stringent environment standards 

any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us suspensioncessation of production or operations in addition environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the us and other countries such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and co 2 abatement may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by among other things substantially increasing manufacturing costs limiting availability of scarce resources especially energy or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers 

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses we cannot assure you that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors changes in law concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to protect our intellectual property litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently uncertain and the outcome is often unpredictable other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios 

the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products we are and may in the future be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation that may result in loss of revenue require us to incur substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us we cannot assure you as to the outcome of any such claims 

  

current or future litigation may harm our financial condition or results of operations 

pending threatened or future litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes expenses and costs exceeding amounts estimated or insured in particular we have been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos and adverse rulings in such lawsuits or the inability to successfully resolve such matters may adversely affect the company as described in legal proceedings a new pcc plan of reorganization was filed with the bankruptcy court on january 29 2009 proposing a resolution of pcc asbestos claims it remains reasonably possible that changes to the amended pcc plan may be negotiated and the elements of the plan and its approval are subject to a number of contingencies before the resolution outlined in the plan becomes final 

we face risks through our equity method investments in companies that we do not control 

corning’s net income includes significant equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended december 31 2008 we recognized 13 billion of equity earnings of which 96 came from our two largest investments dow corning corporation which makes silicone products and samsung corning precision which makes liquid crystal display glass samsung corning precision is located in the asiapacific region and is subject to political and geographic risks mentioned above as well as business and other risks within the display segment our equity investments may not continue to perform at the same levels as in recent years in 2007 we recognized equity losses associated with samsung corning co ltd a 50 equity method investment that made glass panels and funnels for conventional televisions which recorded fixed asset and other impairment charges dow corning emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2004 and has certain obligations under its plan of reorganization to resolve and fund claims of its creditors and personal injury claimants dow corning may incur further bankruptcy charges in the future which may adversely affect its operations or assets 

we may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us 

we face the risk of loss resulting from product liability securities fiduciary liability intellectual property antitrust contractual warranty environmental fraud and other lawsuits whether or not such claims are valid in addition our product liability fiduciary directors and officers property natural catastrophe and comprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect our insurance costs can be volatile and at any time can increase given changes in market supply and demand we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs a successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us to pay substantial sums some of the carriers in our excess insurance programs are in liquidation and may not be able to respond if we should have claims reaching into excess layers the financial health of other insurers may deteriorate several of our insurance carriers are litigating with us the extent if any of their obligation to provide insurance coverage for asbestos liabilities asserted against us the results of that litigation may adversely affect our insurance coverage for those risks in addition we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain risk such as political risks terrorism or war 

our businesses may be subject to increased regulatory enforcement 

some of our business segments operate in industries with a concentrated number of competitors and customers both foreign and domestic while we have adopted a corporatewide compliance program we may become the subject of antitrust or other governmental investigations from many jurisdictions which may adversely impact our reputation or our ability to make and sell products in the future

since 2002 we have had excess manufacturing capacity in our telecommunications segment and have not utilized a portion of space in the facilities listed above the largest unused portion is our optical fiber manufacturing facility in concord north carolina that was mothballed in 2002 as a result of lowered demand of optical fiber products in 2007 we reopened a portion of the concord north carolina facility as a result of volume growth in the optical fiber market 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

environmental litigation corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party at 19 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by the agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants corning has accrued approximately 21 million undiscounted for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and litigation at december 31 2008 based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 

dow corning bankruptcy corning and dow chemical each own 50 of the common stock of dow corning in may 1995 dow corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousands of breast implant product lawsuits on june 1 2004 dow corning emerged from chapter 11 with a plan of reorganization the plan which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims the plan also includes releases for corning and dow chemical as shareholders in exchange for contributions to the plan 

  

under the terms of the plan dow corning has established and is funding a settlement trust and a litigation facility to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate their claims inclusive of insurance dow corning has paid approximately 16 billion to the settlement trust as of december 31 2008 dow corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of 16 billion and anticipates insurance receivables of 56 million as a separate matter arising from the bankruptcy proceedings dow corning is defending claims asserted by a number of commercial creditors who claim additional interest at default rates and enforcement costs during the period from may 1995 through june 2004 as of december 31 2008 dow corning has estimated the liability to commercial creditors to be within the range of 79 million to 231 million as dow corning management believes no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range dow corning has recorded the minimum liability within the range should dow corning not prevail in this matter corning’s equity earnings would be reduced by its 50 share of the amount in excess of 79 million net of applicable tax benefits in addition the london market insurers the “lmi claimants” have claimed a reimbursement right with respect to a portion of insurance proceeds previously paid by the lmi claimants to dow corning this claim is based on a theory that the lmi claimants overestimated dow corning’s liability for the resolution of implant claims pursuant to the plan the lmi claimants offered two calculations of their claim amount 54 million and 93 million plus minimum interest of 67 million and 116 million respectively these estimates were explicitly characterized as preliminary and subject to change litigation regarding this claim is in the discovery stage dow corning disputes the claim and is unable to reasonably estimate any potential liability there are a number of other claims in the bankruptcy proceedings against dow corning awaiting resolution by the us district court and it is reasonably possible that dow corning may record bankruptcyrelated charges in the future there are no remaining tort claims against corning other than those that will be channeled by the plan into facilities established by the plan or otherwise defended by the litigation facility 

pittsburgh corning corporation corning and ppg industries inc ppg each own 50 of the capital stock of pittsburgh corning corporation pcc over a period of more than two decades pcc and several other defendants have been named in numerous lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos on april 16 2000 pcc filed for chapter 11 reorganization in the us bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania at the time pcc filed for bankruptcy protection there were approximately 12400 claims pending against corning in state court lawsuits alleging various theories of liability based on exposure to pcc’s asbestos products and typically requesting monetary damages in excess of one million dollars per claim corning has defended those claims on the basis of the separate corporate status of pcc and the absence of any facts supporting claims of direct liability arising from pcc’s asbestos products corning is also currently involved in approximately 10300 other cases approximately 41500 claims alleging injuries from asbestos and similar amounts of monetary damages per case those cases have been covered by insurance without material impact to corning to date as described below several of corning’s insurance carriers have filed a legal proceeding concerning the extent of any insurance coverage for these claims asbestos litigation is inherently difficult and past trends in resolving these claims may not be indicators of future outcomes 

on march 28 2003 corning announced that it had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the resolution of all current and future asbestos claims against it and pittsburgh corning corporation pcc which might arise from pcc products or operations the 2003 plan the 2003 plan would have required corning to relinquish its equity interest in pcc contribute its equity interest in pittsburgh corning europe nv pce a belgian corporation contribute 25 million shares of corning common stock and pay a total of 140 million in six annual installments present value 131 million at march 2003 beginning one year after the plan’s effective date with 55 percent interest from june 2004 in addition the 2003 plan provided that corning would assign certain insurance policy proceeds from its primary insurance and a portion of its excess insurance 

on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court issued an order denying confirmation of the 2003 plan for reasons it set out in a memorandum opinion several parties including corning filed motions for reconsideration these motions were argued on march 5 2007 and the bankruptcy court reserved decision 

on january 10 2008 some of the parties in the proceeding advised the bankruptcy court that they had made substantial progress on an amended plan of reorganization the amended pcc plan that resolved issues raised by the court in denying the confirmation of the 2003 plan and that would therefore make it unnecessary for the bankruptcy court to decide the motion for reconsideration on march 27 2008 and may 22 2008 the parties further informed the bankruptcy court on the progress toward the amended pcc plan the parties filed a partial tentative plan on august 8 2008 the parties continued to inform the bankruptcy court of the status of their discussions on the amended pcc plan the complete proposed amended pcc plan and its ancillary documents were filed with the bankruptcy court on january 29 2009 

  

as a result corning believes the amended pcc plan now represents the most probable outcome of this matter and expects that such a proposed amended pcc plan will be confirmed by the court at the same time corning believes the 2003 plan no longer serves as the basis for the company’s best estimate of liability key provisions of the proposed amended pcc plan address the concerns expressed by the bankruptcy court accordingly in the first quarter of 2008 corning adjusted its asbestos litigation liability to reflect components of the amended pcc plan the proposed resolution of pcc asbestos claims under the amended pcc plan requires corning to contribute its equity interests in pcc and pce and to contribute a fixed series of payments recorded at present value on december 31 2008 corning will have the option to use its shares rather than cash to make these payments but the liability is fixed by dollar value and not the number of shares the proposed amended plan would require corning to make one payment of 100 million one year from the date the amended pcc plan becomes effective and certain conditions are met and five additional payments of 50 million each on subsequent anniversaries of the first payment subject to credits applicable under certain circumstances to corning’s final 50 million payment 

the amended pcc plan does not include nonpcc asbestos claims that may be or have been raised against corning corning has recorded an additional 150 million for such claims in its estimated asbestos litigation liability the liability for nonpcc claims was estimated based upon industry data for asbestos claims since corning does not have recent claim history due to the injunction issued by the pcc bankruptcy court the estimated liability represents the undiscounted projection of claims and related legal fees over the next 20 years the amount may need to be adjusted in future periods as more companyspecific data becomes available 

the amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies payment of the amounts required to fund the amended pcc plan from insurance and other sources are subject to a number of conditions which may not be achieved the approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is not certain and may face objections by some parties any approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is subject to appeal the proposed amended pcc plan will also be subject to a vote of pcc’s creditors for these and other reasons corning’s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters the estimate of the cost of resolving the nonpcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning’s financial statements is remote 

several of corning’s insurers have commenced litigation for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies including rights that may be affected by the potential resolutions described above corning is vigorously contesting these cases management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation and therefore cannot estimate the range of any possible loss

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

organization of information 

management’s discussion and analysis provides a historical and prospective narrative on the company’s financial condition and results of operations this discussion includes the following sections 

 

        overview 

corning delivered improved operating results for the full year of 2008 although results for the first and second half of the year were dramatically different in the first half of 2008 our performance reflected strength in the majority of our segments while the downturn in global economic activity and disruption in the financial markets negatively impacted our performance in the second half declines in consumer retail markets caused a significant decrease in demand for products of our display and environmental technologies segments during 2008 the company responded to the economic conditions that have affected demand for our products by scaling back manufacturing operations curbing the rate of growth in research development and engineering expenses reducing capital spending and reducing operating costs in january corning announced restructuring charges in the range of 115 million to 165 million primarily for costs associated with workforce reductions that will take place in 2009 

corning’s strategy to grow through global innovation while preserving our financial independence has served us well our key priorities for 2008 were unchanged from the previous three years protect our financial health improve our profitability and invest in the future we made significant progress on these priorities in 2008 

financial health 

despite the uncertainty in the global economic environment our financial position remained sound and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities significant items in 2008 included the following 

 

   profitability 

for the year ended december 31 2008 we generated net income of 53 billion or 332 per share compared to net income of 22 billion or 134 per share for 2007 when compared to last year the 31 billion improvement in net income was due largely to the following items 

 

     

investing in our future 

we continue to focus on the future and on what we do best  creating and making keystone components that enable hightechnology systems we remain committed to investing in research development and engineering to drive innovation in 2008 approximately onethird of our total research development and engineering expenditures was for research and new business development this spending related to our existing businesses new business development exploratory research and early stage marketing we continue to work on technologies for glass substrates for active matrix lcds diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that will enable fibertothepremises we continue to make investments in promising technologies such as the epic™ system synthetic green lasers silicononglass microreactors thinfilm photovoltaics and mercury abatement 

our research development and engineering expenditures increased by 62 million in 2008 when compared to 2007 but remained fairly constant as a percentage of net sales the largest driver of increased spending was for the development of new businesses we believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies 

our capital expenditures have been primarily focused on expanding manufacturing capacity in the display technologies segment in anticipation of a larger display market in 2010 and growing demand for corning’s gorilla™ glass an optical quality glass that is optimized for highend portable devices and touch screens in december 2007 we announced a 5year capital expenditure plan to locate a glass manufacturing facility at sharp corporation’s plant in sakai city japan in february 2008 we announced a 453 million expansion of our lcd manufacturing facility in taichung taiwan given the dramatic changes to the global economic landscape and resulting decline in demand for our products we have stopped further expansion in taiwan we have however continued to advance our project in sakai city to align with sharp corporation’s progress on their adjoining facility higher precious metals prices also impacted the growth in capital spending total capital expenditures for 2008 were 19 billion of which 14 billion was directed toward our display technologies segment and 155 million was invested in our environmental technologies segment 

we expect our 2009 capital spending to be about 11 billion approximately 700 million will be directed toward our display technologies segment of which about 525 million relates to construction completed in 2008 

corporate outlook 

for 2009 we believe our sales and profitability will continue to be negatively impacted by the global economic recession the restructuring plan we announced in january 2009 sizes the company to be profitable at a 5 billion sales level although the current run rate of our sales is about 4 billion we believe that 5 billion of sales is possible assuming the supply chain contraction in our display technologies segment ends by the second quarter of 2009 if we do not see an increase in our sales by the second quarter we will take additional restructuring actions 

during these difficult economic times the company is focused on three priorities preserving cash restructuring the company to be profitable at a lower sales level and accelerating new products while maintaining our emphasis on research and development investments for longer term growth 

although there is much uncertainty as we head into 2009 we are confident about our financial health and the strength of our balance sheet we remain confident that our strategy to grow through global innovation while preserving our financial stability will enable our continued longterm success 

  

results of operations 

selected highlights from our continuing operations follow dollars in millions 

 

 net sales 

net sales in 2008 were up slightly when compared to 2007 primarily due to the positive impact of 354 million from the movement in foreign exchange rates offset by volume and price declines in a number of our segments our sales results followed the changing global economic conditions during the year net sales for the first half of 2008 were up 21 when compared with the first half of 2007 but down 16 for the second half of 2008 when compared to the second half of 2007 as the lcd glass market experienced a supply chain contraction that worsened with deteriorating economic conditions declines in consumer spending reduced demand for lcd televisions and monitors and automotive products in the second half of 2008 

the net sales increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily the result of increased volume in the display technologies environmental technologies and telecommunications segments movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on 2007 net sales when compared with 2006 

in 2008 net sales into international markets continued to surpass those into the us market for 2008 sales into international markets accounted for 74 of net sales for 2007 and 2006 sales into international markets accounted for 72 and 71 respectively of net sales 

cost of sales 

the types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are raw materials consumption including direct and indirect materials salaries wages and benefits depreciation and amortization production utilities productionrelated purchasing warehousing including receiving and inspection repairs and maintenance interlocation inventory transfer costs production and warehousing facility property insurance rent for production facilities and other production overhead 

  

gross margin 

for 2008 gross margin in dollars and as a percentage of net sales was relatively even when compared with 2007 although gross margin was comparable on a full year basis in 2008 our gross margin percent remained above 47 in each of the first three quarters and then fell to 28 in the fourth quarter the decline in gross margin in the fourth quarter resulted from significantly lower volume in our display technologies telecommunications and environmental technologies segments the impact of excess idle capacity costs and accelerated depreciation as we idled the manufacturing capacity in our display technologies segment by more than 50 

for 2007 gross margin improved both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales when compared with 2006 improvements were driven by strong sales in the display technologies telecommunications and environmental technologies segments along with cost reduction efforts and manufacturing efficiencies 

selling general and administrative expenses 

the slight decrease in selling general and administrative expenses for 2008 when compared to 2007 in dollars resulted from a decrease in performancebased compensation costs caused by the impact of the decline in profitability in most of our operating segments in the second half of 2008 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses for 2007 when compared to 2006 in dollars was largely due to an increase in compensationrelated expenses as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses in 2007 declined slightly when compared to 2006 due to cost control efforts 

the types of expenses included in the selling general and administrative expenses line item are salaries wages and benefits travel sales commissions professional fees and depreciation and amortization utilities and rent for administrative facilities 

restructuring impairment and other charges and credits 

corning recorded restructuring impairment and other charges and credits in 2008 and in 2006 which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented a description of those charges follows 

2008 restructuring actions 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded 22 million of severance costs primarily for a restructuring plan in the telecommunications segment 

2006 impairment charge for assets held for use 

in 2006 we recorded an asset held for use impairment charge of 44 million to impair certain longlived assets of our telecommunications segment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” sfas 144 due to our lowered longterm outlook for this business  we determined that an event of impairment as defined by sfas 144 had occurred in that business which further required us to test this asset group for impairment we assess recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we estimated the fair value of the longlived assets for this business using a discounted expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value as a result of our impairment evaluation we recorded an impairment charge to writedown the asset group to its estimated fair value 

asbestos litigation 

in the first quarter of 2008 corning recorded a credit to asbestos litigation expense of 327 million as a result of the increase in likelihood of a settlement under the amended pcc plan and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under the 2003 plan for the remainder of 2008 corning recorded net credit adjustments of 13 million to reflect the change in value of the estimated liability under an amended pcc plan the liability for the amended pcc plan and the nonpcc asbestos claims was estimated to be 662 million at december 31 2008 compared with an estimate of liability under the original 2003 plan of 10 billion at december 31 2007 the entire obligation is classified as a noncurrent liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than 12 months after the amended pcc plan is ultimately confirmed and the pce portion of the obligation will be fulfilled through the direct contribution of corning’s investment in pce currently recorded as a noncurrent other equity method investment 

since march 28 2003 we have recorded total net charges of 662 million to reflect the initial asbestos liability and subsequent adjustments for the change in the value of the components of the liability 

see legal proceedings for additional information about this matter 

  

other expense income net 

“other expense income net” in corning’s consolidated statements of income includes the following in millions 

 

 income before income taxes 

in addition to the items identified under gross margin restructuring impairment and other charges and credits asbestos litigation credit charges and other expense income net movements in foreign exchange rates also impacted results for the years presented in 2008 income before income taxes included 35 million for the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates in 2007 and 2006 income before income taxes was negatively impacted by 19 million and 41 million respectively by movements in foreign exchange rates 

provision for income taxes 

our benefit provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows in millions 

 

 the effective income tax benefit rate for 2008 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

 

    the effective income tax rates for 2007 and 2006 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

 

   prior to 2006 we recorded valuation allowances against our entire us deferred tax assets as a result of significant losses in the us in both 2007 and 2006 we generated income from continuing operations in the us the tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of the valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of us income 

in 2008 we concluded that it was more likely than not that we will realize substantially all of our us deferred tax assets because we expect to generate sufficient levels of income in the us as a result we released 24 billion of valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2008 we considered all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence a valuation allowance was needed the evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets is inherently subjective following are the key items that provided positive evidence to support the release of the valuation allowance for a large portion of our deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2008 

  

    in accordance with sfas 109 in the second half of 2008 we utilized a portion of the remaining valuation allowance to offset us income tax expense or benefit that would otherwise have been recorded on income or losses in the us in 2008 and therefore reflected no net us income tax expense in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 we released an additional 70 million and 45 million respectively of valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets as a result of a change in our estimate of currentyear us taxable income in 2009 we will begin providing us income tax expense or benefit on earnings losses 

in 2008 2007 and 2006 we generated income from continuing operations in the us the tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of our existing valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of us income the impact of the release of the valuation allowances and thus not recording tax expense on income generated in the us was a reduction in our effective tax rate of 162 for 2008 and 142 for both 2007 and 2006 

certain shorterlived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss carry forwards and state tax net operating loss carry forwards as well as other federal and state tax credits will remain with a valuation allowance recorded against them as of december 31 2008 because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire the amount of us and foreign deferred tax assets that have valuation allowances at december 31 2008 was 230 million 

we do not provide income taxes on the post1992 earnings of domestic subsidiaries that we expect to recover taxfree without significant cost income taxes have been provided for post1992 unremitted earnings of domestic corporate joint ventures that we do not expect to recover taxfree unremitted earnings of domestic subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that arose in fiscal years beginning on or before december 31 1992 have been indefinitely reinvested we currently provide us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies to the extent these earnings are currently taxable or expected to be remitted as of december 31 2008 us taxes have not been provided on approximately 66 billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings which are expected to remain invested indefinitely 

in 2004 we recorded valuation allowances against our entire german and australian deferred tax assets due to losses in recent years in 2007 due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections for our overall german operations we concluded that it is more likely than not that the german national deferred tax assets are realizable and that the related valuation allowance was no longer required in 2006 due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections in australia and at certain of our german operations we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of the german local and the entire australian deferred tax assets were realizable and that the related valuation allowances were no longer required the impact of the releases of the valuation allowances on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 124 and 87 for 2007 and 2006 respectively 

certain foreign subsidiaries in china and taiwan are or were operating under tax holiday arrangements the nature and extent of such arrangements vary and the benefits of such arrangements phase out in years 2006 to 2012 according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 101 121 and 101 for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively

equity in earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments 

the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments in millions 

 

 the 2008 and 2007 increases in equity earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments reflected strong sales and earnings performance at samsung corning precision and at dow corning when compared to the previous years the change in equity earnings from samsung corning precision is explained in the discussion of the performance of the display technologies segment and in all other 

dow corning’s 2008 performance was driven by sales growth in its traditional silicone product lines and in polysilicones for the semiconductor and solar energy industries dow corning sales grew 10 in 2008 with the largest growth at hemlock semiconductor dow corning’s consolidated joint venture that makes high purity polycrystalline for the semiconductor and solar energy industries sales of dow corning’s traditional silicone product lines were also higher when compared to last year net income at dow corning and corning’s resulting equity earnings from dow corning increased 7 in 2008 when compared to 2007 reflecting the growth in net sales along with the positive impact from both a change in depreciation method and a change in the useful lives of certain fixed assets offset in part by an otherthantemporary impairment for certain securities of fannie mae and freddie mac our share of this impairment was 18 million although dow corning’s full year results increased yearoveryear sales and earnings declined significantly in the fourth quarter when compared to the first three quarters of the year as demand in its silicone product lines fell dramatically 

in 2007 dow corning’s sales grew approximately 13 when compared with the prior year due to growth in net sales from both their silicone and polysilicone product lines equity earnings from dow corning in 2007 were up 3 when compared to 2006 due to the increase in sales offset in part by the nonrepeat of a 33 million favorable irs settlement in 2006 dow corning reached a settlement with the irs regarding liabilities for tax years 1992 to 2003 equity earnings reflected a 33 million gain as a result of the settlement which resolved all federal tax issues related to dow corning’s implant settlement 

sales at dow corning are expected to be lower in 2009 when compared to 2008 driven by lower sales of silicone products offset somewhat by an increase in sales at hemlock semiconductor consequently dow corning’s net income and corning’s equity in earnings from dow corning is expected to be lower as well 

until december 31 2007 corning had a 50 interest in samsung corning samsung electronics company ltd and affiliates owned the remaining 50 interest in samsung corning on december 31 2007 samsung corning precision acquired all of the outstanding shares of samsung corning after the transaction corning retained its 50 interest in samsung corning precision in 2007 equity earnings from samsung corning were reduced by 40 million primarily due to restructuring and impairment charges 

net income 

as a result of the items discussed above net income and per share data was as follows in millions except per share amounts 

 

   

operating segments 

effective january 1 2008 corning changed its internal reporting structure to better reflect the company’s focus on new business development and laterstage research projects and to provide more transparency on our specialty materials operating segment as a result our segment reporting includes the following changes which are in accordance with sfas 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” 

 

   our reportable operating segments are now as follows 

 

     all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “all other” this group is primarily comprised of development projects and results for new product lines 

we prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions we included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segment’s net income we have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for standalone financial information prepared in accordance with gaap segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements 

display technologies 

dollars in millions 

 

 2008 vs 2007 

the net sales increase for the display technologies segment in 2008 resulted from a slight improvement in volume measured in square feet of glass sold along with a 294 million positive impact from movements in foreign exchange rates offset by price declines of 7 when compared to 2007 net sales of this segment are denominated in japanese yen and as a result are susceptible to movements in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate in the first half of 2008 glass volume of this segment increased by 37 when compared to the same period in 2007 driven by lcd television market growth and demand for lcd monitors and notebook computers because corning sells to panel makers and not to end market consumers supply chain expansion and contraction for this industry is a key factor in corning’s volume during 2008 the lcd glass market underwent a supply chain contraction in the second half of the year that worsened as global economic conditions deteriorated and demand rapidly declined consequently in the second half of 2008 our lcd glass volume declined by 27 when compared to the second half of 2007 the largest decline in our glass volume occurred in the fourth quarter when volume fell about 50 when compared to the prior year 

  

the overall lcd glass market grew approximately 15 in 2008 growth rates by region differed dramatically resulting in volume in our whollyowned business increasing only 1 while volume at samsung corning precision in korea increased 28 compared to 2007 the lower growth rate in our whollyowned business was caused in part by a decline in volume in taiwan particularly in the second half of the year reflecting a number of key market dynamics first taiwanese panel makers do not have as strong of brand recognition with consumers as do korean and japanese panel makers in addition a number of taiwanese panel makers provide capacity to customers that also produce their own lcd panels and as demand has slowed purchases of this excess capacity have declined fluctuating exchange rates also appear to have made korean panel makers more competitive during the industry downturn finally we believe the taiwanese panel makers had to reduce production to align their inventory levels with lower demand 

when compared to the prior year income before equity earnings for 2008 was down 8 primarily due to lower volume and price declines offset somewhat by the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates and strong manufacturing performance earlier in the year during the first half of 2008 operating performance benefited from manufacturing facilities that were running at or near capacity as demand leveled off in the third quarter and then sharply declined in the fourth quarter we temporarily idled certain production assets these actions resulted in accelerated depreciation for glass tanks that were taken out of production earlier than planned by the end of 2008 more than half of the manufacturing capacity in our whollyowned business was temporarily idled this capacity is expected to be brought back online when demand increases which could be as early as the second quarter of 2009 

equity earnings from samsung corning precision’s lcd business for 2008 increased by 55 when compared to 2007 due to volume gains of 28 improved manufacturing performance and the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates offset somewhat by price declines of 9 samsung corning precision experienced a similar but less severe decline in second half performance at the end of 2008 samsung corning precision had idled approximately 25 of its capacity equity earnings for 2008 were positively impacted by approximately 210 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2007 equity earnings from samsung corning precision are impacted by movements in both the us dollar  japanese yen and us dollar  korean won exchange rates 

the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan and taiwan for 2008 auo chi mei optoelectronics corporation and sharp corporation which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for 65 of total segment sales when combined 

in addition samsung corning precision’s sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers in 2008 sales to two lcd panel makers located in korea  samsung electronics co ltd and lg phillips lcd co ltd  accounted for approximately 94 of samsung corning precision sales 

2007 vs 2006 

the net sales increase for 2007 reflected volume gains of 38 offset somewhat by price declines of 11 when compared to 2006 volume gains were driven by increased lcd monitor demand continued demand for glass for notebook computers and lcd television market growth the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on this segment’s net sales was not material in 2007 when compared to 2006 

when compared with 2006 income before equity earnings for 2007 was up significantly due to higher net sales lower manufacturing costs and an increase in royalty income from samsung corning precision 

equity earnings for 2007 increased by 3 when compared to 2006 due to volume gains of 39 at samsung corning precision offset by price declines of 15 and increased operating and royalty expenses the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on equity earnings was not material in 2007 when compared to 2006 

other information 

corning has invested heavily to expand capacity to meet the demand for lcd glass substrates in 2008 and 2007 capital spending in this segment was 14 billion and 883 million respectively we expect capital spending for 2009 to be approximately 700 million of which 525 million relates to construction completed in 2008 

corning licenses certain of its patents and knowhow to samsung corning precision as well as to third parties which generates royalty income refer to note 7 investments to the consolidated financial statements for more information about royalty income from samsung corning precision and related party transactions 

  

in 2005 and 2004 several of corning’s customers entered into longterm purchase and supply agreements in which corning’s display technologies segment would supply largesize glass substrates to these customers over periods of up to six years as part of the agreements these customers agreed to advance cash deposits to corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased we received our last deposit of 105 million in july 2007 and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements in 2006 we received 171 million of customer deposits during 2008 2007 and 2006 we issued 266 million 231 million and 126 million respectively in credits that were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due in the event customers do not purchase the agreed upon quantities of product subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits if corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements corning may be required to return certain amounts of our customers’ deposits refer to note 10 other liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

outlook 

we expect the display technologies segment to continue to be impacted by the global recession in the first quarter of 2009 we expect the supply chain contraction to continue and volume to be down in the range of 20 to 25 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 we also expect price declines in the high single digits as part of the corporatewide restructuring plan we will reduce our worldwide workforce in this segment in the first quarter 

with continued growth in demand at retail we anticipate significant volume improvement in the second quarter of 2009 and we anticipate the rate of price declines will return to more normal levels 

we expect the overall lcd glass market in 2009 will be flat with 2008 resulting from an increase in demand for lcd televisions and notebook computers offset by falling demand for lcd monitors in addition we expect regional mix shifts as described above may cause an increase in volume at samsung corning precision with a corresponding decrease in volume for corning’s wholly owned business although the lcd supply chain has been impacted by the current global recession we believe that the longterm drivers of this market specifically increased penetration of lcd into the total television market increased screen size and increased televisions per household remain intact 

the end market demand for lcd televisions monitors and notebooks is dependent on consumer retail spending among other things we are cautious about the potential negative impacts that economic conditions particularly the global economic recession and world political tensions could have on consumer demand while the industry has grown rapidly in recent years economic volatility along with consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes prices or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth therefore it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time in addition changes in foreign exchange rates principally the japanese yen will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment if we do not experience the expected recovery in volume in the second quarter we may incur further charges to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity 

telecommunications 

dollars in millions 

 

 2008 vs 2007 

net sales for the segment were up slightly over 2007 primarily due to volume gains in fibertothepremises products and the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates increased sales in fibertothepremises products reflected strong demand in europe and north america the increase was partially offset by moderating price declines reduced demand for copper based products in europe and the absence of sales from corning’s european submarine cabling business which was sold in april 2007 

  

effective april 30 2007 corning sold its european submarine cabling business and effective april 1 2006 advance cable systems acs currently an equity company affiliate assumed responsibility for optical cable and hardware and equipment sales in japan as a result of these two transactions sales for 2008 2007 and 2006 are not comparable 

dollars in millions 

 

 net income in 2008 included 22 million for the cost of a restructuring plan that was implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008 the decline in net income in 2008 reflected the impact of the restructuring charge price declines higher operating expenses and the absence of a 19 million gain on the sale of the european submarine cabling business when compared to last year in 2008 movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the net income of this segment 

the telecommunications segment has a concentrated customer base in 2008 two customers of the telecommunications segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of total segment net sales accounted for 24 of total segment sales when combined 

2007 vs 2006 

segment net sales in 2007 were favorably impacted by growth in the telecommunications industry and in the private network market growth in the public and private markets had a favorable impact on both optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment product sales in 2007 corning introduced the clearcurve ™ ultrabendable optical fiberbased suite of products that enable fiber deployments to multidwelling units in 2007 optical fiber market volume exceeded the previous market peak which occurred in 2001 confirming a recovery from the 2002 global telecommunications market downturn volume increases in 2007 were offset somewhat by price declines when compared to the previous year in addition 2007 net sales were positively impacted by 37 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates primarily the euro when compared to 2006 

telecommunications segment net sales excluding the impact of sales of submarine cabling products and sales of optical cable in japan increased 10 percent in 2007 when compared to 2006 segment net sales excluding the impact of submarine cabling products and sales of optical cable in japan is a nongaap financial measure which management believes is useful to investors to understand the yearoveryear growth of this segment’s net sales the reconciliation of this non gaap measure is included in the table above 

net income in 2007 increased when compared to 2006 due to improvements in segment sales cost reductions the impact of the 19 million gain on the sale of the european submarine cabling business and the absence of an impairment charge which totaled 44 million in 2006 a favorable mix for optical fiber and cable products also contributed to improvements in segment net income in 2007 net income of this segment was positively impacted by 3 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared with 2006 

outlook 

we expect the telecommunications segment to be negatively impacted by the global recession with sales in 2009 lower than in 2008 in addition to the fourth quarter restructuring charge additional charges will be incurred in this segment in the first quarter of 2009 restructuring actions include a reduction in manufacturing sales and administrative and development and engineering workforces and a consolidation of manufacturing operations that will result in the closure of two plants with productive capacity and headcount being increased at another facility 

changes in our customers’ expected deployment plans or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fibertothepremises products could also affect sales levels should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated our sales and earnings would be adversely affected 

  

environmental technologies 

dollars in millions 

 

 2008 vs 2007 

sales of the environmental technologies segment in 2008 were down 6 when compared to the previous year and reflected lower sales of automotive and diesel products offset somewhat by favorable foreign exchange rate movements sales of automotive products reflected the significant decline in demand in the european and us automotive industry in the second half of 2008 in line with worsening economic conditions diesel product sales increased due to the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates offset somewhat by volume declines diesel product sales reflect the continued decline in the us freight industry which began in late 2007 net sales of this segment in 2008 were positively impacted by 24 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year 

net income of this segment was down when compared to last year due primarily to reduced sales volumes and manufacturing inefficiencies in both businesses net income was positively impacted by 3 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year 

the environmental technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of manufacturers of catalyzers and emission control systems who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers although our sales are mainly to the emission control systems manufacturers the use of substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel engine manufacturers in 2008 three customers of the environmental technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for 81 of total segment sales 

2007 vs 2006 

sales of the environmental technologies segment in 2007 were higher when compared to 2006 due to increased sales from the diesel product lines and strong demand for automotive substrates diesel sales in 2007 reflected increased sales of heavy duty diesel products to meet the us emission regulations which went into effect on january 2 2007 sales of automotive products also improved when compared to last year due to an increase in sales to european and asian customers net sales of this segment were positively impacted by 23 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year 

net income of this segment was up when compared to last year due to higher sales manufacturing efficiencies and the impact of favorable movements in foreign exchange rates offset slightly by modest price declines improved utilization of our diesel manufacturing capacity also contributed to increased net income in this segment net income was positively impacted by 5 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year 

outlook 

we expect performance of this segment in 2009 will continue to be negatively impacted by the global recession in addition results will be impacted by changes in the automotive industry and in the status of north america’s largest automakers we are forecasting net sales of this segment to be lower in 2009 when compared to 2008 with declines in both automotive and diesel businesses as part of the corporatewide restructuring plan we will reduce our worldwide workforce in this segment in the first quarter of 2009 

specialty materials 

dollars in millions 

 

   

2008 vs 2007 

the specialty materials segment manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs consequently this segment operates in a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets that include display optics and components semiconductor optics and components aerospace and defense astronomy ophthalmic products and telecommunications components 

when compared to the previous year net sales were down 2 in 2008 due to a decline in sales of semiconductor materials products which were negatively impacted by the global recession offset somewhat by increased sales of gorilla ™ glass and the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates gorilla ™ glass is corning’s optical quality glass that is optimized for highend portable devices and touch screens the increase in net loss for this segment was due to the decline in sales along with higher operating expenses for gorilla ™ glass 

for 2008 one customer of the specialty materials segment accounted for 11 of total segment sales 

2007 vs 2006 

net sales for 2007 reflected a decline in semiconductor materials products offset somewhat by growth in sales of gorilla ™ glass when compared to 2006 the decline in net income for 2007 reflected the decline in sales along with an increase in manufacturing costs 

outlook 

although we expect sales of gorilla ™ glass to continue to improve sales of this segment for 2009 are expected to be down reflecting the overall decline in economic conditions when compared to 2008 we expect to see a continued decline in sales of semiconductor materials products and declines in advanced optical products as part of the corporatewide restructuring plan we will reduce our worldwide workforce in this segment in the first quarter of 2009 

life sciences 

dollars in millions 

 

 2008 vs 2007 

net sales of the life sciences segment for 2008 were up when compared to 2007 driven by sales growth of scientific laboratory products in all of this segment’s global markets price increases and 8 million from the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates government and private spending for drug development discovery and production continue to drive market growth in this segment the improvement in net income in 2008 reflected the sales increases as described offset somewhat by higher operating expenses 

in the life sciences segment one customer accounted for approximately 45 of this segment’s net sales in 2008 

2007 vs 2006 

net sales of the life sciences segment for 2007 were up when compared to the previous year driven by market growth and higher prices movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of sales for the periods presented improved profitability of this segment in 2007 resulted from higher sales movements in foreign exchange rates manufacturing efficiencies and the absence of restructuring charges movements in foreign exchange rates had a 4 million favorable impact on results of this segment for 2007 when compared with 2006 

outlook 

sales of the life sciences segment for 2009 are expected to be flat to up slightly when compared to 2008 

  

all other 

dollars in millions 

 

 2008 vs 2007 

all other includes all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting this group is primarily comprised of development projects such as microreactors and synthetic green lasers and results for new product lines such as the epic ™ system in 2008 the increase in net loss reflected higher spending for new development projects and a 14 million loss on the sale of corning’s steuben glass business offset somewhat by the absence of restructuring and impairment charges in 2007 equity earnings of all other included 40 million for our share of restructuring and impairment charges for samsung corning precision’s nonlcd businesses 

2007 vs 2006 

in 2007 the increase in net loss resulted from higher spending for new development projects and the impact of restructuring and impairment charges for samsung corning precision’s nonlcd businesses

liquidity and capital resources 

financing and capital structure 

the following items impacted corning’s financing and capital structure during 2008 

 

  we have a revolving credit facility that provides us access to a 11 billion unsecured multicurrency revolving line of credit through march 2011 the facility includes two financial covenants a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio at december 31 2008 we were in compliance with both financial covenants 

capital spending 

capital spending totaled 19 billion 13 billion and 12 billion in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively capital spending activity in all three years primarily included expansion of lcd glass capacity in the display technologies segment and new capacity for diesel products in the environmental technologies segment our 2009 capital spending program is expected to be approximately 11 billion with approximately 700 million for spending related to manufacturing capacity for lcd glass substrates in the display technologies segment approximately 525 million of the display technologies spending relates to construction completed in 2008 additionally approximately 100 million will be directed toward our environmental technologies segment to support the diesel emissions control products 

  

cash flows 

summary of cash flow data 

 

 2008 vs 2007 

as the significant increase in 2008 net income was largely driven by two noncash items 2008 operating cash increased only slightly when compared to 2007 the two noncash items were the release of 25 billion of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and a 340 million reduction in asbestos related liabilities 

in addition cash from operating activities benefited from slower growth in working capital higher dividends from equity affiliates and lower contributions for retirementrelated benefits compared to 2007 these benefits were partially offset by an increase in taxes paid and customer deposit credits issued 

net cash used in investing activities in 2008 increased when compared to the previous year due to a 659 million increase in capital spending largely attributable to higher spending in the display technologies segment and a smaller reduction in shortterm investments compared to 2007 

net cash used in financing activities was higher when compared to the previous year due to an increase in repurchases of common stock and an increase in dividends paid corning began paying a quarterly dividend of 005 per share in the third quarter of 2007 

2007 vs 2006 

net cash from operating activities in 2007 increased when compared to 2006 due primarily to higher earnings after adjusting for noncash items and increased dividends from equity affiliates 

net cash used in investing activities in 2007 was lower than 2006 due to a net reduction in shortterm investments compared to a net increase in 2006 this change reflected a shift away from certain shortterm investments to reduce investment risk 

corning had net cash outflows from financing activities in 2007 compared to net cash inflows in 2006 reflecting the company’s stock repurchase program and dividend payments  both of which began in 2007 and reduced cash inflows from the exercise of stock options 

defined benefit pension plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees our largest single pension plan is corning’s us qualified plan at december 31 2008 this plan accounted for 83 of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation and 91 of the related plans’ assets 

we have traditionally contributed to the us qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the irs minimum requirements and as a result mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until some time after 2010 in 2008 we made voluntary cash contributions of 50 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and 2 million to our international pension plans in 2007 we made voluntary cash contributions of 131 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and 18 million to our international pension plans 

in 2008 we experienced significant negative returns on our pension assets for our primary defined benefit plan as a result of recent financial market conditions which will increase pension expense for 2009 by 33 million we anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of approximately 80 million to our domestic and international pension plans in 2009 we do not expect to have required contributions in 2009 

refer to note 12 employee retirement plans to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

customer deposits 

certain customers of our display technologies segment have entered into longterm supply agreements and have agreed to make advance cash deposits to secure supply of largesize glass substrates the deposits will be reduced through future product purchases thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods 

between 2004 and 2007 we received a total of 937 million for customer deposit agreements we received our last deposit of 105 million in 2007 and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements in 2006 we received 171 million of customer deposits 

in 2008 2007 and 2006 we issued credit memoranda which totaled 266 million 231 million and 126 million respectively these credit amounts were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due customer deposit liabilities were 369 million and 531 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively in 2009 we expect to issue approximately 287 million in credit memoranda 

restructuring 

during 2008 2007 and 2006 we made payments of 17 million 39 million and 15 million respectively related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded a 22 million restructuring charge primarily for severance costs in our telecommunications segment cash payments for employeerelated costs will be substantially completed by the end of 2009 while payments for exit activities will be substantially completed by the end of 2010 on january 26 2009 corning committed to corporatewide restructuring actions which will result in first quarter charges in the range of 115 million to 165 million pretax in addition to the fourth quarter restructuring charges of 22 million in total corning plans to reduce its workforce by 3500 employees and expects to complete this restructuring plan by the end of 2009 corning made the decision to restructure to adjust operations to reflect anticipated lower sales in 2009 the program will include a selective early retirement program global workforce reductions and consolidation of manufacturing facilities total cash expenditures are expected to be roughly 105 million to 150 million primarily related to termination benefits

credit ratings 

as of february 24 2009 our credit ratings were as follows 

 

 management assessment of liquidity 

the company has adequate sources of liquidity and we are confident in our ability to generate cash to meet existing or reasonably likely future cash requirements we ended 2008 with approximately 28 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments approximately 15 billion or 54 of the total balance was invested in money market funds governmentbacked securities or bank deposits and had average maturities of one day at december 31 2008 approximately 42 of the company’s investments were located in the us in january 2009 we repatriated an additional 400 million of cash into the us 

in 2008 we recorded 53 million of realized losses on shortterm investments which represented less than 6 of our total holdings of availableforsale securities refer to note 3 shortterm investments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

like many other highlyrated issuers that have enjoyed consistent access to the public capital markets the recent turmoil in those financial markets may limit corning’s access constrain issuance amounts available to corning and result in terms and conditions that by historical standards are more restrictive and costly to corning still from time to time we may issue debt to refinance debt maturities in the next few years and for general corporate purposes 

in july 2007 corning’s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to 500 million to be completed by the end of 2008 in july 2008 corning announced that its board of directors and executive committee had approved a second stock repurchase program of up to an additional 1 billion to be completed by the end of 2009 through december 31 2008 we have repurchased approximately 40 million shares of common stock for 875 million under these programs we do not intend to make further share repurchases until economic conditions and corning’s cash flow performance improve 

our major source of funding for 2009 and beyond will be our operating cash flow and our existing balances of cash cash equivalents and short term investments we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations the asbestos litigation research and development capital expenditures scheduled debt repayments and dividend payments corning also has access to a 11 billion unsecured committed revolving line of credit through march 2011 this facility includes two financial covenants a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio at december 31 2008 we were in compliance with both financial covenants 

off balance sheet arrangements 

off balance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 

corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include the following 

 

  fin 45 requires a company at the time a guarantee is issued to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant 

  

refer to note 13 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

corning leases certain transportation equipment from three trusts that qualify as variable interest entities under fasb interpretation 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51” fin 46r the sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to corning 

for variable interest entities we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by fin 46r the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of its expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests which are the ownership contractual or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests 

corning has performed the required fin 46r assessments and has identified three entities as being variable interest entities none of these entities are considered to be significant to corning’s consolidated statements of position 

corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit liquidity or market risk support to that entity 

contractual obligations 

the amounts of our obligations follow in millions 

 

  

      we have provided financial guarantees and contingent liabilities in the form of standby letters of credit and performance bonds some of which do not have fixed or scheduled expiration dates we have agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow corning discussed in note 7 investments and note 13 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements the funding of the dow corning credit facility will be required only if dow corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed bankruptcy plan we believe the significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 

  

environment 

we have been named by the environmental protection agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 19 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by such agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is our policy to accrue for the estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by us based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2008 and 2007 we had accrued approximately 21 million undiscounted and 19 million undiscounted respectively for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date we believe that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates that required us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments follow 

impairment of assets held for use 

sfas 144 requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets when an event of impairment has occurred we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in certain circumstances we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

once it has been determined that an impairment has occurred an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the impaired assets to be held and used this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and terminal values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 

restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions 

sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” requires us to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including for example employee termination costs restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses of portions thereof their profitability cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome the judgment involved can be difficult subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses 

restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which as a result require impairment in accordance with sfas 144 sfas 144 requires us to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned 

income taxes 

sfas 109 requires us to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environments in which we do business it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances 

in the second quarter of 2008 we released 24 billion of valuation allowances because we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient levels of profitability in the us to realize substantially all of our us deferred tax assets in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 we released an additional 70 million and 45 million respectively of valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets as a result of a change in our estimate of currentyear us taxable income a significant factor in our forecasts of future us tax profitability is the amount of assumed royalties to be paid by our display technologies businesses to the us 

  

in determining our provision for income taxes we use an annual effective income tax rate based on full year income permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates significant judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide income tax position as well as the effective tax rate 

fair value measures 

the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no157 “fair value measurements” sfas 157 effective january 1 2008 the adoption of sfas 157 was not material to corning’s financial statements or results of operations the statement identifies two kinds of inputs that are used to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the company’s own market assumptions once inputs have been characterized sfas 157 requires companies to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels sfas 157 applies whenever an entity is measuring fair value under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement and requires the use of observable market data when available corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are shortterm and longterm investments and derivatives these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions 

derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts which are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in arriving at the fair value of corning’s derivative assets and liabilities we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction the amount recorded in the first quarter of 2008 related to credit risk was not material 

probability of litigation outcomes 

sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” sfas 5 requires us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter case law and other casespecific issues see part ii  item 1 legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face the most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability including the inherent complexity of a chapter 11 filing our history of success in defending asbestos claims our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants’ representatives the proposed asbestos resolution amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies the approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is not certain and may face objections by some parties any approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is subject to appeal the proposed amended pcc plan will also be subject to a vote of pcc’s creditors for these and other reasons corning’s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters the estimate of the cost of resolving the nonpcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning’s financial statements is remote 

other possible liabilities 

sfas 5 and other similarly focused accounting literature require us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters including certain tax planning and environmental matters these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 

pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb 

pension and opeb costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates benefits earned interest cost expected return on plan assets mortality rates and other factors in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 

as of december 31 2008 the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was 2342 million 

  

the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans 

 

 the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning’s funding requirements 

in addition at december 31 2008 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders’ equity by 82 million before tax a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders’ equity by 81 million in addition the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to corning’s us opeb plans 

 

 the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned in certain instances revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns allowances discounts and other factors these estimates are supported by historical data while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning’s future results 

stock compensation 

stock based compensation expense and disclosures are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts these assumptions include riskfree discount rates expected term of the stock based compensation instrument granted volatility of stock and option prices expected time between grant date and date of exercise attrition performance and other factors these assumptions require us to exercise judgment our estimates of these assumptions typically are based upon our historical experience currently available market place data and forward looking explanatory variables while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s future stock based compensation expense and disclosures

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects 

 

  we have foreign currency exposure to the japanese yen the new taiwan dollar the korean won and the euro we selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 18 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases these hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or corning enter into lending situations generally on an intercompany basis denominated in currencies other than their local currency we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes corning uses derivative instruments forwards to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and as such are referred to as undesignated hedges changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities are recorded in current period earnings in other expense income net in the consolidated statements of income 

equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations equity in earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments was 13 billion in 2008 and 942 million in 2007 with foreignbased affiliates comprising over 72 of this amount in 2008 equity earnings from samsung corning and samsung corning precision totaled 911 million for 2008 and 532 million for 2007 exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies 

we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2008 we had open forward contracts and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements all of which were designated as hedges at december 31 2008 a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 215 million compared to 239 million at december 31 2007 specific to the japanese yen a 10 adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 118 million compared to 146 million at december 31 2007 

as we derive approximately 74 of our net sales from outside the us our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies most notably the japanese yen and euro our forecasts generally assume exchange rates during 2009 remain constant at january 2009 levels a plus or minus 10 point movement in the us dollar  japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2009 net sales of approximately 183 million and net income of approximately 215 million a plus or minus 10 point movement in the us dollar  euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2009 net sales of approximately 26 million and net income of approximately 4 million 

interest rate risk management 

it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2008 our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than 1 of variable rate instruments

competition 

corning competes across all of its product lines with many large and varied manufacturers both domestic and foreign some of these competitors are larger than corning and some have broader product lines corning strives to maintain its position through technology and product innovation for the future corning believes its competitive advantage lies in its commitment to research and development and its commitment to quality there is no assurance that corning will be able to maintain its market position or competitive advantage 

display technologies segment 

corning including samsung corning precision is the largest worldwide producer of glass substrates for active matrix lcd displays that market position remained relatively stable over the past year corning believes it has competitive advantages in lcd glass substrate products from investing in new technologies providing a consistent and reliable supply and using its proprietary fusion manufacturing process this process allows us to deliver glass that is larger thinner and lighter with exceptional surface quality and without heavy metals asahi glass nippon electric glass and nh techno are corning’s principal competitors in display glass substrates 

telecommunications segment 

competition within the telecommunications equipment industry is intense among several significant companies corning is a leading competitor in the segment’s principal product lines which include optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment price and new product innovations are significant competitive factors the competitive landscape has experienced increasing competition causing price pressure in all regions these competitive conditions are likely to persist 

corning is the largest producer of optical fiber and cable products but faces significant competition due to continued excess capacity in the market place price pressure and new product innovations corning believes its large scale manufacturing experience fiber process technology leadership and intellectual property assets yield cost advantages relative to several of its competitors the primary competing producers of optical fiber and cable products are furukawa electricofs fujikura ltd sumitomo electric prysmian cables  systems and draka comteq 

for hardware and equipment products significant competitors are 3m company 3m tyco electronics furukawa ofs commscope and adc communications 

environmental technologies segment 

for worldwide automotive ceramic substrate products corning has a leading market position that has remained relatively stable over the past year corning believes its competitive advantage in automotive ceramic substrate products for catalytic converters is based upon global presence customer service engineering design services and product innovation corning’s environmental technologies products face principal competition from ngk denso ibiden and emitec 

life sciences segment 

corning is a leading supplier of glass and plastic science laboratory products with a growing plastics products market presence in north america and europe and a solid laboratory glass products market presence corning seeks to maintain competitive advantages by emphasizing product quality product availability supply chain efficiency a wide product line and superior product attributes for laboratory products schott kimble greiner and becton dickinson are the principal worldwide competitors corning also faces increasing competition from large distributors that have backward integrated or introduced private label products 

other products 

corning is a leading supplier of materials and products for lithography optics in the semiconductor industry the market position for other products remained relatively stable during the past year corning seeks to compete by providing superior optical quality leading optical designs and a local corning presence supporting its customers for corning’s semiconductor optical material products general specialty glassglass ceramic products and ophthalmic products schott shinetsu quartz products asahi fine glass carl zeiss nikon transitions optical oerlikon hoya and heraeus are the main competitors 

samsung corning was a leading producer of cathode ray tube glass products for conventional televisions its relative competitive position remained stable over the past year although there has been a significant decline in the industry as endmarket customers have turned to flat panel displays or projection technologies on december 31 2007 samsung corning precision acquired all of the outstanding shares of samsung corning after the transaction corning retained its 50 interest in samsung corning precision 

  

raw materials 

corning’s production of specialty glasses ceramics and related materials requires significant quantities of energy uninterrupted power sources certain precious metals and various batch materials 

although energy shortages and power interruptions have not been a problem recently the cost of energy has increased corning has achieved flexibility through important engineering changes to take advantage of lowcost energy sources in most significant processes specifically many of corning’s principal manufacturing processes can be operated with natural gas propane oil or electricity or a combination of these energy sources 

as to resources ores minerals polymers and processed chemicals required in manufacturing operations availability appears to be adequate corning’s suppliers from time to time may experience capacity limitations in their own operations or may eliminate certain product lines nevertheless corning believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch materials and precious metals for many products corning has alternate glass compositions that would allow operations to continue without interruption in the event of specific materials shortages 

certain key materials and proprietary equipment used in the manufacturing of products are currently sole sourced or available only from a limited number of suppliers any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments or reduce corning’s gross margins 

patents and trademarks 

inventions by members of corning’s research and engineering staff have been and continue to be important to the company’s growth patents have been granted on many of these inventions in the united states and other countries some of these patents have been licensed to other manufacturers including companies in which corning has equity investments many of the earlier patents have now expired but corning continues to seek and obtain patents protecting its newer innovations in 2007 corning was granted over 180 patents in the us and over 350 patents in countries outside the us 

each business segment possesses its own patent portfolio that provides certain competitive advantages in protecting corning’s innovations corning has historically enforced and will continue to enforce its intellectual property rights at the end of 2007 corning and its wholly owned subsidiaries owned over 4300 unexpired patents in various countries of which about 2300 were us patents between 2008 and 2010 approximately 11 of these patents will expire while at the same time corning intends to seek patents protecting its newer innovations worldwide corning has over 4000 patent applications in process with about 1100 in process in the us corning believes that its patent portfolio will continue to provide a competitive advantage in protecting corning’s innovation although corning’s competitors in each of its businesses are actively seeking patent protection as well 

the display technologies segment has over 260 patents in various countries of which over 100 are us patents no one patent is considered material to this business segment some of the important issued us patents in this segment include patents relating to glass compositions and methods for the use and manufacture of glass substrates for display applications there is no group of important display technology segment patents set to expire between 2008 and 2010 

the telecommunications segment has over 1600 patents in various countries of which over 800 are us patents no one patent is considered material to this business segment some of the important issued us patents in this segment include i patents relating to optical fiber products including dispersion compensating fiber low loss optical fiber and high data rate optical fiber and processes and equipment for manufacturing optical fiber including methods for making optical fiber preforms and methods for drawing cooling and winding optical fiber ii patents relating to optical fiber ribbons and methods for making such ribbon fiber optic cable designs and methods for installing optical fiber cable and iii patents relating to optical fiber and electrical connectors and associated methods of manufacture a few patents relating to optical fiber connectors and a few relating to optical fiber manufacturing will expire between 2008 and 2010 

the environmental technologies segment has over 400 patents in various countries of which over 200 are us patents no one patent is considered material to this business segment some of the important issued us patents in this segment include patents relating to cellular ceramic honeycomb products together with ceramic batch and binder system compositions honeycomb extrusion and firing processes and honeycomb extrusion dies and equipment for the highvolume lowcost manufacture of such products there is no group of important environmental technologies segment patents set to expire between 2008 and 2010

many of these patents are used in corning’s operations or are licensed for use by others and corning is licensed to use patents owned by others corning has entered into cross licensing arrangements with some major competitors but the scope of such licenses has been limited to specific product areas or technologies 

corning’s principal trademarks include the following corning celcor duratrap eagle2000 eaglexg epic evolant hpfs lanscape pyrex clearcurve smf28e jade vita and steuben 

protection of the environment 

corning has a program to ensure that its facilities are in compliance with state federal and foreign pollutioncontrol regulations this program has resulted in capital and operating expenditures during the past several years in order to maintain compliance with such regulations capital expenditures for pollution control in continuing operations were approximately 21 million in 2007 and are estimated to be 19 million in 2008 

corning’s 2007 operating results from continuing operations were charged with approximately 51 million for depreciation maintenance waste disposal and other operating expenses associated with pollution control corning believes that its compliance program will not place it at a competitive disadvantage 

employees 

at december 31 2007 corning had approximately 24800 fulltime employees including approximately 10400 employees in the united states from time to time corning also retains consultants independent contractors and temporary and parttime workers unions are certified as bargaining agents for approximately 30 of corning’s united states employees

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report or otherwise have a detrimental affect on the company these risks should be considered in making any investment decisions in corning future results could be materially affected by general industry and market conditions changes in laws or accounting rules general economic and political conditions including a global economic slowdown fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates terrorism political unrest or international conflicts political instability or major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this annual report additional risks not described above or unknown to us may also adversely affect corning or its results 

our sales could be negatively impacted if one or more of our key customers substantially reduce orders for our products 

corning’s ten largest customers account for about 50 of our sales no individual customer accounts for more than 10 of consolidated sales except for au optronics corporation auo which accounted for 12 of consolidated sales in 2007 

in addition a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in each of our reportable operating segments for 2007 three customers of the display technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales represented 62 of total segment sales when combined in the telecommunications segment two customers which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales represented 25 of total segment sales when combined in the environmental technologies segment three customers which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales represented 81 of total segment sales in aggregate in the life sciences segment one distributor accounted for 44 of this segment’s sales in 2007 

samsung corning precision’s sales were also concentrated in 2007 with sales to two lcd panel makers located in south korea accounting for approximately 93 of total samsung corning precision sales 

although the sale of lcd glass substrates has increased in 2007 there can be no assurance that positive trends will continue our customers are lcd panel and color filter makers as they switch to larger size glass the pace of their orders may be uneven while they adjust their manufacturing processes and facilities additionally consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes price or other seasonal factors may lead to pauses in market growth from time to time our customers may not be able to maintain profitable operations or access sufficient capital to fund ongoing and future planned expansions which may limit their pace of orders to us emerging material technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications resulting in a decline in demand for our lcd products technologies for displays in competition with lcd panels may reduce or eliminate the need for our glass substrate these technologies may include organic light emitting diodes and plasma display panels new process technologies developed by our competitors may also place us at a cost or quality disadvantage in the workplace our inability to manufacture glass substrates in the sizes and quantities needed by our customers may result in loss of revenue margins and profits or liabilities for failure to supply a scarcity of resources limitations on technology personnel or other factors resulting in a failure to produce commercial quantities of very large size glass substrates particularly from new facilities being constructed at a major customer in japan could have adverse financial consequences to us 

our telecommunications segment customers’ purchases of our products are affected by their capital expansion plans general market and economic uncertainty and regulatory changes including broadband policy sales in the telecommunications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of verizon communication inc verizon fibertothepremises deployments our sales will be dependent on verizon’s planned targets for homes passed and connected changes in verizon’s deployment plan could adversely affect future sales in any quarter or for the full year 

  

in the environmental technologies segment sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for automotive and diesel emissions and pollution control are expected to fluctuate with vehicle production changes in governmental laws and regulations for air quality and emission controls may also influence future sales sales in our environmental technologies segment are to four catalyzers and emission system component manufacturers our customers sell these systems to automotive original equipment manufacturers and diesel engine manufacturers sales within this segment may be affected by adverse developments in the us vehicle or freight hauling industries or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicle sales or downturns in freight traffic 

sales in our life sciences segment were historically through two large distributors to government entities pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies hospitals universities and other research facilities during 2005 we did not renew the contract with one large distributor and transitioned the sales through this distributor to our remaining primary distributor and other existing and developing channels this change had an adverse impact on sales volumes in 2007 our remaining primary distributor accounted for 44 of life sciences segment sales changes in our distribution arrangements in this segment may adversely affect this segment’s financial results 

if the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate demand for our products may decline which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial performance 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies evolving industry or government standards and new product introductions our success is expected to depend in substantial part on the successful introduction of new products or upgrades of current products and our ability to compete with new technologies the following factors related to our products and markets if not achieved could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

 

       we face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance 

we face pricing pressure in each of our leading businesses as a result of intense competition emerging new technologies or overcapacity while we will work toward reducing our costs to offset pricing pressures we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or to sustain our current rate of cost reduction we anticipate pricing pressures will continue into 2008 and beyond on a number of our products although we have reduced the rate of price decline in 2007 in our display technologies segment and plan to continue to do so in 2008 we cannot be assured of success our 2008 pricing strategy in our display technologies segment may also result in lost market share and lower volumes 

  

we face risks related to our international operations and sales 

we have customers and significant operations including manufacturing and sales located outside the us we have large manufacturing operations for liquid crystal display glass substrates in taiwan and the asiapacific region including an equity investment in samsung corning precision operating in south korea that makes glass substrates for the lcd market all of our display segment customers are located in the asiapacific region as a result of these and other international operations we face a number of risks including 

 

          any of these items could cause our sales or profitability to be significantly reduced 

additionally because a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our display technologies segment is concentrated in asia it is at least reasonably possible that the use of a facility located outside of an entity’s home country could be disrupted due to the specialized nature of the assets it would not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly accordingly loss of these facilities could produce a nearterm severe impact to our display business and the company as a whole 

we face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations 

because we have significant customers and operations outside the us fluctuations in foreign currencies especially the japanese yen the new taiwan dollar the korean won and the euro affect our sales and profit levels foreign exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the dollar and japanese yen sales in our display technologies segment representing 45 of corning’s sales in 2007 are denominated in japanese yen the expected sales growth of the display technologies segment will increase our exposure to currency fluctuations corning hedges significant transaction and balance sheet currency exposures and uses derivatives instruments to limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities as well as operating results although we hedge these items changes in exchange rates especially the japanese yen to us dollar may significantly impact our reported revenues and results of operations 

if the financial condition of our customers declines our credit risks could increase 

although we have a rigorous process to administer credit and believe our reserve is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable if our customers fail to meet their payment obligations to us we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amounts reserved some customers of our display technologies segment are thinly capitalized andor marginally profitable in our environmental products segment the us auto customers and certain of their suppliers have encountered credit downgrades these factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business as of december 31 2007 reserves and allowances for trade receivables totaled approximately 20 million 

if we do not successfully adjust our manufacturing volumes and fixed cost structure or achieve manufacturing yields or sufficient product reliability our operating results could suffer and we may not achieve anticipated profitability levels 

we are investing heavily in additional manufacturing capacity of certain businesses including liquid crystal display glass and diesel emission substrates and filters the speed of constructing the new facilities presents challenges we may face technical and process issues in moving to commercial production there can be no assurance that corning will be able to pace its capacity expansion to the actual demand it is possible that manufacturing capacity may exceed or lag customer demand during certain periods 

the manufacturing of our products involves highly complex and precise processes requiring production in highly controlled and dustfree environments changes in our manufacturing processes could significantly reduce our manufacturing yields and product reliability in some cases existing manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the requirements of our customers we will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to achieve targeted volume pricing and cost levels that will permit profitable operations while we continue to fund projects to improve our manufacturing techniques and processes we may not achieve satisfactory cost levels in our manufacturing activities that will fully satisfy our profitability targets 

  

our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials parts and manufacturing equipment components to meet the demands of our customers 

our ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials parts and components from our suppliers we may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages there can be no assurances that we will not encounter these problems in the future furthermore certain manufacturing equipment raw materials or components are available only from a single source or limited sources we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner a reduction interruption or delay of supply or a significant increase in the price for supplies such as manufacturing equipment raw materials or energy could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

we have incurred and may in the future incur restructuring and other charges the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately 

we have recorded several charges for restructuring impairment of assets and the writeoff of cost and equity based investments it is possible we may record additional charges for restructuring or other asset impairments if additional actions become necessary 

we have incurred and may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 

at december 31 2007 corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of 308 million while we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur 

if our products or materials purchased from our suppliers experience performance issues our business will suffer 

our business depends on the production of products of consistently high quality our products components and materials purchased from our suppliers are typically tested for quality these testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios for various reasons our products including materials purchased from our suppliers may fail to perform as expected in some cases product redesigns or additional expense may be required to correct a defect a significant or systemic product failure could result in customer relations problems lost sales and financial damages 

we face competition in most of our businesses 

we expect that we will face additional competition from existing competitors low cost manufacturers and new entrants we must invest in research and development expand our engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities and continue to improve customer service and support in order to remain competitive we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position 

accounting and disclosure rules may affect financial results 

generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations for many areas of our business such as revenue recognition accounting for investments and accounting for stock options are very complex and involve significant and sometimes subjective judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantly impact our reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures in the future without a corresponding change in our cash flows 

we rely on key personnel and the loss of their services or the inability to attract and retain them may negatively affect our businesses 

our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified research and development engineering and operating personnel generally and during periods of rapid growth especially in those of our businesses focused on new products and advanced manufacturing processes is essential to our business success we also depend on the services of experienced key senior management 

the loss of the services of any of our key research and development engineering or operational personnel or senior management without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

  

we are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations 

our manufacturing process generates chemical waste waste water and other industrial waste and various green house gases at various stages in the manufacturing process and we are currently or may be in the future subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of such substances we have installed various types of antipollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our various facilities however we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that the local or national governments will not take steps toward adopting more stringent environment standards 

any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us suspensioncessation of production or operations in addition environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the united states and other countries such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and co 2 abatement may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by among other things substantially increasing manufacturing costs limiting availability of scarce resources especially energy or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers 

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses we cannot assure you that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors changes in law concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to protect our intellectual property litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently uncertain and the outcome is often unpredictable other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios 

the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products we are and may in the future be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation that may result in loss of revenue require us to incur substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us we cannot assure you as to the outcome of any such claims 

current or future litigation may harm our financial condition or results of operations 

pending threatened or future litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes expenses and costs exceeding amounts estimated or insured in particular we have been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos as described in legal proceedings our negotiations with the representatives of asbestos claimants produced a tentative plan of settlement through a pcc plan of reorganization but this plan was not confirmed by the bankruptcy court the proponents of the plan have moved for reconsideration of the order entered by the court on december 21 2006 denying plan confirmation it is reasonably possible that changes to the plan will be negotiated but the elements of the plan and final approval are subject to a number of contingencies total charges of 1 billion have been recorded through december 31 2007 however additional charges or credits are possible due to the potential fluctuation in the price of our common stock other adjustments in the proposed settlement and other litigation factors 

we face risks through our equity method investments in companies that we do not control 

corning’s net income includes significant equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended december 31 2007 we recognized 942 million of equity earnings of which 927 million came from our two largest investments dow corning corporation which makes silicone products and samsung corning precision which makes liquid crystal display glass samsung corning precision is located in the asiapacific region and is subject to political and geographic risks mentioned above as well as business and other risks within the display segment our equity investments may not continue to perform at the same levels as in recent years in 2006 and 2007 we recognized equity losses associated with samsung corning co ltd our 50 equity method investment that makes glass panels and funnels for conventional televisions which recorded fixed asset and other impairment charges 

  

we may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us 

we face the risk of loss resulting from product liability securities fiduciary liability intellectual property antitrust contractual warranty environmental fraud and other lawsuits whether or not such claims are valid in addition our product liability fiduciary directors and officers property natural catastrophe and comprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect our insurance costs can be volatile and at any time can increase given changes in market supply and demand we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs a successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us to pay substantial sums some of the carriers in our excess insurance programs are in liquidation and may not be able to respond if we should have claims reaching into excess layers the financial health of other insurers may deteriorate several of our insurance carriers are litigating with us the extent if any of their obligation to provide insurance coverage for asbestosis liabilities asserted against us the results of that litigation may adversely affect our insurance coverage for those risks in addition we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain risk such as political risk terrorism or war

 item 3 legal proceedings 

environmental litigation corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party at 20 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by the agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants corning has accrued approximately 19 million undiscounted for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and litigation at december 31 2007 based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote

pittsburgh corning corporation corning and ppg industries inc ppg each own 50 of the capital stock of pittsburgh corning corporation pcc over a period of more than two decades pcc and several other defendants have been named in numerous lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos on april 16 2000 pcc filed for chapter 11 reorganization in the us bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania as a result of pcc’s bankruptcy filing corning recorded an aftertax charge of 36 million in 2001 to fully impair its investment in pcc and discontinued recognition of equity earnings at the time pcc filed for bankruptcy protection there were approximately 12400 claims pending against corning in state court lawsuits alleging various theories of liability based on exposure to pcc’s asbestos products and typically requesting monetary damages in excess of one million dollars per claim corning has defended those claims on the basis of the separate corporate status of pcc and the absence of any facts supporting claims of direct liability arising from pcc’s asbestos products corning is also currently named in approximately 10300 other cases approximately 41700 claims alleging injuries from asbestos and similar amounts of monetary damages per claim those cases have been subject to the preliminary injunction described below and prior to the injunction were covered by insurance without material impact to corning to date asbestos litigation is inherently difficult and past trends in resolving these claims may not be indicators of future outcomes 

in the bankruptcy court in april 2000 pcc obtained a preliminary injunction against the prosecution of asbestos actions arising from pcc’s products against its two shareholders to afford the parties a period of time in which to negotiate a plan of reorganization for pcc the pcc plan 

on may 14 2002 ppg announced that it had agreed with certain of its insurance carriers and representatives of current and future asbestos claimants on the terms of a settlement arrangement applicable to claims arising from pcc’s products 

on march 28 2003 corning announced that it had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and future asbestos claims against it and pcc which might arise from pcc products or operations the proposed settlement if the pcc plan is approved and becomes effective would require corning to relinquish its equity interest in pcc contribute its equity interest in pittsburgh corning europe nv pce a belgian corporation and contribute 25 million shares of corning common stock corning would also pay a total of 140 million in six annual installments present value 131 million at march 2003 beginning one year after the pcc plan becomes effective with 55 percent interest from june 2004 and assign certain insurance policy proceeds from its primary insurance and a portion of its excess insurance at the time of settlement 

the pcc plan received a favorable vote from creditors in march 2004 hearings to consider objections to the pcc plan were held in the bankruptcy court in may 2004 in february 2006 the bankruptcy court requested that the pcc plan proponents delete references to section 105a of the bankruptcy code and resubmit the pcc plan the final round of oral argument was held on july 21 2006 

on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court issued an order denying confirmation of the pcc plan for reasons set out in a memorandum opinion several parties including corning filed motions for reconsideration these motions were argued on march 5 2007 and the bankruptcy court reserved decision on january 10 2008 some of the parties in the proceeding advised the bankruptcy court that they had made substantial progress on an amended plan of reorganization that would make it unnecessary for the bankruptcy court to decide the motion for reconsideration if the bankruptcy court does not approve the pcc plan in its current form or parties to the proceedings agree to amend the pcc plan changes to the pcc plan are reasonably likely to occur that could significantly reduce the value corning would pay in such a changed plan 

  

the outcome of these proceedings is uncertain and confirmation of the current pcc plan or any amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies however apart from the quarterly marktomarket adjustment in the value of the components of the settlement management believes that the likelihood of a material adverse impact to corning’s financial statements is remote 

two of corning’s primary insurers and several excess insurers have commenced litigation for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies including rights that may be affected by the settlement arrangement described above corning is vigorously contesting these cases management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation 

since march 31 2003 we have recorded total net charges of 1 billion to reflect the agreed settlement contributions and subsequent adjustments for the change in the settlement value of the components 

the liability expected to be settled by contribution of our investment in pce assigned insurance proceeds and the 25 million shares of our common stock which totals 833 million at december 31 2007 is recorded in the other accrued liabilities component in our consolidated balance sheets this portion of the pcc liability is considered a “due on demand” obligation accordingly this portion of the obligation has been classified as a current liability even though it is possible that the contribution could be made beyond one year the remaining portion of the settlement liability which totals 169 million at december 31 2007 representing the net present value of the cash payments is recorded in the other liabilities component in our consolidated balance sheets

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our key priorities for 2007 remained unchanged from the previous three years protect our financial health improve our profitability and invest in the future we made significant progress on these in 2007 

financial health 

in 2007 our balance sheet remained strong and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities significant items in 2007 included the following 

 

     we ended 2007 with 35 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments this represents an increase of 349 million from december 31 2006 

our revolving credit facility amended in november 2006 provides committed access to a 11 billion unsecured multicurrency revolving line of credit through march 2011 we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations the asbestos settlement research and development capital expenditures scheduled debt repayments dividend payments and our stock repurchase program 

profitability 

for the year ended december 31 2007 we generated net income of 22 billion or 134 per share compared to net income of 19 billion or 116 per share for 2006 the improvement in net income was due largely to the following items 

 

   the increase in net income was offset by asbestos settlement expense of 185 million in 2007 compared to a credit of 2 million in 2006 reflecting the change in the settlement value of corning’s asbestos settlement liability the change in the settlement value of this liability was primarily attributable to the change in the value of 25 million shares of corning’s common stock to be contributed to the proposed settlement net income was also negatively impacted by restructuring impairment and other charges at samsung corning our share of these charges in 2007 was 40 million refer to note 7 investments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these items 

investing in our future 

we continue to focus on the future and on what we do best – creating and making keystone components that enable hightechnology systems we remain committed to investing in research development and engineering to drive innovation in 2007 approximately onethird of our total research development and engineering expenditures were for research this spending related to our existing businesses new business development exploratory research and early stage marketing we continue to work on technologies for glass substrates for active matrix lcds diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that will enable fibertothepremises we are also making increased investments in new technologies such as the epic™ system synthetic green lasers silicononglass and microreactors 

our research development and engineering expenditures increased by 48 million in 2007 when compared to 2006 but remained fairly constant as a percentage of net sales we believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies 

  

we also remain committed to investing in manufacturing capacity to match increased demand in our businesses our capital expenditures were primarily focused on expanding manufacturing capacity for lcd glass substrates in the display technologies segment and diesel products in the environmental technologies segment total capital expenditures for 2007 were 13 billion of which 883 million was directed toward our display technologies segment and 67 million was invested in our environmental technologies segment in addition in april 2007 we announced a 300 million facility improvement plan for the company’s sullivan park research and development campus near corning new york the expansion is expected to be completed over a sixyear period 

we expect our 2008 capital spending to be in the range of 15 billion to 17 billion of which approximately 800 million to 10 billion will be directed toward our display technologies segment in december 2007 we announced a 5year capital expenditure plan of 795 million to locate a glass manufacturing facility at sharp corporation’s plant in sakai city japan production from this new facility is expected to meet sharp corporation’s plan to begin production of lcd panels for large televisions by march 2010 in february 2008 we announced a 453 million expansion of our lcd manufacturing facility in taichung taiwan the range provided for 2008 for our display technologies segment includes some spending for recently announced projects 

results of operations 

selected highlights from our continuing operations follow dollars in millions 

 

 net sales 

the net sales increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily the result of increased volumes in the display technologies environmental technologies and telecommunications segments for those three segments sales volume increases were offset somewhat by price declines movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on 2007 net sales when compared with last year 

  

the net sales increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was the result of increased demand for lcd glass substrates in our display technologies segment and yearoveryear increased volume in the telecommunications segment net sales for all other segments were comparable to the prior year movements in foreign exchange rates negatively impacted 2006 net sales by approximately 125 million or 3 when compared with 2005 

reflecting the growth in our display technologies segment net sales into international markets continued to surpass those into the us market for 2007 sales into international markets accounted for 72 of net sales for 2006 and 2005 sales into international markets accounted for 71 of net sales 

cost of sales 

the types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are raw materials consumption including direct and indirect materials salaries wages and benefits depreciation and amortization production utilities productionrelated purchasing warehousing including receiving and inspection repairs and maintenance interlocation inventory transfer costs production and warehousing facility property insurance rent for production facilities and other production overhead 

gross margin 

for 2007 gross margin improved both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales when compared to 2006 improvements were driven primarily by strong sales volumes in the display technologies telecommunications and environmental technologies segments cost reduction efforts and manufacturing efficiencies in these segments also drove gross margin improvements in 2007 when compared to 2006 

as a percentage of net sales 2006 gross margin was up slightly from 2005 driven primarily by our display technologies segment gross margins for this segment were essentially even with 2005 reflecting the negative impact of price declines offset by higher volumes and cost reductions display technologies segment sales increased from 38 of total corning’s sales in 2005 to 41 of corning’s sales in 2006 as display technologies has a higher gross margin than our consolidated gross margin the added concentration in display technologies in 2006 caused corning’s gross margin percentage to increase from 43 in 2005 to 44 in 2006 

selling general and administrative expenses 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses for 2007 when compared to 2006 in dollars was largely due to an increase in compensationrelated expenses as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expense in 2007 declined slightly when compared to last year due to cost control efforts 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses for 2006 compared to 2005 in dollars was primarily due to an increase in stockbased compensation expense as a result of the company’s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment sfas 123r effective january 1 2006 as a percent of net sales selling general and administrative expenses in 2006 and 2005 were comparable 

the types of expenses included in the selling general and administrative expenses line item are salaries wages and benefits travel sales commissions professional fees and depreciation and amortization utilities and rent for administrative facilities 

sharebased compensation 

prior to january 1 2006 the company accounted for sharebased awards granted under the company’s stock compensation programs using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” apb 25 and sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas 123 under the intrinsic value method no sharebased compensation cost related to stock options had been recognized in the company’s consolidated statements of operations because the exercise price was at least equal to the market value of the common stock on the grant date as a result the recognition of sharebased compensation cost was generally limited to the expense attributed to restricted stock awards and stock option modifications as permitted under sfas 123 the company reported proforma disclosures presenting results and earnings per share as if we had used the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123 in the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

effective january 1 2006 the company adopted the provisions of sfas 123r using the modified prospective application method under the modified prospective application method compensation cost recognized in 2006 includes a compensation cost for all sharebased awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 1 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas 123 and b compensation cost for all sharebased awards granted subsequent to january 1 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r compensation cost is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award in accordance with the modified prospective application method results for prior periods have not been restated the adoption of sfas 123r resulted in a decrease of 005 in basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2006 see note 17 sharebased compensation to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the impact of sfas 123r 

research development and engineering expenses 

research development and engineering expenditures for 2007 and 2006 increased by 48 million and 74 million respectively when compared to the previous year but remained even as a percentage of net sales in 2007 approximately onethird of total research development and engineering expenditures were for research spending related to our existing businesses new business development exploratory research and early stage marketing expenditures for the past three years have been focused on our display technologies environmental technologies and telecommunications segments as we looked to capitalize on market opportunities in those segments expenses in each year also reflect costs associated with later stage development projects to support future growth these projects include investments in new technologies such as synthetic green lasers silicononglass and microreactors 

restructuring impairment and other charges and credits 

corning recorded restructuring impairment and other charges and credits in 2006 and 2005 which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented a description of those charges follows 

impairment of longlived assets other than goodwill 

2006 impairment charge for assets held for use 

in 2006 we recorded an asset held for use impairment charge of 44 million to impair certain longlived assets of our telecommunications segment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” sfas 144 due to our lowered longterm outlook for this business  we determined that an event of impairment as defined by sfas 144 had occurred in that business which further required us to test this asset group for impairment we assess recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we estimated the fair value of the longlived assets for this business using a discounted expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value as a result of our impairment evaluation we recorded an impairment charge to writedown the asset group to its estimated fair value 

other credits 

2005 reversal of currency translation adjustment 

in 2003 corning sold its photonic business operations to avanex the photonics business was the sole operation of corning oti srl oti a whollyowned italian subsidiary of corning whose results were included in corning’s telecommunications segment subsequent to the sale of the operating assets of oti to avanex corning began liquidating oti in october 2005 the assets of oti were determined to be substantially liquidated as a result of the substantial liquidation oti’s cumulative translation account was reversed resulting in a gain of 84 million in the fourth quarter 

impairment of available for sale securities 

2005 impairment charge 

in 2005 we recorded impairment charges of 25 million for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our investment in avanex corporation avanex below its adjusted cost basis our investment in avanex was accounted for as an availableforsale security under sfas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” sfas 115 in the fourth quarter of 2005 we completed the sale of our shares of avanex 

  

restructuring actions 

2005 restructuring actions 

corning recorded net restructuring charges of 15 million in 2005 which included the following 

 

  legal settlement  asbestos 

on march 28 2003 corning announced that it had reached agreement the pcc plan with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and future asbestos claims against it and pittsburgh corning corporation pcc which might arise from pcc products or operations the proposed settlement if the pcc plan is approved and becomes effective will require corning to relinquish its equity interest in pcc contribute its equity interest in pittsburgh corning europe nv pce a belgian corporation and contribute 25 million shares of corning common stock corning also agreed to pay a total of 140 million in six annual installments present value 131 million at march 2003 beginning one year after the pcc plan becomes effective with 55 percent interest from june 2004 and to assign certain insurance policy proceeds from its primary insurance and a portion of its excess insurance at the time of settlement 

the pcc plan received a favorable vote from creditors in march 2004 hearings to consider objections to the pcc plan were held in the bankruptcy court in may 2004 in february 2006 the bankruptcy court requested that the pcc plan proponents delete references to section 105a of the bankruptcy code and resubmit the pcc plan the final round of oral argument was held on july 21 2006 

on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court issued an order denying confirmation of the pcc plan for reasons set out in a memorandum opinion several parties including corning filed motions for reconsideration these motions were argued on march 5 2007 and the bankruptcy court reserved decision on january 10 2008 some of the parties in the proceeding advised the bankruptcy court that they had made substantial progress on an amended plan of reorganization that would make it unnecessary for the bankruptcy court to decide the motion for reconsideration if the bankruptcy court does not approve the pcc plan in its current form or parties to the proceeding agree to amend the pcc plan changes to the pcc plan are reasonably likely to occur that could significantly reduce the value corning would pay in such a changed plan 

the outcome of these proceedings is uncertain and confirmation of the current pcc plan or any amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies however apart from the quarterly marktomarket adjustment in the value of the components of the settlement management believes that the likelihood of a material adverse impact to corning’s financial statements is remote 

two of corning’s primary insurers and several excess insurers have commenced litigation for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies including rights that may be affected by the settlement arrangement described above corning is vigorously contesting these cases management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation 

since march 28 2003 we have recorded total net charges of 10 billion to reflect the initial settlement liability and subsequent adjustments for the change in the settlement value of the components of the liability 

the following summarizes the charges and credits we have recorded for the proposed asbestos settlement in millions 

 

 if the book value of the assets to be contributed in the asbestos settlement remains lower than the carrying value of the settlement liability a gain would be recognized at the time of settlement 

  

the liability expected to be settled by contribution of our investment in pce assigned insurance proceeds and the 25 million shares of our common stock which totals 833 million at december 31 2007 is recorded in the other accrued liabilities component in our consolidated balance sheets this portion of the pcc liability is considered a “due on demand” obligation accordingly this portion of the obligation has been classified as a current liability even though it is possible that the contribution could be made beyond one year the remaining portion of the settlement liability which totals 169 million at december 31 2007 representing the net present value of the cash payments is recorded in the other liabilities component in our consolidated balance sheets 

see legal proceedings for additional information about this matter 

other income net 

for 2007 and 2006 other income net increased by 78 million and 54 million respectively when compared to the previous year the increase in both periods reflected an increase in royalty income from samsung corning precision corning licenses certain of its patents and knowhow to samsung corning precision as well as to third parties which generate royalty income refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income before income taxes 

in addition to the items identified under gross margin restructuring impairment and other charges and credits and asbestos settlement the items below had an impact on income before income taxes as follows 

 

 provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows in millions 

 

 the effective income tax rates for 2007 and 2006 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

   the effective income tax rate for 2005 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

   sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” sfas no 109 provides that deferred tax assets are to be reduced by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not a likelihood of greater than 50 percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

sfas no 109 further requires that in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets objective evidence eg actual historical information should be given greater weight than subjective evidence eg the outlook for future profitability 

in 2005 and 2004 we recorded valuation allowances against our entire us deferred tax assets as a result of significant losses in the us in recent years in doing so we recorded valuation allowances against our us deferred tax assets that existed at december 31 2003 as well as against additional us deferred tax assets generated in 2005 and 2004 due to losses in those years 

in both 2007 and 2006 we generated income from continuing operations in the us the tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of the valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of us income the impact of the release of valuation allowances and thus not recording tax expense on income generated in the us is a reduction in our effective tax rate of 142 for both 2007 and 2006 

  

we continue to provide a full valuation allowance against our entire us deferred tax assets as of december 31 2007 because we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate in the future sufficient levels of profitability in the us to realize some or all of the deferred tax assets us profits of approximately 83 billion dollars would be required to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of december 31 2007 of that amount 42 billion of us profits would be required over the next 19 years to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with federal net operating loss carry forwards our evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets is inherently subjective and is based on our analysis and weighting of all positive and negative evidence available to us this evaluation includes estimates and assumptions about a number of market execution and economic variables our judgment as of december 31 2007 has been formed based on these variables which include 

 

  

  

    additionally a change in our judgment regarding the sustainability of the level of these royalties in accordance with the principles of fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin 48 may also impact our forecasts of us profitability 

although we remain optimistic about our consolidated outlook for 2008 and beyond as of december 31 2007 we are sufficiently uncertain about our usbased results primarily due to the current economic uncertainty but also due to a number of market and execution risks in our operating segments particularly those pertaining to display technologies as noted above that we have concluded that the positive evidence supporting realization of our us deferred tax assets does not sufficiently outweigh the negative evidence that we may not realize our us deferred tax assets 

we will update our assessment of the realizability of our us deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis in 2008 taking into account yeartodate actual as well as forecasted us results if after considering the actual results and the potential impact of the economic uncertainties and business risks considered in our 2007 yearend assessment as well as our fin 48 assessment of the display technologies us royalties we conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be profitable in the us in 2008 and future years we will quantify the portion of our us deferred tax assets we believe to be realizable and reduce our valuation allowance accordingly until that time we will continue to adjust the valuation allowance to offset the current us income tax expense or benefit that would otherwise be recorded on income or losses in the us and therefore reflect no net us income tax expense 

in 2004 we recorded valuation allowances against our entire german and australian deferred tax assets due to losses in recent years in 2007 due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections for our overall german operations we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the german national deferred tax assets are realizable and that the related valuation allowance is no longer required in 2006 due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections in australia and at certain of our german operations we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of the german local and the entire australian deferred tax assets were realizable and that the related valuation allowances were no longer required the impact of the releases of the valuation allowances on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 124 and 87 for 2007 and 2006 respectively 

certain foreign subsidiaries in china south africa and taiwan are or were operating under tax holiday arrangements the nature and extent of such arrangements vary and the benefits of such arrangements phase out in years 2006 to 2011 according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 121 101 and 89 for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

in addition to the aforementioned benefit of tax holidays the effective income tax rate for 2005 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to increasing the valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 

  

in 2004 significant events occurred which required us to increase the valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets at that time we believed that it was more likely than not that we could realize the remaining net us deferred tax assets of approximately 525 million through a tax planning strategy involving the sale of our investment in dow corning a nonstrategic appreciated asset if we were faced with expiring net operating loss carryforwards 

during 2005 dow corning’s performance was much stronger than expected and dow corning resumed paying a dividend both of which are expected to continue in the future due to this improved performance we concluded that dow corning provides strong financial geographic and market balance to corning’s portfolio of businesses the profitability of which has become more concentrated due to the success of the display operating segment as a result we considered dow corning to be a strategic investment and could no longer assert that a potential tax planning strategy involving the sale of dow corning would be prudent as required by sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” sfas 109 therefore we no longer believed in the fourth quarter of 2005 that it was more likely than not that we would realize the remaining net deferred tax assets accordingly we increased our valuation allowance by 525 million to fully reserve our net us deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2005 which increased our effective tax rate by 94

equity in earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments 

the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments in millions 

 

 the 2007 and 2006 increases in equity earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments are primarily due to strong sales and earnings performance at samsung corning precision and at dow corning when compared to the previous years additional information about the change in equity earnings from samsung corning precision is explained in the discussion of the performance of the display technologies segment 

dow corning performance was driven by sales growth in their traditional silicone product lines and in polysilicones for the semiconductor and solar energy industries dow corning sales grew approximately 12 in 2007 approximately 80 of dow corning’s sales were in their traditional silicone product lines the remaining sales were from polysilicone products net income at dow corning and corning’s resulting equity earnings from dow corning increased 3 in 2007 when compared to 2006 reflecting the growth in net sales offset in part by the nonrepeat of a 33 million favorable irs settlement in 2006 described below 

sales at dow corning are expected to grow between 10 and 12 in 2008 when compared to 2007 driven by increasing worldwide demand for silicone products and polysilicone products growth in net income and thus in corning’s equity in earnings from dow corning is expected to be greater than 12 

in addition to the above equity in earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments included the following restructuring and impairment charges and other credits 

 

       

until december 31 2007 corning had a 50 interest in samsung corning samsung electronics company ltd and affiliates owned the remaining 50 interest in samsung corning on december 31 2007 samsung corning precision acquired all of the outstanding shares of samsung corning after the transaction corning retained its 50 interest in samsung corning precision 

net income 

as a result of the items discussed above net income and per share data was as follows in millions except per share amounts 

 

 operating segments 

our reportable operating segments include display technologies telecommunications environmental technologies and life sciences the environmental technologies reportable segment is an aggregation of our automotive and diesel operating segments as these two segments share similar economic characteristics products customer types production processes and distribution methods the following provides a brief description of the products and markets served by each reportable segment 

 

    all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “all other” 

we prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions we include the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segment’s net income we have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for standalone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements 

display technologies 

the following table provides net sales and other data for the display technologies segment dollars in millions 

 

 2007 vs 2006 

the net sales increase for 2007 reflected volume gains of 38 measured in square feet of glass sold offset somewhat by price declines of 11 when compared to 2006 volume gains were driven by increased lcd monitor demand continued demand for glass for notebook computers and lcd tv market growth lcd tv market growth has resulted from both an increase in market penetration and an increase in the demand for larger size lcd glass substrates generation 5 and above largesize glass substrates which carry a slightly higher selling price per square foot continued to account for a significant portion of total sales volumes and were approximately 85 and 82 of sales volumes for 2007 and 2006 respectively net sales of the display technologies segment are denominated in japanese yen and as a result are susceptible to movements in the us dollar – japanese yen exchange rate the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on this segment’s net sales was not material in 2007 when compared with last year 

  

when compared to 2006 income before equity earnings for 2007 was up significantly due to higher net sales lower manufacturing costs and an increase in royalty income from samsung corning precision corning licenses certain of its patents and knowhow to samsung corning precision as well as to third parties which generate royalty income refer to note 7 investments to the consolidated financial statements for more information about related party transactions 

equity earnings for 2007 increased by 5 when compared to 2006 due to volume gains of 39 at samsung corning precision offset by price declines of 15 and increased operating and royalty expenses the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on equity earnings was not material in 2007 when compared with 2006 

the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan and taiwan for 2007 auo chi mei optoelectronics corporation and sharp corporation which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for 62 of total segment sales when combined 

in addition samsung corning precision’s sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers in 2007 sales to two lcd panel makers located in korea samsung electronics co ltd and lg phillips lcd co ltd accounted for approximately 93 of total samsung corning precision sales 

corning continues to invest heavily to expand capacity to meet the demand for lcd glass substrates in 2007 and 2006 capital spending in this segment was 883 million and 829 million respectively we expect capital spending for 2008 to be in the range of 800 million to 10 billion in december 2007 we announced a 5year capital expenditure plan of 795 million to locate a glass manufacturing facility at sharp corporation’s plant in sakai city japan production from this new facility is expected to meet sharp corporation’s plan to begin production of lcd panels for large televisions by march 2010 in february 2008 we announced a 453 million expansion of our lcd manufacturing facility in taichung taiwan the range provided for 2008 segment capital spending includes some spending for recently announced projects 

2006 vs 2005 

the net sales increase for 2006 reflected overall lcd glass market growth during 2006 glass substrate volumes increased 52 compared with 2005 driven by the same factors described in 2007 sales of largesize glass substrates accounted for 69 of total sales volumes in 2005 the growth in volume was partially offset by declines in weighted average selling prices of approximately 16 movements in the us dollar – japanese yen exchange rate negatively impacted 2006 sales by approximately 122 million or 7 when compared with 2005 

in the second quarter of 2006 the display technologies segment reported its first quarterly sequential decline in volume since the third quarter of 2001 the lower volume was the result of a number of our customers primarily in taiwan idling part of their facilities and thus reducing their demand for glass as a result of a buildup of panel inventory in the supply chain both volume and sales increased in the third quarter of 2006 when our customers reduced their inventories and began ramping up lcd panel production to meet seasonally stronger demand 

for 2006 the increase in income before equity earnings was primarily the result of higher volumes and manufacturing cost reductions offset somewhat by lower prices and the impact of exchange rates movements in currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2006 income before equity earnings by approximately 5 when compared with 2005 

the increase in our 2006 equity earnings primarily from samsung corning precision was largely driven by the same market factors identified for our wholly owned business in 2006 samsung corning precision’s earnings were negatively impacted by approximately 8 from movements in exchange rates compared to 2005 equity earnings from samsung corning precision are susceptible to movements in the us dollar–japanese yen and us dollar–korean won exchange rates 

in 2005 and 2004 corning and several customers entered into longterm purchase and supply agreements in which the display technologies segment agreed to supply largesize glass substrates to the customers over periods of up to six years as part of the agreements these customers agreed to make advance cash deposits to corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased in 2007 and 2006 corning received 105 million and 171 million respectively of customer deposits and issued 231 million and 126 million respectively in credit memoranda we do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements refer to note 10 other liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in the event customers elect not to purchase the agreed upon quantities of product subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits if corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements corning may be required to return certain amounts of the customer deposits 

  

outlook 

we expect to see a continuation of the overall industry growth and the trend toward large size substrates driven by increased end market demand for lcd televisions absent the impact of an economic slowdown we anticipate the volume growth in the lcd glass market to be between 25 and 30 in 2008 the expected market volume growth measured in square feet for the year should be equal to the volume growth in the market in 2007 corning’s lcd glass volume is expected to grow at the lower end of this range while samsung corning precision’s volume growth should be higher than the range growth rates by region for the industry generally and thus for corning’s wholly owned business and samsung corning precision may be different based on market dynamics 

we expect sales volume in the first quarter of 2008 to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2007 as lcd glass is in short supply we expect price declines in the first quarter of 2008 to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2007 

although end market demand for lcd televisions monitors and notebooks currently remains strong we are cautious about the potential negative impact that economic conditions particularly the slowing us economy and political tensions could have on consumer demand there is no assurance that the endmarket rates of growth will continue at the rates experienced in recent years that we will be able to pace our capacity expansions to actual demand or that the rate of cost declines will offset price declines in any given period while the industry has grown rapidly consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes prices or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth therefore it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time in addition changes in foreign exchange rates principally the japanese yen will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment 

telecommunications 

the following table provides net sales and other data for the telecommunications segment dollars in millions 

 

 2007 vs 2006 

segment net sales continue to be favorably impacted by growth in the telecommunications industry and in the private network market approximately 75 of segment net sales were sold into the public network market growth in the public network market was driven by favorable public policy especially in the us which fosters facilitiesbased competition and by strong financial health of service providers worldwide financially sound service providers have the ability to maintain or increase capital spending on network investments during the year there was a broadening of worldwide access construction projects such as fibertothepremises and fibertothenode approximately 54 of the world’s largest access service providers had some activity related to access construction which was up from 46 in 2006 the remaining 25 of this segment’s net sales were sold into the private network market demand in the private network market was driven in particular by growth in data centers growth in the public and private markets had a favorable impact on both optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment product sales in 2007 corning introduced the clearcurve ™ ultrabendable optical fiberbased suite of products that enable fiber deployments to multidwelling units we expect to begin shipments of clearcurve ™ products in early 2008 

effective april 30 2007 corning sold its european submarine cabling business and recorded a gain of 19 million on the sale effective april 1 2006 advance cable systems acs currently an equity company affiliate assumed responsibility for optical cable and hardware and equipment sales in japan as a result of these two transactions sales for 2007 are not comparable to sales for the same period last year 

  

telecommunications segment net sales excluding the impact of sales of submarine cabling products and sales of optical cable in japan increased 10 percent in 2007 this is a nongaap financial measure which management believes is useful to investors to understand the 2007 yearoveryear growth of this segment’s net sales the following is a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to the related gaap measure 

 

 in 2007 optical fiber market volume exceeded the previous market peak which occurred in 2001 confirming a recovery from the 2002 global telecommunications market downturn volume increases in 2007 were offset somewhat by price declines when compared to the previous year in addition 2007 net sales were positively impacted by 37 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates primarily the euro when compared to 2006 

net income in 2007 increased when compared to 2006 due to improvements in segment sales cost reductions the impact of the 19 million gain on the sale of the european submarine cabling business and the absence of an impairment charge which totaled 44 million in 2006 a favorable mix for optical fiber and cable products also contributed to improvements in segment net income in 2007 net income of this segment was positively impacted by 3 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared with 2006 

the telecommunications segment has a concentrated customer base in 2007 two customers of the telecommunications segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of total segment net sales accounted for 25 of total segment sales when combined 

2006 vs 2005 

increases in 2006 segment net sales were driven by improved sales in north america europe and china the increase was driven by a broader recovery in the telecommunications industry and growth in the private network market volume increases were offset somewhat by continued price declines when compared to 2005 movements in foreign exchange rates which can affect this segment’s net sales primarily the euro and japanese yen did not have a significant impact on sales in 2006 when compared to the previous year 

as noted above sales of this segment in 2006 were negatively impacted when acs assumed responsibility for optical cable and hardware and equipment sales in japan sales of optical cable and hardware and equipment in japan which are now recorded by an equity affiliate were 23 million in 2006 and 75 million in 2005 

for the telecommunications segment net income in 2006 and 2005 was impacted by restructuring impairment and other charges and credits in 2006 we recorded an aftertax impairment charge of 44 million in 2005 we recorded net aftertax credits of 47 million refer to results of operations for a discussion of these items the decline in net income for this segment in 2006 when compared to 2005 was primarily the result of the 2006 impairment charge described above and the absence of net aftertax credits of 47 million that were recorded in 2005 in 2006 movements in exchange rates did not significantly impact the results for this operating segment 

outlook 

for the telecommunications segment we expect sales and earnings to increase in 2008 reflecting continued strength in public and private network demand when compared to the last two years growth in the public network market is expected to benefit from increasing access construction activity private network growth is expected to result from data centers internet protocol networks and increased network speed which favors optical fiber products over copper we expect sales in the first quarter of 2008 to increase by approximately 5 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 sales will continue to be impacted by the seasonal buying patterns of our largest customer we expect manufacturing efficiencies will offset price declines changes in our customer’s expected deployment plan or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fibertothepremises products could also affect the sales level should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated our sales and earnings would be adversely affected 

  

environmental technologies 

the following table provides net sales and other data for the environmental technologies segment dollars in millions 

 

 2007 vs 2006 

sales of the environmental technologies segment in 2007 were higher when compared to 2006 due to increased sales from the diesel product lines and strong demand for automotive substrates diesel sales in 2007 reflected increased sales of heavy duty diesel products to meet the us emission regulations which went into effect on january 2 2007 sales of automotive products also improved when compared to last year due to an increase in sales to european and asian customers net sales of this segment were positively impacted by 23 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year 

net income of this segment was up when compared to last year due to higher sales manufacturing efficiencies and the impact of favorable movements in foreign exchange rates offset slightly by modest price declines improved utilization of our diesel manufacturing capacity also contributed to increased net income in this segment net income was positively impacted by 5 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year 

the environmental technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of manufacturers of catalyzers and emission control systems who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers the use of substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel engine manufacturers in 2007 three customers of the environmental technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for 81 of total segment sales 

2006 vs 2005 

sales of this segment in 2006 were somewhat higher than last year due to improvements in diesel products sales primarily for lightduty diesel vehicle applications however this increase was offset by a decline in automotive product sales due to lower volumes as end customers shift demand toward smaller more energy efficient vehicles demand for larger automobiles has declined this shift in demand has caused our automotive substrate volumes to decline because our market share is relatively higher for manufacturers of larger vehicles in addition volumes have been negatively impacted because smaller vehicles require proportionately smaller substrates movements in exchange rates did not have a significant impact on sales for this segment 

the decrease in net income in 2006 versus 2005 was due primarily to increased research development and engineering spending in preparation for the growth in sales of heavy duty and light duty diesel products 

outlook 

we expect both sales and earnings improvements in the environmental technologies segment in 2008 automotive substrate sales are expected to remain even with 2007 levels diesel products sales are expected to increase more than 25 in 2008 as regulations that require heavy duty diesel filters such as ours to meet tighter emission standards continue to drive sales improvements heavy duty diesel sales have been impacted by the weak freight market in the us the pace of recovery in that market will influence the rate of growth in sales of diesel products segment profitability is expected to increase due to higher diesel volumes and manufacturing cost reductions we expect sales in the first quarter to increase by approximately 5 when compared to the fourth quarter of last year changes in automotive and diesel vehicle production could adversely impact sales and net income of this segment 

  

life sciences 

the following table provides net sales and other data for the life sciences segment dollars in millions 

 

 2007 vs 2006 

net sales of the life sciences segment were up when compared to last year driven by market growth and higher prices government and private spending for drug development discovery and production continue to drive market growth in this segment movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of sales for the periods presented 

improved profitability of this segment in 2007 resulted from higher sales movements in foreign exchange rates manufacturing efficiencies and the absence of restructuring charges segment profitability in all years was impacted by development spending for new products movements in foreign exchange rates had a 4 million favorable impact on results of this segment for 2007 when compared with 2006 

in the life sciences segment one customer accounted for approximately 44 of this segment’s net sales in 2007 

2006 vs 2005 

net sales of the life sciences segment were up slightly in 2006 when compared to 2005 due to increased prices offset by volume declines in the us movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of sales 

the segment operated at a loss due to significant research development and engineering spending related to the epic ® system a highthroughput labelfree screening platform based on optical biosensor technology which had its market launch in 2006 the segment loss also includes 5 million of severance curtailment and asset impairment costs related to the shutdown of a facility in the united kingdom 

outlook 

sales for 2008 are expected to increase over 2007 driven by market growth price increases and sales of epic ® system products we expect sales in the first quarter of 2008 to be up slightly versus the fourth quarter of 2007 

all other 

the following table provides net sales and other data dollars in millions 

 

 all other includes all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting 

sales in this segment for 2007 were lower than 2006 due to a decline in sales of the specialty materials business sales in 2006 reflected stronger sales of the specialty materials business when compared to 2005 net income for each period presented reflected the impact of impairment and other charges and credits recorded by samsung corning co ltd in 2007 2006 and 2005 corning’s share of these items was a charge of 40 million a credit of 2 million and a charge of 106 million respectively refer to note 7 investments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

financing and capital structure 

the following items were significant to corning’s financing and capital structure during 2007 

 

     refer to note 11 debt to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

in november 2006 we amended our revolving credit facility so that it now provides us access to a 11 billion unsecured multicurrency revolving line of credit through march 2011 the facility includes two financial covenants a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio at december 31 2007 we were in compliance with both financial covenants 

capital spending 

capital spending totaled 13 billion 12 billion and 16 billion in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively capital spending activity in all three years primarily included expansion of lcd glass capacity in the display technologies segment and new capacity for diesel products in the environmental technologies segment our 2008 capital spending program is expected to be in the range of 15 billion to 17 billion with approximately 800 million to 10 billion used to expand manufacturing capacity for lcd glass substrates in the display technologies segment additionally approximately 200 million will be directed toward our environmental technologies segment to support the emerging diesel emissions control products and approximately 70 million will be spent on the expansion of the company’s sullivan park research and development campus 

shortterm investments 

included in our 13 billion shortterm investments at december 31 2007 were 301 million of assetbacked securities assetbacked securities are collateralized by credit card loans auto loans mortgages and student loans at december 31 2007 our exposure to subprime mortgages was 17 million unrealized losses on securities backed by subprime mortgages which are rated as investment grade were approximately 1 million at december 31 2007 and are expected to recover in the shortterm realized losses on these items amounted to 6 million in 2007 

defined benefit pension plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees our funding policy has been to contribute as necessary an amount in excess of the minimum requirements in order to achieve the company’s longterm funding targets in 2007 we made voluntary cash contributions of 131 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and 18 million to our international pension plans in 2006 we made an incremental cash contribution of 15 million to our domestic and international pension plans 

customer deposits 

certain customers of our display technologies segment have entered into longterm supply agreements and agreed to make advance cash deposits to secure supply of largesize glass substrates the deposits will be reduced through future product purchases thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods 

customer deposits have been received in the following periods in millions 

 

 we do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements 

  

in 2007 and 2006 we issued 231 million and 126 million respectively in credit memoranda these credit amounts are not included in the above amounts and were applied against customer receivables customer deposit liabilities were 531 million and 633 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively in 2008 we expect to issue approximately 190 million in credit memoranda 

restructuring 

during 2007 2006 and 2005 we made payments of 39 million 15 million and 25 million respectively related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions cash payments for employeerelated costs will be substantially completed by the end of 2008 while payments for exit activities will be substantially completed by the end of 2010 

key balance sheet data 

at december 31 2007 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 35 billion compared with 32 billion at december 31 2006 the increase from december 31 2006 was primarily due to an increase in operating cash flows 

balance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table dollars in millions 

 

  

 credit ratings 

as of february 15 2008 our credit ratings were as follows 

 

 management assessment of liquidity 

our major source of funding for 2008 and beyond will be our operating cash flow and our existing balances of cash cash equivalents and short term investments from time to time we may issue debt securities to refinance debt securities maturing in the next few years we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations the asbestos settlement research and development capital expenditures scheduled debt repayments dividend payments and our stock repurchase program 

  

off balance sheet arrangements 

off balance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 

corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include the following 

 

  fin 45 requires a company at the time a guarantee is issued to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant 

refer to note 13 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

corning leases certain transportation equipment from three trusts that qualify as variable interest entities under fasb interpretation 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51” fin 46r the sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to corning 

for variable interest entities we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by fin 46r the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of its expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests which are the ownership contractual or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests 

corning is the primary beneficiary of one of the three entities and as required by fin 46r the financial statements of the entity are included in corning’s consolidated financial statements corning is not the primary beneficiary of two of the three variable interest entities and as such fin 46r does not require corning to include them in it’s consolidated financial statements 

refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

corning does not have retained interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit liquidity or market risk support to that entity 

in 2005 and prior to adopting sfas 123r corning had employee compensation awards stock options that were excluded from the balance sheet sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas 133 requires all derivative instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value paragraph 11a of sfas 133 provides an exception to this requirement for contracts that are indexed to an entity’s own stock and classified in the shareholders’ equity section of the consolidated financial statements therefore prior to adopting sfas 123r employee stock option awards were excluded from the balance sheet because they met the paragraph 11a criteria in 2007 and 2006 those options were recorded in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet in 2005 and in the first quarter of 2006 we had other nonemployee contracts that did not meet the criteria in paragraph 11a those contracts were considered derivative instruments and were accounted for as such in the respective reporting periods

      we have provided financial guarantees and contingent liabilities in the form of standby letters of credit and performance bonds some of which do not have fixed or scheduled expiration dates we have agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow corning discussed in note 7 investments and note 13 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements the funding of the dow corning credit facility will be required only if dow corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed bankruptcy plan we believe the significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 

pensions 

we have a number of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees our largest single pension plan is corning’s us qualified plan at december 31 2007 this plan accounted for 80 of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation and 90 of the related plans’ assets 

at december 31 2006 corning adopted sfas 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plansan amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” sfas 158 sfas 158 requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in other comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur the impact of adopting sfas 158 resulted in a reduction to stockholders’ equity of 669 million after tax dow corning’s adoption of this standard resulted in a reduction to our investment in dow corning and a decrease to stockholders’ equity of 94 million after tax 

refer to note 12 employee retirement plans to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we have traditionally contributed to the us qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the irs minimum requirements and as a result mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until at least 2009 for 2007 we made voluntary cash contributions of 149 million to our domestic and international pension plans for 2006 we made an incremental contribution of 15 million to our domestic and international pension plans we anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of approximately 50 million to our domestic and international pension plans in 2008 

  

environment 

we have been named by the environmental protection agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 20 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by such agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is our policy to accrue for the estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by us based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2007 and 2006 we had accrued approximately 19 million undiscounted and 16 million undiscounted respectively for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date we believe that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates that required us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments follow 

impairment of assets held for use 

sfas 144 requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets when an event of impairment has occurred we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in certain circumstances we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

once it has been determined that an impairment has occurred an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the impaired assets to be held and used this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and terminal values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 

restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions 

sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” requires us to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including for example employee termination costs restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses of portions thereof their profitability cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome the judgment involved can be difficult subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses 

restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which as a result require impairment in accordance with sfas 144 sfas 144 requires us to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned 

valuation allowances for deferred income taxes 

sfas 109 “accounting for income taxes” sfas 109 requires us to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environments in which we do business it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances if we sustain an appropriate level of profitability primarily in the us or if we are able to develop tax planning strategies adjustments to current allowances will be required and may affect future net income refer to note 6 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

probability of litigation outcomes 

sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” sfas 5 requires us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter case law and other casespecific issues see legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face the most significant matter involving judgment is the pcc asbestos liability there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability including the inherent complexity of a chapter 11 filing our history of success in defending asbestos claims our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants’ representatives we have reached a tentative plan of settlement on pcc as disclosed in legal proceedings and note 7 investments to the consolidated financial statements the settlement is subject to a number of contingencies including approval by the bankruptcy court and resolution of any appeals on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court denied confirmation of the pcc plan of reorganization due to the scope of the channeling injunction proposed of the two shareholders with respect to other asbestos claims not deriving directly from pcc’s products or operations several parties including corning have moved for reconsideration of the ruling we continue to exercise judgment in assessing the likelihood that reconsideration will lead to a revised ruling or that an alternative plan of reorganization will emerge to address the claims deriving from pcc it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 

other possible liabilities 

sfas 5 and other similarly focused accounting literature require us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters including certain tax planning matters and environmental matters these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 

pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb 

pension and opeb costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates benefits earned interest cost expected return on plan assets mortality rates and other factors in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 

as of december 31 2007 the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was 2246 million 

the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans 

 

 the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning’s funding requirements 

in addition at december 31 2007 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders’ equity by 79 million before tax a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders’ equity by 81 million in addition the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate 

  

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to corning’s us opeb plans 

 

 the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

revenue recognition 

in certain instances revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns allowances discounts and other factors these estimates are supported by historical data while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning’s future results 

stock compensation 

stock based compensation expense and disclosures are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts these assumptions include riskfree discount rates expected term of the stock based compensation instrument granted volatility of stock and option prices expected time between grant date and date of exercise attrition performance and other factors these assumptions require us to exercise judgment our estimates of these assumptions typically are based upon our historical experience and currently available market place data while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s future stock based compensation expense and disclosures

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates our exposure to exchange rates have the following effects 

 

  our most significant foreign currency exposure is the japanese yen and to a much lesser extent the korean won the taiwan dollar and the euro we selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 18 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases these hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or corning enter into lending situations generally on an intercompany basis denominated in currencies other than their local currency we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes corning uses derivative instruments forwards to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and as such are referred to as undesignated hedges changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities are recorded in current period earnings in the other income net component in the consolidated statement of operations 

equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations equity in earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments was 942 million in 2007 and 960 million in 2006 with foreignbased affiliates comprising over 63 of this amount in 2007 equity earnings from samsung corning and samsung corning precision totaled 532 million for 2007 and 555 million for 2006 exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies 

we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2007 we had open forward contracts and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements all of which were designated as hedges at december 31 2007 a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 239 million specific to the japanese yen a 10 adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 146 million 

as we derive approximately 70 of our net sales from outside the us our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies most notably the japanese yen and euro our outlooks included in management’s discussion and analysis assume exchange rates during 2008 remain constant at january 2008 levels a plus or minus 10 point movement in the us dollar  japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2008 net sales of approximately 239 million and net income of approximately 220 million a plus or minus 10 point movement in the us dollar  euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2008 net sales of approximately 61 million and net income of approximately 12 million 

interest rate risk management 

it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2007 our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than 34 of variable rate instruments

 item 1 business 

general 

corning traces its origins to a glass business established in 1851 the present corporation was incorporated in the state of new york in december 1936 the company’s name was changed from corning glass works to corning incorporated on april 28 1989 

corning is a global technologybased corporation that operates in four reportable business segments display technologies telecommunications environmental technologies and life sciences 

display technologies segment 

corning’s display technologies segment manufactures glass substrates for active matrix liquid crystal displays lcds that are used primarily in notebook computers flat panel desktop monitors and lcd televisions corning’s facilities in kentucky japan and taiwan and those of samsung corning precision glass co ltd samsung corning precision which is 50 owned by corning in south korea develop manufacture and supply high quality glass substrates using a proprietary fusion manufacturing process and technology expertise samsung electronics co ltd has a 43 interest in samsung corning precision which sells glass to lcd panel manufacturers in korea another shareholder owns the remaining 7 interest in samsung corning precision panel manufacturers in the other leading lcdproducing areas of the world japan taiwan singapore and china are supplied by corning 

corning has been a leader to market with new largegeneration sized glass substrates used by our customers in the production of larger lcds for monitors and television we are recognized for providing product innovations that help our customers produce larger lighter thinner and higherresolution displays more affordably glass substrates are currently available from corning in sizes up to generation 8 2160mm x 2460mm which was introduced by corning in late 2006 large substrates generation 5 and higher allow lcd manufacturers to produce larger and a greater number of panels from each substrate the larger size leads to economies of scale for lcd manufacturers and is expected to enable lower display prices for consumers in the future at the end of 2006 approximately 85 of corning and samsung corning precision’s volume of lcd glass was generation 5 1100mm x 1250mm and higher 

corning’s proprietary fusion manufacturing process was invented by the company it is the cornerstone of corning’s technology leadership in the lcd industry the automated process yields high quality glass substrates with excellent dimensional stability and uniformity – essential attributes for the production of increasingly larger high performance active matrix lcds corning’s fusion process is scalable and has proven to be among the most effective processes in producing large size substrates in 2006 corning launched eagle xg™ the industry’s first environmentallyfriendly lcd glass substrate that is free of all heavy metals

additional information about corporate investments is presented in note 8 investments to the consolidated financial statements 

competition 

corning competes across all of its product lines with many large and varied manufacturers both domestic and foreign some of these competitors are larger than corning and some have broader product lines corning strives to maintain its position through technology and product innovation for the future corning believes its competitive advantage lies in its commitment to research and development and its commitment to quality there is no assurance that corning will be able to maintain its market position or competitive advantage 

display technologies segment 

corning is the largest worldwide producer of glass substrates for active matrix lcd displays that market position remained relatively stable over the past year corning believes it has competitive advantages in lcd glass substrate products from investing in new technologies offering a consistent source of reliable supply and using its proprietary fusion manufacturing process this process allows us to deliver glass that is larger thinner and lighter with exceptional surface quality asahi glass nippon electric glass and nh techno are corning’s principal competitors in display glass substrates in addition new entrants are seeking to expand their presence in this business 

telecommunications segment 

competition within the telecommunications equipment industry is intense among several significant companies corning is a leading competitor in the segment’s principal product lines which include optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment price and new product innovations are significant competitive factors the competitive landscape has experienced increasing competition causing price pressure in all regions these competitive conditions are likely to persist 

corning is the largest producer of optical fiber and cable products but faces significant competition due to continued excess capacity in the market place price pressure and new product innovations corning believes its large scale manufacturing experience fiber process technology leadership and intellectual property assets yield cost advantages relative to several of its competitors the primary competing producers of optical fiber and cable products are furukawa ofs fujikura ltd sumitomo prysmian communications and draka comteq 

for hardware and equipment products significant competitors are 3m company 3m tyco electronics furukawa ofs commscope and adc communications 

environmental technologies segment 

for worldwide automotive ceramic substrate products corning has a leading market position that has remained relatively stable over the past year corning believes its competitive advantage in automotive ceramic substrate products for catalytic converters is based upon global presence customer service engineering design services and product innovation corning has established a strong presence in the heavy duty and light duty diesel vehicle substrate market corning’s environmental technologies products face principal competition from ngk denso ibiden and emitec 

life sciences segment 

corning is a leading supplier of glass and plastic science laboratory products with a growing plastics products market presence in north america and europe and a solid laboratory glass products market presence corning seeks to maintain competitive advantages by emphasizing product quality product availability supply chain efficiency a wide product line and superior product attributes for laboratory products schott glaswerke kimble greiner and becton dickinson are the principal worldwide competitors corning also faces increasing competition from large distributors that have backward integrated or introduced private label products 

other products 

corning is a leading supplier of materials and products for lithography optics in the semiconductor industry and that market position remained relatively stable during the past year corning seeks to compete by providing superior optical quality leading optical designs and a local corning presence supporting its customers for corning’s semiconductor optical material products general specialty glassglass ceramic products and ophthalmic products schott glaswerke shinetsu quartz products hoya and heraeus are the main competitors 

samsung corning is a leading producer of cathode ray tube glass products for conventional televisions its relative competitive position has remained stable over the past year although there has been a significant decline in the industry as endmarket customers have turned to flat panel displays or projection technologies samsung corning seeks to maintain its competitive advantage through customer support logistics expertise and a lower cost manufacturing structure nippon electric glass asahi and various other asian manufacturers compete with samsung corning samsung corning is also pursuing a diversification strategy to mitigate the impact of the decline in the cathode ray tube glass 

raw materials 

corning’s production of specialty glasses ceramics and related materials requires significant quantities of energy certain precious metals and batch materials 

although energy shortages have not been a problem recently the cost of energy has increased corning has achieved flexibility through important engineering changes to take advantage of lowcost energy sources in most significant processes specifically many of corning’s principal manufacturing processes can be operated with natural gas propane oil or electricity or a combination of these energy sources 

as to resources ores minerals polymers and processed chemicals required in manufacturing operations availability appears to be adequate corning’s suppliers from time to time may experience capacity limitations in their own operations or may eliminate certain product lines nevertheless corning believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch chemicals and raw materials for many products corning has alternate glass compositions that would allow operations to continue without interruption in the event of specific materials shortages

protection of the environment 

corning has a program to ensure that its facilities are in compliance with state federal and foreign pollutioncontrol regulations this program resulted in capital and operating expenditures during the past several years in order to maintain compliance with such regulations capital expenditures for pollution control in continuing operations were approximately 50 million in 2006 and are estimated to be 13 million in 2007 

corning’s 2006 operating results from continuing operations were charged with approximately 44 million for depreciation maintenance waste disposal and other operating expenses associated with pollution control corning believes that its compliance program will not place it at a competitive disadvantage

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report future results could be materially affected by general industry and market conditions changes in laws or accounting rules general economic and political conditions including a global economic slowdown fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates terrorism political unrest or international conflicts political instability or major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this annual report 

our sales could be negatively impacted if one or more of our key customers substantially reduce orders for our products 

  corning’s ten largest customers account for about 50 of our sales no individual customer accounts for more than 10 of consolidated sales except for au optronics corporation auo which accounted for 13 of consolidated sales in 2006 

  in addition a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in each of our reportable operating segments for 2006 three customers of the display technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales represented 64 of total segment sales when combined in the telecommunications segment two customers which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales represented 25 of total segment sales when combined in the environmental technologies segment three customers which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales represented 72 of total segment sales in aggregate in the life sciences segment one distributor accounted for 43 of this segment’s sales in 2006 

  samsung corning precision’s sales were also concentrated in 2006 with sales to two lcd panel makers located in south korea accounting for approximately 92 of total samsung corning precision sales 

  although the sale of lcd glass substrates has increased in 2006 there can be no assurance that positive trends will continue our customers are lcd panel and color filter makers as they switch to larger size glass the pace of their orders may be uneven while they adjust their manufacturing processes and facilities additionally consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes price or other seasonal factors may lead to pauses in market growth from time to time our customers may not be able to maintain profitable operations or access sufficient capital to fund ongoing and future planned expansions which may limit their pace of orders to us emerging technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications resulting in a decline in demand for our lcd products 

  our telecommunications segment customers’ purchases of our products are affected by their capital expansion plans general market and economic uncertainty and regulatory changes including broadband policy sales in the telecommunications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of verizon communication inc verizon fibertothepremises deployments our sales will be dependent on verizon’s planned targets for homes passed and connected changes in verizon’s deployment plan could adversely affect future sales in any quarter or for the full year 

  in the environmental technologies segment sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for automotive and diesel emissions and pollution control are expected to fluctuate with vehicle production changes in governmental laws and regulations for air quality and emission controls may also influence future sales sales in our environmental technologies segment are to four catalyzers and emission system component manufacturers our customers sell these systems to automotive original equipment manufacturers and diesel engine manufacturers sales within this segment may be affected by adverse developments in the us auto industry or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicles sales 

  sales in our life sciences segment were historically through two large distributors to government entities pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies hospitals universities and other research facilities during 2005 we did not renew the contract with one large distributor and transitioned the sales through this distributor to our remaining primary distributor and other existing and developing channels this change had an adverse impact on sales volumes in 2006 our remaining primary distributor accounted for 43 of life sciences segment sales 

if the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate demand for our products may decline which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial performance 

  the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies evolving industry or government standards and new product introductions our success is expected to depend in substantial part on the successful introduction of new products or upgrades of current products and our ability to compete with new technologies the following factors related to our products and markets if not achieved could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

our ability to introduce leading products such as glass substrates for liquid crystal displays optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment and environmental substrate products that can command competitive prices our ability to achieve a favorable sales mix of large generation sizes of liquid crystal display glass our ability to develop new products in response to government regulations and laws particularly diesel filter products in the environmental technologies segment continued strong demand for notebook computers and lcd monitors growth in purchases of lcd televisions to replace other technologies screen size of lcd televisions which affects glass demands and growth of the fibertothepremises buildout in north america we face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance 

  we face pricing pressure in each of our leading businesses as a result of intense competition emerging new technologies or overcapacity while we will work toward reducing our costs to offset pricing pressures we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs as a result of overcapacity in the telecommunications segment we anticipate pricing pressures will continue into 2007 and beyond pricing pressure in our display technologies segment was at a historically high level in 2006 although we are taking steps to reduce the rate of price decline in 2007 we cannot be assured of success our 2007 pricing strategy may also result in lost market share 

we face risks related to our international operations and sales 

  we have customers and significant operations including manufacturing and sales located outside the us we have large manufacturing operations for liquid crystal display glass substrates in taiwan and the asiapacific region including an equity investment in samsung corning precision operating in south korea that makes glass substrates for the lcd market all of our display segment customers are located in the asiapacific region as a result of these and other international operations we face a number of risks including 

geographical concentration of our factories and operations periodic health concerns difficulty of managing global operations difficulty in protecting intellectual property tariffs duties and other trade barriers including antidumping duties undeveloped legal systems natural disasters potential power loss affecting glass production and equipment damage political and economic instability in foreign markets and foreign currency risk   any of these items could cause our sales or profitability to be significantly reduced 

we face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations 

  because we have significant customers and operations outside the us fluctuations in foreign currencies especially the japanese yen the new taiwan dollar the korean won and the euro affect our sales and profit levels foreign exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the dollar and japanese yen sales in our display technologies segment representing 41 of corning’s sales are denominated in japanese yen the expected sales growth of the display technologies segment will increase our exposure to currency fluctuations although we hedge significant transaction and balance sheet currency exposures we do not hedge translation risk and thus changes in exchange rates especially the yen may significantly impact our reported revenues and results of operations 

if the financial condition of our customers declines our credit risks could increase 

  although we have a rigorous process to administer credit and believe our reserve is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable if our customers fail to meet their payment obligations to us we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amounts reserved some customers of our display technologies segment are thinly capitalized and or marginally profitable in our environmental products segment the us auto customers and certain of their suppliers have encountered credit downgrades or in the case of delphi corporation bankruptcy these factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business as of december 31 2006 reserves for trade receivables totaled approximately 21 million 

if we do not successfully adjust our manufacturing volumes and fixed cost structure or achieve manufacturing yields or sufficient product reliability our operating results could suffer and we may not achieve anticipated profitability levels 

  we are investing heavily in additional manufacturing capacity of certain businesses including liquid crystal display glass and diesel emission substrates and filters the speed of constructing the new facilities presents challenges we may face technical and process issues in moving to commercial production there can be no assurance that corning will be able to pace its capacity expansion to the actual demand it is possible that manufacturing capacity may exceed customer demand during certain periods 

  the manufacturing of our products involves highly complex and precise processes requiring production in highly controlled and dustfree environments changes in our manufacturing processes could significantly reduce our manufacturing yields and product reliability in some cases existing manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the requirements of our customers we will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to achieve targeted volume pricing and cost levels that will permit profitable operations while we continue to fund projects to improve our manufacturing techniques and processes we may not achieve satisfactory cost levels in our manufacturing activities that will fully satisfy our profitability targets 

our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials parts and manufacturing equipment components to meet the demands of our customers 

  our ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials parts and components from our suppliers we may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages there can be no assurances that we will not encounter these problems in the future furthermore certain manufacturing equipment or components are available only from a single source or limited sources we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

we have incurred and may in the future incur restructuring and other charges the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately 

  we have recorded several charges for restructuring impairment of assets and the writeoff of cost and equity based investments it is possible we may record additional charges for restructuring or other asset impairments if additional actions become necessary 

we have incurred and may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 

  at december 31 2006 corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of 316 million while we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur 

if our products or materials purchased from our suppliers experience performance issues our business will suffer 

  our business depends on the production of products of consistently high quality our products components and materials purchased from our suppliers are typically tested for quality these testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios for various reasons our products including materials purchased from our suppliers may fail to perform as expected in some cases product redesigns or additional expense may be required to correct a defect a significant or systemic product failure could result in customer relations problems lost sales and financial damages 

we face competition in most of our businesses 

  we expect that we will face additional competition from existing competitors low cost manufacturers and new entrants we must invest in research and development expand our engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities and continue to improve customer service and support in order to remain competitive we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position 

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

  we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses we cannot assure you that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently uncertain and the outcome is often unpredictable other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios 

  the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products we are and may in the future be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation that may result in loss of revenue require us to incur substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us we cannot assure you as to the outcome of such claims 

current or future litigation may harm our financial condition or results of operations 

  pending threatened or future litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes expenses and costs exceeding amounts estimated or insured in particular we have been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos as described in legal proceedings our negotiations with the representatives of asbestos claimants produced a tentative plan of settlement through a pcc plan of reorganization but this plan has not been confirmed by the bankruptcy court the proponents of the plan have moved for reconsideration of the order entered by the court on december 21 2006 denying plan confirmation it is reasonably possible that changes to the plan may be negotiated but the elements of the plan and final approval are subject to a number of contingencies total charges of 816 million have been recorded through december 31 2006 however additional charges or credits are possible due to the potential fluctuation in the price of our common stock other adjustments in the proposed settlement and other litigation factors 

we face risks through our equity method investments in companies that we do not control 

  corning’s net income includes significant equity in earnings of associated companies for the year ended december 31 2006 we recognized 960 million of equity earnings of which 889 million came from our two largest investments dow corning corporation which makes silicone products and samsung corning precision which makes liquid crystal display glass samsung corning precision is located in the asiapacific region and is subject to political and geographic risks mentioned above as well as business and other risks within the display segment our equity investments may not continue to perform at the same levels as in recent years in 2005 and 2006 we recognized equity losses associated with samsung corning co ltd our 50 equity method investment that makes glass panels and funnels for conventional televisions which recorded fixed asset and other impairment charges as the conventional television market will be negatively impacted by strong growth in the lcd glass market it is reasonably possible that samsung corning co ltd may incur additional restructuring or impairment charges or net operating losses in the future 

we may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us 

  we face the risk of loss resulting from product liability securities fiduciary liability intellectual property antitrust contractual warranty fraud and other lawsuits whether or not such claims are valid in addition our product liability fiduciary directors and officers property natural catastrophe and comprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect our insurance costs can be volatile and at any time can increase given changes in market supply and demand we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs a successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us to pay substantial sums some of the carriers in our excess insurance programs are in liquidation and may not be able to respond if we should have claims reaching into excess layers the financial health of other insurers may deteriorate in addition we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain risk such as political risk terrorism or war 

changes in accounting may affect our reported earnings and operating income 

  generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations for many areas of our business such as revenue recognition accounting for investments and accounting for stock options are very complex and involve significant and sometimes subjective judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantly impact our reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures in the future without a corresponding change in our cash flows

none 




 item 2 properties 

we operate approximately 47 manufacturing plants and processing facilities of which approximately one half are located in the us we own substantially all of our executive and corporate buildings which are located in corning new york we also own substantially all of our manufacturing and research and development facilities and more than half of our sales and administrative facilities 

for the years ended 2006 2005 and 2004 we invested a total of 36 billion primarily in facilities outside the us in our display technologies segment of the 12 billion spent in 2006 721 million was for facilities outside the us 

manufacturing sales and administrative and research and development facilities have an aggregate floor space of approximately 24 million square feet distribution of this total area follows 

 total assets and capital expenditures by operating segment are included in note 19 operating segments to the consolidated financial statements information concerning lease commitments is included in note 14 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements 

during 2006 we continued the restructuring program that closed or consolidated certain smaller manufacturing facilities throughout 2007 we expect to have excess manufacturing capacity in our telecommunications segment and will not utilize a portion of space in the facilities listed above the largest unused portion is our optical fiber manufacturing facility in concord north carolina that has been mothballed until fiber demand rebounds we believe that the concord facility can be returned to productive capacity within six to nine months of a decision to do so 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

environmental litigation corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party at 18 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by such agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants corning has accrued approximately 16 million undiscounted for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and litigation at december 31 2006 based upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 

dow corning bankruptcy corning and dow chemical each own 50 of the common stock of dow corning in may 1995 dow corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousand breast implant product lawsuits on june 1 2004 dow corning emerged from chapter 11 with a plan of reorganization the plan which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims the plan also includes releases for corning and dow chemical as shareholders in exchange for contributions to the plan 

under the terms of the plan dow corning has established and is funding a settlement trust and a litigation facility to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate their claims inclusive of insurance dow corning has paid approximately 15 billion to the settlement trust as of december 31 2006 dow corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of 17 billion and anticipates insurance receivables of 185 million as a separate matter arising from the bankruptcy proceedings dow corning is defending claims asserted by a number of commercial creditors who claim additional interest at default rates and enforcement costs during the period from may 1995 through june 2004 on july 26 2006 the us court of appeals vacated the judgment of the district court fixing the interest component ruled that default interest and enforcement costs may be awarded subject to equitable factors to be determined and directed that the matter be remanded for further proceedings dow corning filed a petition for rehearing by the court of appeals which was denied it has filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the us supreme court which has not yet been decided as of december 31 2006 dow corning has estimated the interest payable to commercial creditors to be within the range of 68 million to 208 million as dow corning management believes no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range dow corning has recorded the minimum liability within the range should dow corning not prevail in this matter corning’s equity earnings would be reduced by its 50 share of the amount in excess of 68 million net of applicable tax benefits there are a number of other claims in the bankruptcy proceedings against dow corning awaiting resolution by the us district court and it is reasonably possible that dow corning may record bankruptcyrelated charges in the future there are no remaining tort claims against corning other than those that will be channeled by the plan into facilities established by the plan or otherwise defended by the litigation facility 

pittsburgh corning corporation corning and ppg industries inc ppg each own 50 of the capital stock of pittsburgh corning corporation pcc over a period of more than two decades pcc and several other defendants have been named in numerous lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos on april 16 2000 pcc filed for chapter 11 reorganization in the us bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania as a result of pcc’s bankruptcy filing corning recorded an aftertax charge of 36 million in 2001 to fully impair its investment in pcc and discontinued recognition of equity earnings at the time pcc filed for bankruptcy protection there were approximately 12400 claims pending against corning in state court lawsuits alleging various theories of liability based on exposure to pcc’s asbestos products and typically requesting monetary damages in excess of one million dollars per claim corning has defended those claims on the basis of the separate corporate status of pcc and the absence of any facts supporting claims of direct liability arising from pcc’s asbestos products corning is also currently named in approximately 10900 other cases approximately 42300 claims alleging injuries from asbestos and similar amounts of monetary damages per claim those cases have been covered by insurance without material impact to corning to date asbestos litigation is inherently difficult and past trends in resolving these claims may not be indicators of future outcomes

on march 28 2003 corning announced that it had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and future asbestos claims against it and pcc which might arise from pcc products or operations the proposed settlement if the plan is approved and becomes effective will require corning to relinquish its equity interest in pcc contribute its equity interest in pittsburgh corning europe nv pce a belgian corporation and contribute 25 million shares of corning common stock corning also agreed to pay a total of 140 million in six annual installments present value 131 million at march 2003 beginning one year after the plan becomes effective with 55 percent interest from june 2004 and to assign certain insurance policy proceeds from its primary insurance and a portion of its excess insurance at the time of settlement 

since march 28 2003 we have recorded total net charges of 816 million to reflect the agreed settlement contributions and subsequent adjustments for the change in the fair value of the components 

the liability expected to be settled by contribution of our investment in pce assigned insurance proceeds and the 25 million shares of our common stock totaling 656 million at december 31 2006 is recorded in the other accrued liabilities component in our consolidated balance sheets this portion of the pcc liability is considered a “due on demand” obligation and is classified as a current liability the remaining portion of the settlement liability totaling 160 million at december 31 2006 representing the net present value of the cash payments is recorded in the other liabilities component in our consolidated balance sheets 

two of corning’s primary insurers and several excess insurers have commenced litigation for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies including rights that may be affected by the settlement arrangement described above corning is vigorously contesting these cases management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation 

the pcc plan received a favorable vote from creditors in march 2004 hearings to consider objections to the plan were held in the bankruptcy court in may 2004 in february 2006 the bankruptcy court requested that the plan proponents delete references to section 105a of the bankruptcy code and resubmit the plan the final round of oral argument was held on july 21 2006 on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court issued an order denying confirmation of the plan for reasons set out in a memorandum opinion the opinion generally supports the elements of the plan except for the breadth of the channeling injunction applicable to claims against either of the two shareholders when those claims do not derive from the products or operations of pcc itself the court declared a three part test whereby other claims may be channeled if pcc is named a defendant a shareholder is named and conspiracy theories are alleged several parties including corning have filed motions of reconsideration which are scheduled for a hearing before the bankruptcy court on march 5 2007 if the bankruptcy court does not approve the pcc plan in its current form changes to the plan are probable as it is likely that the court will allow the proponents time to propose amendments the outcome of these proceedings is uncertain and confirmation of the current plan or any amended plan is subject to a number of contingencies however apart from the quarterly marktomarket adjustment in the value of the components of the settlement management believes that the likelihood of a material adverse impact to corning’s financial statements is remote

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our key priorities for 2006 remained unchanged from the previous two years protect our financial health improve our profitability and invest in the future we made significant progress on all three in 2006 

financial health 

in 2006 our balance sheet remained strong and we delivered positive cash flows from operating activities significant activities in 2006 included the following 

we issued 250 million aggregate principal amount of 725 senior unsecured notes due 2036 for general corporate purposes and in support of an objective to extend the timing of future debt maturities we reduced our longterm debt in the following transactions  we received 171 million in deposits against orders relating to our multiyear supply agreements with customers in the display technologies segment these agreements have helped us to meet the rapid growth of the lcd market all three of our rating agencies upgraded our ratings to either bbb or baa2 we generated cash flows from operating activities in excess of our capital expenditures we ended 2006 with 32 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments this represents an increase of 733 million from december 31 2005 

in november 2006 we amended our revolving credit facility so that it now provides us access to a 11 billion unsecured multicurrency revolving line of credit through march 2011 we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments 

profitability 

for the year ended december 31 2006 we generated net income of 1855 million or 116 per share compared to net income of 585 million or 038 per share for 2005 

we recorded restructuring impairment and other charges and credits in the past three years which affect the comparability of those years refer to note 3 restructuring impairment and other charges and credits note 7 income taxes and note 8 investments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

investing in our future 

we remain committed to investing in research development and engineering to drive innovation we are investing in a wide variety of technologies with a focus on glass substrates for active matrix lcds diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that will enable fibertothepremises 

our research development and engineering expenditures have increased by 74 million or 17 compared to 2005 we believe our spending levels are adequate to support our growth strategies 

we also remain committed to investing in manufacturing capacity to match increased demand in our businesses our capital expenditures are primarily focused on expanding manufacturing capacity for lcd glass substrates in the display technologies segment and diesel products in the environmental technologies segment total capital expenditures for 2006 were 1182 million of which 829 million was directed toward our display technologies segment and 146 million was invested in our environmental technologies segment primarily in anticipation of the emerging market for diesel emission control systems 

we expect our 2007 capital spending to be in the range of 11 billion to 12 billion of which approximately 700 million will be directed toward our display technologies segment and approximately 100 million will be directed toward our environmental technologies segment 

results of continuing operations 

selected highlights from our continuing operations follow dollars in millions 

 net sales 

the net sales increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was the result of increased demand for lcd glass substrates in our display technologies segment and yearoveryear increased volume in the telecommunications segment net sales for all other segments were comparable to the prior year movements in foreign exchange rates negatively impacted 2006 net sales by approximately 125 million or 3 when compared with 2005 

the net sales increase in 2005 compared to 2004 was the result of a significant increase in demand for lcd glass substrates in our display technologies segment modest gains in demand for products in our telecommunications segment to support fibertothepremises projects and in our environmental technologies segment also contributed to the sales increase the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on 2005 net sales was less than 1 when compared with net sales in 2004 

reflecting the growth in our display technologies segment net sales into international markets continued to surpass those into the us market for 2006 2005 and 2004 sales into international markets accounted for 71 71 and 65 of net sales respectively 

cost of sales 

the types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are raw materials consumption including direct and indirect materials salaries wages and benefits depreciation and amortization production utilities productionrelated purchasing warehousing including receiving and inspection repairs and maintenance interlocation inventory transfer costs production and warehousing facility property insurance rent for production facilities and other production overhead 

gross margin 

as a percentage of net sales 2006 gross margin was up slightly from 2005 driven primarily by our display technologies segment gross margins for this segment were essentially even with 2005 reflecting the negative impact of price declines offset by higher volumes and cost reductions display technologies segment sales increased from 38 of total corning’s sales in 2005 to 41 of corning’s sales in 2006 as display technologies has a higher gross margin than our consolidated gross margin the added concentration in display technologies in 2006 caused corning’s gross margin percentage to increase from 43 in 2005 to 44 in 2006 

for 2005 as a percentage of net sales gross margin improved 6 percentage points versus 2004 the improvement was driven by increased volume improved mix of large generation glass and manufacturing efficiencies in our display technologies segment 

selling general and administrative expenses 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses for 2006 compared to 2005 in dollars was primarily due to an increase in stockbased compensation expense as a result of the company’s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment sfas 123r effective january 1 2006 the increase in spending in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily driven by increases in compensation costs as a percent of net sales selling general and administrative expenses were comparable for all periods presented 

the types of expenses included in the selling general and administrative expenses line item are salaries wages and benefits travel sales commissions professional fees and depreciation and amortization utilities and rent for administrative facilities 

sharebased compensation 

prior to january 1 2006 the company accounted for sharebased awards granted under the company’s stock compensation programs using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” apb 25 and sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas 123 under the intrinsic value method no sharebased compensation cost related to stock options had been recognized in the company’s consolidated statements of operations because the exercise price was at least equal to the market value of the common stock on the grant date as a result the recognition of sharebased compensation cost was generally limited to the expense attributed to restricted stock awards and stock option modifications as permitted under sfas 123 the company reported proforma disclosures presenting results and earnings per share as if we had used the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123 in the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

effective january 1 2006 the company adopted the provisions of sfas 123r using the modified prospective application method under the modified prospective application method compensation cost recognized in 2006 includes a compensation cost for all sharebased awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 1 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas 123 and b compensation cost for all sharebased awards granted subsequent to january 1 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r compensation cost is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award in accordance with the modified prospective application method results for prior periods have not been restated the adoption of sfas 123r resulted in a decrease of 005 in basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2006 see note 18 sharebased compensation to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the impact of sfas 123r 

research development and engineering expenses 

research development and engineering expenditures increased by 74 million in 2006 when compared to 2005 but remained consistent as a percentage of net sales expenditures in 2006 were focused on our display technologies environmental technologies and telecommunications segments as we looked to capitalize on market opportunities in those segments expenses in 2006 also included costs associated with exploratory projects to support future growth expenditures increased in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to increased spending to support growth initiatives including glass substrates for lcds diesel filter and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards as well as exploratory projects 

restructuring impairment and other charges and credits 

corning recorded significant net charges in 2004 which affect the comparability of our results for 2006 2005 and 2004 a summary of the net charges and credits for all years presented is provided in the following table in millions 

   impairment of goodwill 

  2004 impairment charge 

pursuant to sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas 142 goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in addition goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its related carrying value in the third quarter of 2004 we identified certain factors that caused us to lower our estimates and projections for the longterm revenue growth of the telecommunications segment which indicated that the fair value of the telecommunications segment reporting unit was less than its carrying value we performed an interim impairment test of the telecommunications segment goodwill in the third quarter of 2004 and as a result recorded an impairment charge of 1420 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value at september 30 2004 of 117 million 

  impairment of longlived assets other than goodwill 

given our restructuring actions and the market conditions facing certain of our businesses at various times throughout 2004 to 2006 we performed evaluations of the recoverability of our held for use longlived assets other than goodwill when an impairment evaluation was required we developed expected future cash flows against which to compare the carrying value of the asset group being evaluated if our projections indicated that our long lived assets were not recoverable through future cash flows we were then required to estimate the fair value of the longlived assets limited to property plant and equipment using the expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value 

  2006 impairment charge 

  assets to be held and used 

in 2006 we recorded an asset held for use impairment charge of 44 million to impair certain longlived assets of our telecommunications segment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” sfas 144 due to our lowered longterm outlook for this business we determined that an event of impairment as defined by sfas 144 had occurred in that business which further required us to test this asset group for impairment we assess recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we estimated the fair value of the longlived assets for this business using a discounted expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value as a result of our impairment evaluation we recorded an impairment charge to writedown the asset group to its estimated fair value 

  2004 impairment charge 

  assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment 

  these charges comprise the following 

telecommunications segment  in 2004 we recorded a net charge of 344 million to impair plant and equipment related to certain facilities to be disposed of or shutdown approximately 332 million of this net charge was comprised of the partially completed sections of our concord nc optical fiber facility as a result of our lowered outlook we have permanently abandoned this construction in progress as we no longer believe the demand for optical fiber will warrant the investment necessary to complete this facility we have mothballed and will continue to depreciate the separate previouslyoperated portion of the concord fiber facility   other businesses  we recorded net credits of 42 million primarily for gains on the sale of assets corning asahi video products cav sold to a third party in china this represented proceeds in excess of assumed salvage values for assets previously impaired this represented the substantial completion of the sale of cav’s assets   assets to be held and used 

in 2004 due to our decision to permanently abandon certain assets and lower our longterm outlook for the telecommunications segment in 2004 we determined that an event of impairment had occurred in our telecommunications segment which required us to test the segment’s longlived assets other than goodwill for impairment as a result of this impairment evaluation we recorded a 24 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2004 to writedown certain assets to fair value 

  other credits 

  2005 reversal of currency translation adjustment 

in 2003 corning sold its photonic business operations to avanex the photonics business was the sole operation of corning oti srl oti a whollyowned italian subsidiary of corning whose results were included in corning’s telecommunications segment subsequent to the sale of the operating assets of oti to avanex corning began liquidating oti in october 2005 the assets of oti were determined to be substantially liquidated as a result of the substantial liquidation oti’s cumulative translation account was reversed resulting in a gain of 84 million in the fourth quarter 

  accelerated depreciation 

  2004 accelerated depreciation 

we recorded 37 million of accelerated depreciation relating to the final shutdown of our semiconductor materials manufacturing facility in charleston south carolina which we announced in the fourth quarter of 2003 

  loss on sale of businesses 

  2004 loss on sale of business 

on september 1 2004 we completed the sale of our frequency controls business which was part of the telecommunications segment for net cash proceeds of 80 million we recorded a loss on the sale of 14 million which included an allocation of 30 million of the telecommunications segment goodwill 

  impairment of available for sale securities 

  2005 impairment charge 

in 2005 we recorded impairment charges of 25 million for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our investment in avanex corporation avanex below its adjusted cost basis our investment in avanex was accounted for as an availableforsale security under sfas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” sfas 115 in the fourth quarter of 2005 we completed the sale of our shares of avanex 

  restructuring actions 

  2005 restructuring actions 

corning recorded net restructuring charges of 15 million in 2005 which included the following 

a charge of 30 million comprising severance costs for a restructuring plan in the telecommunications segment to continue to reduce costs in this segment   net credits to prior year restructuring plans totaling 15 million primarily for revisions to plans related to the shutdown of corning asahi video products and to our specialty materials business legal settlement  asbestos 

on march 28 2003 we announced that we had reached agreement with the representatives of current and future asbestos claimants on a settlement arrangement that was thereafter incorporated into the pittsburgh corning corporation pcc plan of reorganization the pcc plan this settlement remains subject to a number of contingencies including approval by the bankruptcy court if the pcc plan is approved and becomes effective our settlement will require corning to relinquish its equity interest in pcc contribute its equity interest in pittsburgh corning europe nv pce and contribute 25 million shares of corning common stock the common stock and other components of the settlement will be markedtomarket each quarter until the pcc plan is approved thus resulting in adjustments to income and the settlement liability as appropriate corning will also make cash payments of 140 million net present value of 131 million at march 2003 in six installments beginning one year after the plan is effective in addition we will assign insurance policy proceeds from our primary insurance and a portion of our excess insurance as part of the settlement two of corning’s primary insurers and several excess insurers have commenced litigation for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies including rights that may be affected by the settlement arrangement described above corning is vigorously contesting these cases management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation 

the pcc plan received a favorable vote from creditors in march 2004 hearings to consider objections to the pcc plan were held in the bankruptcy court in may 2004 in february 2006 the bankruptcy court requested that the pcc plan proponents delete references to section 105a of the bankruptcy code and resubmit the pcc plan the final round of oral argument was held on july 21 2006 on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court issued an order denying confirmation of the pcc plan for reasons set out in a memorandum opinion several parties including corning have filed motions for reconsideration which are scheduled for a hearing before the bankruptcy court on march 5 2007 if the bankruptcy court does not approve the pcc plan in its current form changes to the pcc plan are probable as it is likely that the court will allow the proponents time to propose amendments the outcome of these proceedings is uncertain and confirmation of the current plan or any amended plan is subject to a number of contingencies however apart from the quarterly marktomarket adjustment in the value of the 25 million shares of corning stock management believes that the likelihood of a material adverse impact to corning’s financial statements is remote 

the following summarizes the charges and gains we have recorded for the asbestos settlement in millions 

 see legal proceedings for additional information about this matter 

income loss from continuing operations before income taxes 

in addition to the items identified under gross margin restructuring impairment and other charges and credits and asbestos settlement we retired a significant amount of our outstanding debentures during 2006 2005 and 2004 that resulted in losses of 11 million 16 million and 36 million respectively 

movements in currency exchange rates negatively impacted income loss from continuing operations in 2006 and 2005 when compared to the respective previous years 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax benefit rates were as follows in millions 

 the effective income tax rate for 2006 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following items 

the impact of not recording tax expense on income generated in the us the release of valuation allowances on all australian deferred tax assets and on a portion of our deferred tax assets in germany and the benefit of tax holidays in foreign jurisdictions in 2004 and 2005 we recorded valuation allowances against our entire us deferred tax assets because we incurred significant losses in the us in recent years as a result our tax provision in these years has included only the net tax expense attributable to certain foreign operations while we did generate income from continuing operations in the us in 2006 such income was largely offset by tax adjustments not reflected in our continuing operations in the absence of an appropriate level of overall profitability in the us we did not record tax expense on income from continuing operations in the us in 2006 resulting in a reduction in our effective tax rate of 142 

in 2004 we also recorded valuation allowances against most of our foreign deferred tax assets in 2006 due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections in both australia and at certain of our german operations we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the underlying tax benefits are realizable and released valuation allowances resulting in a reduction in our effective tax rate of 87 

certain foreign subsidiaries in china south africa and taiwan are operating under tax holiday arrangements the nature and extent of such arrangements vary and the benefits of such arrangements phase out in years 2006 to 2010 according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 101 89 and 12 for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

in addition to the aforementioned benefit of tax holidays the effective income tax rate for 

2005 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to tax expense of 525 million to increase corning’s valuation allowance 2004 differed from the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to establishing a valuation allowance against certain domestic us federal state and local and foreign deferred tax assets and the writeoff of nondeductible goodwill in 2004 significant events occurred which required us to increase our valuation allowances against certain us and german deferred tax assets resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate of 789 refer to note 3 restructuring impairment and other charges and credits for additional information on these events and the related charges at that time we believed that it was more likely than not that we could realize the remaining net us deferred tax assets of approximately 525 million through a tax planning strategy involving the sale of our investment in dow corning a nonstrategic appreciated asset if we were faced with expiring net operating loss carryforwards 

during 2005 dow corning’s performance was much stronger than expected and dow corning resumed paying a dividend both of which are expected to continue in the future due to this improved performance we concluded that dow corning provides strong financial geographic and market balance to corning’s portfolio of businesses the profitability of which has become more concentrated due to the success of the display operating segment as a result we considered dow corning to be a strategic investment and could no longer assert that a potential tax planning strategy involving the sale of dow corning would be prudent as required by sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” sfas 109 therefore we no longer believed in the fourth quarter of 2005 that it was more likely than not that we would realize the remaining net deferred tax assets accordingly we increased our valuation allowance by 525 million to fully reserve our net us deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2005 which increased our effective tax rate by 94 

during the third quarter of 2005 corning filed its 2004 consolidated us federal income tax return which included a 39 billion worthless stock deduction for the loss on our investment in the photonic technologies business associated with the pirelli acquisition this acquisition was completed in december 2000 and was substantially impaired in the second quarter of 2001 prior to the third quarter of 2005 we did not record a deferred tax asset for this item as the ultimate realization of such deduction was uncertain and consistent with the requirements of sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” recognition of an asset prior to the time management determines the realization of the asset is probable is prohibited on september 2 2005 corning and the commissioner of the irs entered into a closing agreement under section 7121 of the internal revenue code of 1986 which provides that corning is entitled to this worthless stock deduction we recorded a 15 billion deferred tax asset for this item in the third quarter which was concurrently offset by a valuation allowance of an equal amount due to our inability to record tax benefits for us net operating losses the net result had no impact of our effective tax rate for 2005 

equity in earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments 

the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments in millions 

 the 2006 and 2005 increases in equity earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments are primarily due to strong sales and earnings performance at samsung corning precision and at dow corning 

in addition to the above equity in earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments included the following restructuring and impairment charges and other credits 

in 2006 dow corning reached settlement with the irs regarding liabilities for tax years 1992 to 2003 equity earnings reflected a 33 million gain as a result of the settlement which resolved all federal tax issues related to dow corning’s implant settlement in 2006 samsung corning recorded the following items which increased corning’s equity earnings by 2 million net a gain on the sale of land which increased corning’s equity earnings by 61 million an impairment charge on certain longlived assets which reduced corning’s equity earnings by 46 million and the establishment of a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets which reduced corning’s equity earnings by 13 million in 2005 samsung corning incurred impairment and other charges as a result of a decline in the projected operating results for its cathode ray tube crt glass business the charge which included certain manufacturing assets and severance and exit costs reduced corning’s equity earnings by 106 million in the third quarter in 2005 dow corning recorded a gain on the issuance of subsidiary stock corning’s equity earnings included 11 million related to this gain in 2004 corning incurred charges of 35 million to impaire quity method investments in the telecommunications segment to their estimated fair value in 2004 dow corning recorded charges related to restructuring actions and adjustments to interest liabilities recorded on its emergence from bankruptcy corning’s equity earnings included 21 million related to these charges in 2003 2005 and 2006 samsung corning recorded significant fixed asset and other impairment charges as the conventional television glass market will be negatively impacted by strong growth in the lcd glass market it is reasonably possible that samsung corning may incur additional restructuring or impairment charges or operating losses in the foreseeable future samsung corning is currently investing in several developing businesses which samsung corning management believes will offset the decline in conventional television glass market over time should these new businesses not achieve expected results additional operating losses asset impairments and restructuring charges are likely to occur and samsung corning’s longterm financial viability may come into question these events could result in corning incurring an impairment of its investment in samsung corning corning management believes it is more likely than not that an impairment of our investment will occur in the foreseeable future corning’s investment in samsung corning was 254 million at december 31 2006 

income loss from continuing operations 

as a result of the items discussed above the income loss from continuing operations and per share data was as follows in millions except per share amounts 

 results of discontinued operations 

in the third quarter of 2004 corning and 3m reached a final settlement agreement for funds held in escrow associated with the 2002 sale of corning’s precision lens business to 3m as a result we recognized a 20 million gain upon receipt of the proceeds in 2004 

operating segments 

our reportable operating segments include display technologies telecommunications environmental technologies and life sciences the environmental technologies reportable segment is an aggregation of our automotive and diesel operating segments as these two segments share similar economic characteristics products customer types production processes and distribution methods the following provides a brief description of the products and markets served by each reportable segment 

display technologies – manufactures liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays telecommunications – manufactures optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment components for the worldwide telecommunications industry environmental technologies – manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automobile and diesel applications and life sciences – manufactures glass and plastic consumables for scientific applications we prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions we include the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segment’s net income we have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for standalone financial information prepared in accordance with gaap these expenses include interest taxes and corporate functions segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements 

on january 1 2006 corning changed its measurement of segment profit or loss as follows 

we removed the net impact of financing costs such as interest expense on debt instruments and interest costs associated with benefit plans from reportable segments and included these amounts in corporate unallocated expense we changed the allocation method for taxes to more closely reflect the company’s current tax position we removed the impact of noncash stock compensation expense from reportable segments and included this amount in corporate unallocated expense 32 

we removed the allocation of exploratory research development and engineering expense from reportable segments and included these amounts in corporate unallocated expense we changed certain other allocation methods for corporate functions the following discussion reflects segment information that has been revised to reflect the changes to segment performance measurement as described above

the net sales increase for 2006 continues to reflect overall lcd glass market growth during 2006 glass substrate volumes measured in square feet of glass sold increased 52 compared with 2005 driven by increased lcd monitor and tv market penetration demand for largersize substrates generation 5 and above and continued strong demand for glass for notebook computers sales of largesize glass substrates which carry a slightly higher selling price per square foot accounted for 82 of 2006 sales volumes compared to 69 in 2005 the growth in volume was partially offset by declines in weighted average selling prices of approximately 16 sales of the display technologies segment are denominated primarily in the japanese yen movements in the us dollar – japanese yen exchange rate negatively impacted 2006 sales by approximately 122 million or 7 when compared with 2005 

in the second quarter of 2006 the display technologies segment reported its first quarterly sequential decline in volume since the third quarter of 2001 the lower volume was the result of a number of our customers primarily in taiwan idling part of their facilities and thus reducing their demand for glass as a result of a buildup of panel inventory in the supply chain in comparison to the second quarter of 2006 both volume and sales increased in the third quarter of 2006 as expected our customers reduced their inventories and began ramping up lcd panel production to meet seasonally stronger demand expected in the fourth quarter 

for 2006 the increase in income before equity earnings was primarily the result of higher volumes as described above and manufacturing cost reductions offset somewhat by lower prices and the impact of exchange rates movements in currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2006 income before equity earnings by approximately 5 when compared with 2005 

the increase in our equity earnings primarily from samsung corning precision was largely driven by the same market factors identified for our wholly owned business except that the impact of the panel maker inventory build in korea in the second quarter of 2006 was not as significant in 2006 samsung corning precision’s earnings were negatively impacted by approximately 8 from movements in exchange rates compared to 2005 equity earnings from samsung corning precision are susceptible to movements in the us dollar–japanese yen and us dollar–korean won exchange rates 

the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan and taiwan on october 1 2006 au optronics corporation auo a customer of the display technologies segment completed its previously announced merger with quanta display inc qdi another customer of corning’s display technologies segment in addition through two subsequent transactions auo now holds a 49 equity stake in toppan cfi a subsidiary of toppan printing co ltd also a customer of the display technologies segment as a result of these transactions auo qdi and toppan cfi are considered to be a single customer reported as auo for 2006 auo including qdi and toppan cfi chi mei optoelectronics corporation and sharp corporation which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for 64 of total segment sales when combined 

in addition samsung corning precision’s sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers in 2006 sales to two lcd panel makers located in korea samsung electronics co ltd and lg phillips lcd co ltd accounted for approximately 92 of total samsung corning precision sales 

in 2005 and 2004 corning and several customers entered into longterm purchase and supply agreements in which the display technologies segment agreed to supply largesize glass substrates to the customers over periods of up to six years as part of the agreements these customers agreed to make advance cash deposits to corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased in 2006 corning received 171 million of customer deposits and issued 126 million in credit memoranda refer to note 11 other liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in the event the customers do not make all customer deposit installment payments or elect not to purchase the agreed upon quantities of product subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits if corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements corning may be required to return certain amounts of the customer deposits in the ordinary course of business corning will continue to negotiate multiyear supply agreements with its large customers where feasible but we believe it is unlikely that we will negotiate agreements that require additional deposits 

corning is investing heavily to expand capacity to meet increasing demand for lcd glass substrates in 2006 capital spending was 829 million and is expected to be approximately 700 million in 2007 capital spending in 2007 will be used primarily to expand manufacturing facilities in taichung taiwan and shizuoka japan 

2005 vs 2004 

the 2005 sales increase reflected the overall growth of the lcd glass substrate market during 2005 glass substrate volumes increased approximately 64 compared with 2004 for 2005 largesize glass substrates accounted for 69 of total sales volumes compared to 46 in 2004 movements in the us dollar – japanese yen exchange rate did not have a significant impact on the comparability of sales 

for 2005 the key drivers for the increase in income before equity earnings were higher volumes ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and a lower effective tax rate movements in currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on income before equity earnings the increase in our equity earnings from samsung corning precision was largely driven by higher volumes and ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies 

outlook we expect to see a continuation of the overall industry growth and the trend toward large size substrates driven by increased end market demand for lcd televisions we anticipate the volume growth in the lcd glass market to be in the mid30 range in 2007 the expected market volume growth measured in square feet for the year should be equal to or greater than the volume growth in the market in 2006 corning’s lcd glass volume is expected to grow at the upper end of this range while samsung corning precision’s volume growth may be slightly lower growth rates by region for the industry generally and thus for corning’s wholly owned business and samsung corning precision may be different based on market dynamics 

we believe prices will decline in 2007 but not to the extent that we experienced in 2006 we also expect to be able to reduce our manufacturing costs to address the impact of price declines we expect price declines of 12 in the first quarter of 2007 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 

as glass for lcd television becomes a higher percentage of total lcd glass demand we anticipate that our business will become more seasonal we currently anticipate that glass volume will decline 1015 in the first quarter from the seasonally strong fourth quarter of 2006 and that sales and earnings in this segment will be more concentrated in the second half of 2007 than in prior years 

although we believe that end market demand for lcd televisions monitors and notebooks remains strong we are cautious about the potential negative impact that economic conditions and political tensions could have on consumer demand there is no assurance that the endmarket rates of growth will continue at the rates experienced in recent years that we will be able to pace our capacity expansions to actual demand or that the rate of cost declines will offset price declines in any given period while the industry has grown rapidly consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes prices or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth therefore it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time in addition changes in foreign exchange rates principally the japanese yen will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment 

telecommunications 

the following table provides net sales and other data for the telecommunications segment dollars in millions 

 2006 vs 2005 

increases in telecommunications segment net sales were driven by improved sales in north america europe and china the increase was driven by a broader recovery in the telecommunications industry including greater deployment of fibertothe premises products and growth in the private network market the volume increase was offset somewhat by continued price declines when compared to 2005 movements in foreign exchange rates which can affect this segment’s net sales primarily the euro and japanese yen did not have a significant impact on sales in 2006 when compared to the previous year 

effective april 1 2006 acs an equity company affiliate assumed responsibility for optical cable and hardware and equipment sales in japan as a result sales in 2006 were negatively impacted as acs which is accounted for under the equity method began to sell into the japanese market sales of optical cable and hardware and equipment in japan which are now recorded by an equity affiliate were 75 million in 2005 and 23 million in the first quarter of 2006 

in 2006 we recorded an asset held for use impairment charge of 44 million to impair certain longlived assets of our cabling business in accordance with sfas 144 due to our lowered longterm outlook for this business we determined that an event of impairment as defined by sfas 144 had occurred which further required us to test this asset group for impairment we assess recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we estimated the fair value of the longlived assets for this business using the expected cash flows discounted cash flow approach as a measure of fair value associated with these assets as a result of our impairment evaluation we recorded an impairment charge to writedown the asset group to its estimated fair value 

for the telecommunications segment net income in 2006 and 2005 was impacted by restructuring impairment and other charges and credits in 2006 we recorded an aftertax impairment charge of 44 million described above in 2005 we recorded net aftertax credits of 47 million refer to results of continuing operations for a discussion of these charges the decline in net income for this segment in 2006 when compared to 2005 was primarily the result of the 2006 impairment charge described above and the absence of net aftertax credits of 47 million that were recorded in 2005 movements in exchange rates did not significantly impact the results for this operating segment 

the telecommunications segment has a concentrated customer base in 2006 two customers of the telecommunications segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of total segment net sales accounted for 25 of total segment sales when combined 

2005 vs 2004 

results for the telecommunications segment reflected a solid performance in 2005 the net sales increase was largely driven by sales in north america and europe excluding the impact of the frequency controls business a hardware and equipment manufacturer sold in september 2004 net sales for the telecommunications segment increased 10 in 2005 when compared to the previous year movements in exchange rates did not significantly impact sales for either 2005 or 2004 

for the telecommunications segment net income in 2005 and the net loss in 2004 were impacted by restructuring impairment and other charges and credits in 2005 we recorded net aftertax credits of 47 million related to these items and in 2004 we recorded aftertax charges of 1798 million refer to results of continuing operations for a detailed discussion of these charges 

outlook for the telecommunications segment we expect sales and earnings to increase in 2007 reflecting a broaderbased increase in demand than in the last two years however sales will still be impacted by the seasonal buying patterns of our largest customer changes in our customer’s expected deployment plan or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fibertothepremises products could also affect the sales level should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated our sales and earnings would be adversely affected 

environmental technologies 

the following table provides net sales and other data for the environmental technologies segment dollars in millions 

 2006 vs 2005 

sales of this segment in 2006 were somewhat higher than last year due to improvements in diesel products sales primarily for lightduty diesel vehicle applications however we also experienced a decline in automotive product sales due to lower volumes as end customers shift demand toward smaller more energy efficient vehicles demand for larger automobiles has declined this shift in demand has caused our automotive substrate volumes to decline because our market share is relatively higher for manufacturers of larger vehicles in addition volumes have been negatively impacted because smaller vehicles require proportionately smaller substrates movements in exchange rates did not have a significant impact on sales for this segment 

the decrease in net income in 2006 versus 2005 was due primarily to increased research development and engineering spending in preparation for the growth in sales of heavy duty and light duty diesel products 

2005 vs 2004 

the 2005 increase in net sales was the result of continued growth in diesel products sales for automotive products sales in 2005 were flat when compared to prior year the 2005 decrease in net income compared to 2004 resulted primarily from increased operating expenses primarily to support our emerging diesel products movements in exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales or net income of this segment in 2005 when compared to 2004 

the environmental technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of manufacturers of catalyzers and emission control systems who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers the use of substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel engine manufacturers in 2006 three customers of the environmental technologies segment which individually accounted for more than 10 of segment net sales accounted for 72 of total segment sales 

outlook we expect both sales and earnings improvements in the environmental technologies segment in 2007 automotive substrate sales are expected to remain even with 2006 levels diesel products sales are expected to increase more than 60 in 2007 as regulations that require heavy duty diesel filters such as ours to meet tighter emission standards became effective in the us on january 1 2007 segment profitability is expected to increase due to higher diesel volumes and manufacturing cost reductions changes in automotive production could adversely impact sales and net income of this segment 

life sciences 

the following table provides net sales and other data for the life sciences segment dollars in millions 

 2006 vs 2005 

net sales of the life sciences segment were up slightly in 2006 when compared to 2005 due to increased prices offset by volume declines in the us movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of sales 

the segment continues to operate at a loss due to significant research development and engineering spending related to the epic ® system a highthroughput labelfree screening platform based on optical biosensor technology which had its market launch in 2006 the segment loss also includes 5 million of severance curtailment and asset impairment costs related to the shutdown of a facility in the united kingdom 

in the life sciences segment one customer accounted for approximately 43 of this segment’s net sales in 2006 

2005 vs 2004 

the decrease in net sales in 2005 when compared to 2004 was due to volume decreases as a result of a change in our distribution channel that was made in early 2005 prior to 2005 approximately 56 of the life sciences segment sales were to two distributors who in turn sold to endusers such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies government entities academic institutions and other research facilities as a result of a change in business strategy by one of the distributors corning did not renew the distribution agreement approximately 30 of life sciences 2004 sales were made through this distributor as expected the change had a negative impact on sales volumes in 2005 

the net loss in 2005 was due to lower sales and higher operating expenses to implement the change in distribution channels and to support new product development efforts movement in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of this segment’s net sales or net income for 2005 and 2004 

outlook sales for 2007 are expected to increase slightly over 2006 we expect a lower net loss for 2007 as a result of higher sales and the absence of severance and curtailment charges 

unallocated and other 

the following table provides net sales and other data dollars in millions 

 unallocated and other includes all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting 

sales in this segment for 2006 were higher than last year due to increased sales in the specialty materials business net income for 2006 and net loss for 2005 reflected the impact of impairment and other charges and credits recorded by samsung corning co ltd in 2006 and 2005 corning’s share of these items was a credit of 2 million and a charge of 106 million respectively refer to note 8 investments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

liquidity and capital resources 

financing activities 

during 2006 we had a number of significant financing transactions as follows 

we redeemed the entire 125 million principal amount of our 83 mediumterm notes due april 4 2025 which at the redemption date had a book value of 129 million we redeemed 119 million of our 625 euro notes due february 18 2010 we recognized a loss of 8 million upon the early redemption of these notes we repurchased 96 million principal amount of our 63 notes due march 1 2009 we recognized a loss of 3 million upon the repurchase of these notes we issued 250 million of 725 senior unsecured notes for net proceeds of approximately 246 million for general corporate purposes and in support of an objective to extend the timing of future debt maturities although the notes mature on august 15 2036 we can redeem or repurchase them at any time refer to note 12 debt to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

in november 2006 we amended our revolving credit facility so that it now provides us access to a 11 billion unsecured multicurrency revolving line of credit through march 2011 the facility includes two financial covenants a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio at december 31 2006 we were in compliance with both financial covenants 

customer deposits 

certain customers of our display technologies segment have entered into longterm supply agreements and agreed to make advance cash deposits to secure supply of largesize glass substrates the deposits will be reduced through future product purchases thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods 

customer deposits have been or will be received in the following periods in millions 

 in 2006 and 2005 we issued 126 million and 29 million respectively in credit memoranda these credit amounts are not included in the above amounts and were applied against customer receivables 

in 2007 we expect to issue credits in the range of 250 million to 300 million 

capital spending 

capital spending totaled 12 billion 16 billion and 857 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively capital spending activity in all three years primarily included expansion of lcd glass capacity in the display technologies segment and new capacity for diesel products in the environmental technologies segment our 2007 capital spending program is expected to be in the range of 11 billion to 12 billion with approximately 700 million used to expand manufacturing capacity for lcd glass substrates in the display technologies segment additionally approximately 100 million will be directed toward our environmental technologies segment to support the emerging diesel emissions control products 

restructuring 

during 2006 2005 and 2004 we made payments of 15 million 25 million and 85 million respectively related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions cash payments for employeerelated costs will be substantially completed by the end of 2007 while payments for exit activities will be substantially completed by the end of 2010 

key balance sheet data 

at december 31 2006 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 32 billion compared with 24 billion at december 31 2005 the increase from december 31 2005 was primarily due to operating cash flows of 18 billion 

balance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table dollars in millions 

 39 

credit ratings 

as of february 26 2007 our credit ratings were as follows 

 management assessment of liquidity 

our major source of funding for 2007 and beyond will be our operating cash flow our existing balances of cash cash equivalents and short term investments and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options from time to time we may issue debt securities to refinance debt securities maturing in the next few years we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations restructuring the asbestos settlement research and development capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments due to the significant increase in cash cash equivalents and short term investments over the past few years during 2007 we will evaluate further reductions in our longterm debt share repurchases and dividends 

off balance sheet arrangements 

off balance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 

corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include the following 

guarantee contracts that require applying the provisions of fasb interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” fin 45 and variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities fin 45 requires a company at the time a guarantee is issued to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes in the normal course of our business we do not routinely provide significant thirdparty guarantees generally thirdparty guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees including standby letters of credit and performance bonds and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones these guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant 

refer to note 14 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

corning leases certain transportation equipment from three trusts that qualify as variable interest entities under fin 46r consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51 revised fin 46r the sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to corning 

for variable interest entities we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by fin 46r the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of its expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests which are the ownership contractual or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests 

corning is the primary beneficiary of one of the three entities and as required by fin 46r the financial statements of the entity are included in corning’s consolidated financial statements corning is not the primary beneficiary of two of the three variable interest entities and as such fin 46r does not require corning to include them in it’s consolidated financial statements 

refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

corning does not have retained interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit liquidity or market risk support to that entity 

in the reporting year 2005 and prior to adopting sfas 123r corning had employee compensation awards stock options that were excluded from the balance sheet sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas 133 requires all derivative instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value paragraph 11a of sfas no 133provides an exception to this requirement for contracts that are indexed to an entity’s own stock and classified in the shareholders’ equity section of the consolidated financial statements therefore prior to adopting sfas 123r employee stock option awards were excluded from the balance sheet because they met the paragraph 11a criteria in 2006 those options are recorded in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet in 2005 and in the first quarter of 2006 we had other nonemployee contracts that did not meet the criteria in paragraph 11a those contracts were considered derivative instruments and were accounted for as such in the respective reporting periods 

contractual obligations 

the amounts of our obligations follow in millions 

  41 

we have provided financial guarantees and contingent liabilities in the form of standby letters of credit and performance bonds some of which do not have fixed or scheduled expiration dates we have agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow corning as noted above and discussed in note 8 investments and note 14 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements the funding of the dow corning credit facility will be required only if dow corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed bankruptcy plan we believe the significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 

pensions 

we have a number of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees our largest single pension plan is corning’s us qualified plan at december 31 2006 this plan accounted for 79 of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation and 90 of the related plans’ assets 

at december 31 2004 the accumulated benefit obligation abo for our domestic qualified and nonqualified plans and several international plans exceeded the fair value of related plan assets requiring corning to record an additional minimum pension liability in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” sfas 87 however in 2005 due primarily to contributions of corning stock to the domestic qualified pension plan the fair value of this plan’s assets at december 31 2005 exceeded the abo and accordingly corning eliminated this plan’s minimum pension liability 

at december 31 2006 corning adopted sfas 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plansan amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” sfas 158 sfas 158 requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in accumulated other comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur the impact of adopting sfas 158 resulted in a reduction to stockholders’ equity of 669 million after tax dow corning’s adoption of this standard resulted in a reduction to our investment in dow corning and a decrease to stockholders’ equity of 94 million after tax 

refer to note 13 employee retirement plans to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we have traditionally contributed to the us qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the irs minimum requirements and as a result mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until at least 2008 for 2006 we did not make any contributions to our pension plans for 2005 we issued and contributed 10 million shares of corning common stock with a value of approximately 199 million to our domestic pension plan we anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of approximately 100 million to our domestic and international pension plans in 2007 

environment 

we have been named by the environmental protection agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially responsible party for 18 active hazardous waste sites under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site identified by such agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is our policy to accrue for the estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by us based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants at december 31 2006 and 2005 we had accrued approximately 16 million undiscounted and 13 million undiscounted respectively for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation based upon the information developed to date we believe that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates that required us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments follow 

impairment of goodwill 

sfas 142 requires us to make certain difficult subjective and complex judgments on a number of matters including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units 

our annual goodwill recoverability assessment is completed in the fourth quarter as it is traditionally based on our annual strategic planning process that runs from june to october this process includes reviewing expectations for the longterm growth of our businesses and forecasting future cash flows we measure fair value on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows our estimates are based upon our historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends 

telecommunications 

results for the telecommunications segment in 2006 were moderate as pricing in the telecommunications industry continues to decline we expect the worldwide telecommunications industry market to remain stable fiber volumes to increase modestly and pricing pressures to continue 

the results of our impairment tests in 2006 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value a discount rate of 13 was used in both 2005 to 2006 our conclusion would not have changed had we used a discount rate of 125 or 135 

specialty materials 

the results of our impairment tests in 2006 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value a discount rate of 12 was used in 2006 and 13 was used in 2005 we determined a range of discount rates between 115 and 135 would not have affected our conclusion 

impairment of assets held for use 

sfas 144 requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets when an event of impairment has occurred we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in certain circumstances we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

once it has been determined that an impairment has occurred an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the impaired assets to be held and used this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and terminal values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 

restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions 

sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” requires us to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including for example employee termination costs restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses of portions thereof their profitability cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome the judgment involved can be difficult subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses 

restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which as a result require impairment in accordance with sfas 144 sfas 144 requires us to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned 

during 2004 we recorded writedowns of property plant and equipment as a result of decisions to exit facilities primarily in the telecommunications segment assets impaired were primarily equipment construction in progress and buildings which were sold or abandoned we used information available from recent auctions of telecommunications equipment to estimate salvage value when measuring impairment the estimated salvage values were very low primarily due to the depressed market for telecommunications related equipment the salvage values of property impaired were also estimated to be minimal as certain facilities will be abandoned and not sold it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to reserves 

valuation allowances for deferred income taxes 

sfas 109 “accounting for income taxes” requires us to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results and the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances if we sustain an appropriate level of profitability primarily in the us and germany or if we are able to develop tax planning strategies adjustments to current allowances will be required and may affect future net income refer to note 7 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 

probability of litigation outcomes 

sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” sfas 5 requires us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter case law and other casespecific issues see legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face the most significant matter involving judgment is the pcc asbestos liability there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability including the inherent complexity of a chapter 11 filing our history of success in defending asbestos claims our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants’ representatives we have reached a tentative plan of settlement on pcc as disclosed in legal proceedings and note 8 investments to the consolidated financial statements the settlement is subject to a number of contingencies including approval by the bankruptcy court and resolution of any appeals on december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court denied confirmation of the pcc plan of reorganization due to the scope of the channeling injunction proposed of the two shareholders with respect to other asbestos claims not deriving directly from pcc’s products or operations several parties including corning have moved for reconsideration of the ruling we continue to exercise judgment in assessing the likelihood that reconsideration will lead to a revised ruling or that an alternative plan of reorganization will emerge to address the claim deriving from pcc it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 

other possible liabilities 

sfas 5 and other similarly focused accounting literature require us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters including certain tax planning matters and environmental matters these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 

pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb 

pension and opeb costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates benefits earned interest cost expected return on plan assets mortality rates and other factors in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 

as of december 31 2006 the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was 2237 million 

the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans 

 the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning’s funding requirements 

in addition at december 31 2006 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders’ equity by 85 million before tax a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders’ equity by 84 million in addition the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to corning’s us opeb plans 

 the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

revenue recognition 

in certain instances revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns allowances discounts and other factors these estimates are supported by historical data while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning’s future results 

stock compensation 

stock based compensation expense and disclosures are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts these assumptions include riskfree discount rates expected term of the stock based compensation instrument granted volatility of stock and option prices expected time between grant date and date of exercise attrition performance and other factors these assumptions require us to exercise judgment our estimates of these assumptions typically are based upon our historical experience and currently available market place data while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning’s future stock based compensation expense and disclosures

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates our exposure to exchange rates have the following effects 

exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings and exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar which impact our net equity our most significant foreign currency exposure is the japanese yen and to a much lesser extent the korean won the taiwan dollar and the euro we selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 15 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases these hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or corning enter into lending situations generally on an intercompany basis denominated in currencies other than their local currency we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes corning uses derivative instruments forwards to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and as such are referred to as undesignated hedges changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities are recorded in current period earnings in the other income net component in the consolidated statement of operations 

equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations equity in earnings of affiliated companies net of impairments was 960 million in 2006 and 611 million in 2005 with foreignbased affiliates comprising over 65 of this amount in 2006 equity earnings from samsung corning and samsung corning precision totaled 555 million for 2006 and 296 million for 2005 exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies 

we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2006 we had open forward contracts open option contracts and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements all of which were designated as hedges at december 31 2006 a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 113 million specific to the japanese yen a 10 adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 39 million 

as we derive approximately 70 of our net sales from outside the us our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies most notably the japanese yen and euro our outlooks included in management’s discussion and analysis assume exchange rates during 2007 remain constant at january 2007 levels a plus or minus 10 point movement in the us dollar  japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2006 net sales of approximately 200 million and net income of approximately 140 million a plus or minus 10 point movement in the us dollar  euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2006 net sales of approximately 60 million but would have a negligible effect on net income 

interest rate risk management 

it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates our policy prescribes that total variable rate debt will not exceed 35 of the total debt portfolio at anytime at december 31 2006 our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than 1 of variable rate instruments

based upon pwc’s disclosure corning evaluated pwc’s nonaudit services provided to corning during the relevant time periods and did not identify any additional nonaudit services that may have compromised pwc’s independence for purposes herein corning and pwc continue to evaluate and review processes relevant to the maintenance of pwc’s independence 

at that time pwc concluded that its objectivity and impartiality were unaffected by those services and therefore its independence had not been impaired this conclusion was based upon the nature of services and the fact that none of its personnel who were involved in providing the tax services or remitting amounts on corning’s behalf performed any audit or auditrelated services for corning the audit committee discussed with pwc its independence from corning and concurred with pwc’s assessment 

in january 2007 pwc issued its annual independence standards board standard no 1 independence letter to the audit committee of our board of directors and therein reported that it is independent under applicable standards in connection with its audit opinion for the financial statements contained in this report the audit committee has discussed with pwc its independence from corning and concurred with pwc

raw materials

cornings  production  of specialty  glasses  ceramics  and related  materials
requires  significant  quantities of energy  certain precious metals and batch
materials

although energy shortages have not been a problem  recently  the cost of energy
has increased  corning has achieved  flexibility through important  engineering
changes  to take  advantage  of  lowcost  energy  sources  in most  significant
processes specifically many of cornings principal manufacturing processes can
now be operated with natural gas propane oil or electricity  or a combination
of these energy sources

as to resources ores minerals  polymers and processed chemicals required in
manufacturing  operations   availability  appears  to  be  adequate  cornings
suppliers  from time to time may  experience  capacity  limitations in their own
operations  or may  eliminate  certain  product  lines  nevertheless  corning
believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch chemicals
and raw materials  for many products  corning has alternate glass compositions
that would allow  operations to continue  without  interruption  in the event of
specific materials shortages

certain key materials and  proprietary  equipment used in the  manufacturing  of
products are currently  sole sourced or available  only from a limited number of
suppliers  any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of
components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments  or reduce
cornings gross margins

state federal and foreign pollutioncontrol  regulations this program resulted
in capital and operating expenditures during the past several years in order to
maintain  compliance with such regulations  capital  expenditures for pollution
control in continuing  operations were approximately 19 million in 2005 and are
estimated to be 26 million in 2006

item 1a  risk factors


set forth below are some of the  principal  risks and  uncertainties  that could
cause our actual business results to differ materially from any  forwardlooking
statements contained in this report future results could be materially affected
by general industry and market conditions  changes in laws or accounting rules
general economic and political conditions including a global economic slowdown
fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates  terrorism  political
unrest  or  international  conflicts  political  instability  or  major  health
concerns   natural   disasters  or  other   disruptions  of  expected  business
conditions  these  risk  factors  should  be  considered  in  addition  to  our
cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this annual report

our  sales  could be  negatively  impacted  if one or more of our key  customers
substantially reduce orders for our products

     cornings  ten  largest  customers  account  for  about  50 of our  sales
however  no  individual  customer  accounts  for more than 10 of  consolidated
sales

     a relatively  small number of customers  accounted for a high percentage of
net sales in each of our reportable operating segments for 2005 five customers
of the display technologies  segment  each of which accounted for more than 10
of  segment  net  sales  accounted  for  75 of  total  segment  sales  in the
telecommunications segment two customers each of which accounted for more than
10 of this  segments  net sales  accounted  for 29 of total segment sales in
2005 in the environmental  technologies segment three customers each of which
accounted for more than 10 of segment sales  represented  76 of total segment
sales for 2005 in the life sciences segment one distributor  accounted for 53
of this segments sales in 2005

     samsung  corning  precisions  sales  were also  concentrated  with  three
customers accounting for 98 of sales in 2005

     although the sale of lcd glass  substrates has increased in 2005 there can
be no assurance that this positive  trend will  continue  our customers are lcd
panel and color filter makers  as they switch to larger size glass the pace of
their orders may be uneven while they adjust their  manufacturing  processes and
facilities  additionally  consumer  preferences for panels of differing sizes
price or other factors  may lead to pauses in market growth from time to time
our  customers  may not be able to  maintain  profitable  operations  or  access
sufficient  capital to fund  ongoing and future  planned  expansions  which may
limit their pace of orders to us emerging  technologies could replace our glass
substrates for certain applications resulting in a decline in demand for our lcd
products

     our  telecommunications  segment  customers  purchases of our products are
affected  by  their  capital  expansion  plans   general  market  and  economic
uncertainty and regulatory  changes  including  broadband policy  sales in the
telecommunications  segment are expected to be impacted by verizon communication
inc verizon fibertothepremises deployments our sales will be dependent on
verizons  planned targets for homes passed and connected  changes in verizons
deployment plan could adversely affect future sales

     in the environmental  technologies segment  sales of our ceramic substrate
and filter  products for automotive and diesel  emissions and pollution  control
are expected to fluctuate with vehicle production  changes in governmental laws
and regulations for air quality and emission  controls may also influence future
sales  sales in our environmental  technologies  segment are to four catalyzers
and emission system component manufacturers our customers sell these systems to
automotive original equipment manufacturers and diesel engine manufacturers

     sales in our life  science  segment  were  historically  through  two large
distributors to government entities pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
hospitals  universities and other research facilities  during 2005 we did not
renew the contract with one large distributor and transitioned the sales through
this  distributor to our remaining  primary  distributor  and other existing and
developing channels  this change has and may continue to adversely impact sales
volumes in the short term in 2005 our remaining primary distributor  accounted
for 53 of total segment sales

if the  markets for our  products  do not  develop and expand as we  anticipate
demand for our products may decline  which would negatively  impact our results
of operations and financial performance

     the  markets  for  our  products  are  characterized  by  rapidly  changing
technologies evolving industry or government standards and frequent new product
introductions  our success is expected to depend  in substantial  part on the
successful  introduction of new products  or upgrades of current products  and
our ability to compete with new  technologies  and products of other  suppliers
the  following  factors  related to our products and markets  if not  achieved
could have an adverse impact on our results of operations

    our ability to introduce  leading  products  such as glass  substrates  for
     liquid  crystal  displays   optical  fiber  and  cable  and  hardware  and
     equipment   and   environmental   substrate   products  that  can  command
     competitive prices in the marketplace
    our ability to achieve a favorable sales mix of large  generation  sizes of
     liquid crystal display glass
    our ability to develop new products in response to  government  regulations
     and  laws   particularly  diesel  filter  products  in  the  environmental
     technologies segment
    continued strong demand for notebook computers and lcd monitors
    the rate of  growth  in  purchases  of lcd  televisions  to  replace  other
     technologies and
    the rate of growth of the fibertothepremises buildout in north america

we face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely
affect our results of operations and financial performance

     we face pricing  pressure in each of our leading  businesses as a result of
intense competition emerging new technologies or overcapacity  while we will
work toward reducing our costs to offset pricing  pressures  we may not be able
to achieve proportionate reductions in costs as a result of overcapacity in the
telecommunications  segment  we anticipate pricing pressures will continue into
2006  and  beyond  increased  pricing  pressure  may  develop  in  our  display
technologies  segment as our competitors  strive to expand  production of larger
generation substrates

we face risks related to our international operations and sales

     we have customers and significant  operations  including manufacturing and
sales  located  outside the us  we have large  manufacturing  operations  for
liquid crystal display glass substrates in taiwan and the  asiapacific  region
including  equity  investments  in companies  operating in south korea that make
glass  substrates for the lcd market  all of our display segment  customers are
located in the asiapacific region as a result of these and other international
operations we face a number of risks including

    geographical concentration of our factories and operations
    major health concerns
    difficulty of managing global operations
    difficulty in protecting intellectual property
    tariffs duties and other trade barriers including antidumping duties
    undeveloped legal systems
    political and economic instability in foreign markets and
    foreign currency risk

     any of these  items  could  cause  our  sales  andor  profitability  to be
significantly reduced

we face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations

     because we have  significant  customers  and  operations  outside the us
fluctuations in foreign currencies  especially the japanese yen the new taiwan
dollar  the korean  won  and the euro  affect  our sales and  profit  levels
foreign exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where
local currencies decline in value relative to the dollar and japanese yen sales
in our display  technologies  segment  representing 38 of cornings sales are
denominated   in  japanese  yen  the  expected  sales  growth  of  the  display
technologies  segment  will  increase  our  exposure to  currency  fluctuations
although we hedge significant  transaction and balance sheet currency exposures
we do not hedge  translation risk and thus changes in exchange rates especially
the  yen  may  significantly  impact  our  reported  revenues  and  results  of
operations

if the  financial  condition of our customers  declines  our credit risks could
increase

     although we have a rigorous  process to  administer  credit and believe our
reserve is  adequate  we have  experienced  and in the future may  experience
losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts  receivable  if our
customers fail to meet their payment  obligations to us including  deposits due
under  longterm  purchase  and supply  agreements  in our display  technologies
segment  we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amounts
reserved  some  customers  of  our  display  technologies  segment  are  thinly
capitalized andor marginally profitable in our environmental products segment
the us auto customers and certain of their suppliers have  encountered  credit
downgrades or in the case of delphi corporation  bankruptcy these factors may
result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business as
of december 31 2005 reserves for trade receivables  totaled  approximately 24
million

if we do not  successfully  adjust  our  manufacturing  volumes  and fixed  cost
structure  or achieve  manufacturing  yields or sufficient product reliability
our operating results could suffer and we may not achieve  profitability levels
anticipated

     we are investing  heavily in additional  manufacturing  capacity of certain
businesses  principally  including  liquid  crystal  display  glass and  diesel
emission  substrates and filters  the speed of constructing  the new facilities
presents  challenges  we may face  technical  and  process  issues in moving to
commercial  production  there can be no assurance  that corning will be able to
pace  its  capacity  expansion  to  the  actual  demand  it  is  possible  that
manufacturing capacity may exceed customer demand during certain periods

     the  manufacturing  of our  products  involves  highly  complex and precise
processes requiring production in highly controlled and dustfree environments
changes  in  our  manufacturing   processes  could   significantly   reduce  our
manufacturing   yields  and  product  reliability   in  some  cases   existing
manufacturing  may be  insufficient to achieve the volume or requirements of our
customers we will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to
achieve  targeted  volume  pricing and cost levels that will permit  profitable
operations  while we  continue to fund  projects  to improve our  manufacturing
techniques and  processes  we may not achieve  satisfactory  cost levels in our
manufacturing activities that will fully satisfy our margin targets

our future  operating  results  depend on our ability to  purchase a  sufficient
amount of materials  parts and manufacturing  equipment components to meet the
demands of our customers

     our ability to meet  customer  demand  depends  in part on our ability to
obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials  parts and components from our
suppliers   we  may  experience  shortages  that  could  adversely  affect  our
operations  although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid these types of
shortages  there can be no assurances that we will not encounter these problems
in  the  future  furthermore  certain  of  our  components  and  manufacturing
equipment are available only from a single source or limited sources we may not
be  able  to  find  alternate  sources  in  a  timely  manner  a  reduction  or
interruption  in supplies  or a  significant  increase in the price of supplies
could have a material adverse effect on our businesses

we have incurred and may in the future incur  restructuring and other charges
the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately

     we have recorded several charges for  restructuring  impairment of assets
and the  writeoff of cost and equity based  investments  it is possible we may
record  additional  charges  for  restructuring  or other asset  impairments  if
additional  actions become necessary to align costs to a reduced level of demand
or other factors impacting our businesses

we have  incurred  and may in the future incur  goodwill and other  intangible
asset impairment charges

     at december 31 2005  corning had goodwill and other intangible  assets of
338 million  while we believe the  estimates  and judgments  about future cash
flows used in the goodwill  impairment  tests are reasonable  we cannot provide
assurance  that future  impairment  charges will not be required if the expected
cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur

we may be limited in our ability to obtain  additional  capital on  commercially
reasonable terms

     although we believe  existing cash  shortterm  investments  and borrowing
capacity  collectively  provide adequate  resources to fund ongoing  operating
requirements  we may be  required  to  seek  additional  financing  to  compete
effectively in our markets  our public debt ratings affect our ability to raise
capital and the cost of such  capital  our ratings as of february 17 2006 were
bbb from both fitch  inc and standard  poors a division of the mcgrawhill
companies inc and baa3 from moodys investors service a subsidiary of moodys
corporation  any  downgrades  may increase our  borrowing  costs and affect our
ability to access the capital markets

     we are subject under our revolving  credit facility to financial  covenants
that  require us to  maintain  two ratios  including  total debt to capital  and
interest  coverage  as  defined  under the  revolving  credit  facility  these
covenants  limit our  ability  to borrow  funds  future  losses or  significant
charges would materially affect these ratios  and may reduce the amounts we are
able to borrow under our revolving credit facility

if our products or materials purchased from our suppliers experience performance
issues our business will suffer

     our business  depends on the  production of products of  consistently  high
quality  our products  components and materials  purchased from our suppliers
are  typically  tested for  quality  these  testing  procedures  are limited to
evaluating  our products under likely and  foreseeable  failure  scenarios  for
various reasons our products including materials purchased from our suppliers
may fail to perform as expected  in some cases product redesigns or additional
expense may be required to correct a defect  a significant or systemic  product
failure could result in customer relations  problems  lost sales and financial
damages

we face competition in most of our businesses

     we  expect  that  we  will  face  additional   competition   from  existing
competitors low cost manufacturers and new entrants we must invest in research
and   development   expand  our   engineering   manufacturing   and  marketing
capabilities  and continue to improve  customer service and support in order to
remain competitive we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain
or improve our competitive position

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and
we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual  property rights
of others

     we may encounter  difficulties  in  protecting  our  intellectual  property
rights or obtaining  rights to  additional  intellectual  property  necessary to
permit us to continue or expand our  businesses  we cannot  assure you that the
patents that we hold or may obtain will provide  meaningful  protection  against
our  competitors  litigation  may be  necessary  to  enforce  our  intellectual
property  rights  litigation is  inherently  uncertain and the outcome is often
unpredictable  other  companies  hold  patents  on  technologies  used  in  our
industries  and are  aggressively  seeking to expand  enforce and license their
patent portfolios

     the  intellectual  property  rights of others could  inhibit our ability to
introduce new products  we are and may in the future be  subject to claims of
intellectual  property  infringement or misappropriation that may result in loss
of revenue  require us to incur substantial  costs or lead to monetary damages
or injunctive  relief against us we cannot assure you as to the outcome of such
claims

current or future  litigation  may harm our  financial  condition  or results of
operations

     pending   threatened   or  future   litigation   is  subject  to  inherent
uncertainties our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely
affected by unfavorable outcomes expenses and costs exceeding amounts estimated
or  insured  in  particular  we have been  named as a  defendant  in  numerous
lawsuits  alleging  personal  injury from exposure to asbestos  as described in
legal  proceedings  our  negotiations  with  the  representatives  of  asbestos
claimants  have  produced  a  tentative   settlement   through  a  pcc  plan  of
reorganization  but certain cases may still be litigated the final approval of
the tentative settlement is subject to a number of uncertainties final approval
of a global settlement through the pcc bankruptcy process may impact the results
of operations for the period in which such costs if any are recognized  total
charges of 643 million have been incurred through  december 31 2005  however
additional charges are possible due to the potential fluctuation in the price of
our common  stock  other  adjustments  in the  proposed  settlement  and other
litigation factors

we face risks through our equity method  investments in companies that we do not
control

     cornings net income includes  significant equity in earnings of associated
companies  for the year ended december 31 2005 we recognized  598 million of
equity  earnings  of which 661 million came from our two largest  investments
dow corning  corporation  which makes  silicone  products and samsung  corning
precision glass co ltd  which makes liquid crystal  display glass  samsung
corning precision glass co ltd samsung corning  precision is located in the
asiapacific  region and is  subject to  political  geographic  risks  mentioned
above our equity  investments may not continue to perform at the same levels as
in recent  years  in the third  quarter of 2005  we  recognized  equity losses
associated with samsung corning co ltd our 50 equity method investment that
makes glass panels and funnels for  conventional  televisions  which  recorded
significant  fixed  asset  and other  impairment  charges  as the  conventional
television market will be negatively  impacted by strong growth in the lcd glass
market  it is  reasonably  possible  that samsung  corning co  ltd may incur
additional  restructuring  or impairment  charges or net operating losses in the
future

we may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us

     we face the risk of loss  resulting  from  product  liability  securities
fiduciary liability  intellectual property antitrust  contractual  warranty
fraud and other lawsuits whether or not such claims are valid in addition our
product  liability   fiduciary   directors  and  officers  property  natural
catastrophe and comprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate to
cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect our insurance
costs  have  increased  and  may  increase  further  we may  not be able to get
adequate  insurance  coverage in the future at  acceptable  costs  a successful
claim that  exceeds or is not covered by our  policies  could  require us to pay
substantial  sums some of the carriers in our excess insurance  programs are in
liquidation  and may not be able to respond if we should  have  claims  reaching
into excess layers  the financial health of other insurers may deteriorate  in
addition  we may not be able to obtain adequate  insurance coverage for certain
risk such as political risk terrorism or war

item 3  legal proceedings


environmental litigation corning has been named by the environmental protection
agency the  agency  under the  superfund  act or by state  governments  under
similar state laws as a potentially  responsible  party at 11 active  hazardous
waste sites  under the superfund act all parties who may have  contributed any
waste to a hazardous  waste site  identified  by such  agency  are jointly and
severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise  it
is cornings policy to accrue for its estimated  liability  related to superfund
sites and other  environmental  liabilities related to property owned by corning
based on expert analysis and continual  monitoring by both internal and external
consultants  corning has accrued 13 million  undiscounted  for its estimated
liability for  environmental  cleanup and litigation at december 31 2005 based
upon the  information  developed to date  management  believes that the accrued
reserve is a reasonable estimate of the companys liability and that the risk of
an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote

dow corning bankruptcy corning and the dow chemical company dow chemical each
own 50 of the common stock of dow corning corporation dow corning  which was
in  reorganization  proceedings  under  chapter 11 of the us  bankruptcy  code
between may 1995 and june 2004 dow corning filed for  bankruptcy  protection to
address   pending   and  claimed   liabilities   arising   from  many   thousand
breastimplant  product  lawsuits  on june 1 2004  dow corning  emerged  from
chapter 11 with a plan of  reorganization  the  plan  which  provided  for the
settlement  or other  resolution  of implant  claims and  includes  releases for
corning and dow chemical as  shareholders in exchange for  contributions  to the
plan

under  the terms of the plan  dow  corning  has  established  and is  funding a
settlement trust and a litigation facility to provide a means for tort claimants
to settle or litigate  their  claims  dow corning has paid  approximately  16
billion inclusive of insurance to the settlement trust and subject to a number
of conditions may pay up to an additional 16 billion 710 million aftertax
over 16 years  certain commercial creditors continue to pursue an appeal to the
us  court  of  appeals  of the  sixth  circuit  seeking  from dow  corning  an
additional  sum of  approximately  80 million for interest at default rates and
enforcement  costs the appeal was argued on july 27 2005 corning believes the
risk of loss to dow corning net of amounts reserved is remote

in addition  dow corning has received a statutory notice of deficiency from the
united states  internal  revenue  service  asserting tax  deficiencies  totaling
approximately  65 million  relating  to its federal  income tax returns for the
1995 and 1996 calendar  years  this matter is pending before the us  district
court in michigan  dow corning has also received a proposed adjustment from the
irs approximately  117 million with respect to its federal income tax returns
for the 1997 1998 and 1999 calendar years dow corning is vigorously contesting
these deficiencies and proposed adjustments which it believes are excessive

in 1995  corning  fully  impaired its  investment in dow corning upon its entry
into  bankruptcy  proceedings and did not recognize net equity earnings from the
second quarter of 1995 through the end of 2002 corning began recognizing equity
earnings  in the  first  quarter  of 2003  when  management  concluded  that its
emergence  from  bankruptcy  protection  was  probable  corning  considers  the
difference  between the carrying  value of its investment in dow corning and its
50 share of dow  cornings  equity to be  permanent  this  difference  is 249
million subject to future rulings by the bankruptcy court and potential changes
in estimated bankruptcyrelated liabilities it is possible that dow corning may
record bankruptcyrelated charges in the future corning received 45 million in
dividends from dow corning in 2005

pittsburgh corning corporation  corning and ppg industries inc ppg each own
50 of the capital stock of pittsburgh corning  corporation pcc over a period
of more than two decades  pcc and several other  defendants  have been named in
numerous  lawsuits  involving  claims alleging  personal injury from exposure to
asbestos on april 16 2000 pcc filed for chapter 11 reorganization in the us
bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania  as of the bankruptcy
filing pcc had in excess of 140000 open claims and had insufficient  remaining
insurance  and assets to deal with its alleged  current and future  liabilities
more  than  100000  additional  claims  have  been  filed  with pcc  after  its
bankruptcy filing as a result of pccs bankruptcy  filing  corning recorded an
aftertax  charge of 36 million in 2001 to fully impair its  investment  in pcc
and  discontinued  recognition  of  equity  earnings  at the time pcc filed for
bankruptcy  protection  there were approximately  12400 claims pending against
corning in state court lawsuits  alleging various theories of liability based on
exposure to pccs asbestos products and typically requesting monetary damages in
excess of one million  dollars per claim  corning has defended  those claims on
the basis of the separate  corporate  status of pcc and the absence of any facts
supporting  claims of direct  liability  arising from pccs  asbestos  products
corning  is  also   currently   named  in   approximately   11000  other  cases
approximately  43500  claims  alleging  injuries  from  asbestos  and similar
amounts  of  monetary  damages  per  claim  those  cases  have been  covered by
insurance  without  material impact to corning to date  asbestos  litigation is
inherently  difficult  and past  trends in  resolving  these  claims may not be
indicators of future outcomes

in the  bankruptcy  court in april 2000  pcc obtained a preliminary  injunction
against the prosecution of asbestos  actions arising from pccs products against
its two  shareholders  to  afford  the  parties  a  period  of time in  which to
negotiate a plan of reorganization for pcc the pcc plan

on may 14 2002  ppg announced that it had agreed with certain of its insurance
carriers and  representatives  of current and future  asbestos  claimants on the
terms of a  settlement  arrangement  applicable  to claims  arising  from  pccs
products

on march 28 2003  corning  announced  that it had also reached  agreement with
representatives  of  current  and  future  asbestos  claimants  on a  settlement
arrangement that was thereafter  incorporated into the pcc plan this settlement
remains  subject  to a  number  of  contingencies  including  approval  by  the
bankruptcy court  cornings  settlement will require the  contribution  if the
plan is  approved  and becomes  effective  of its equity  interest in pcc  its
onehalf  equity  interest in pittsburgh  corning  europe pce  and 25 million
shares of corning  common stock  the settlement  also requires  corning to make
cash payments of 152 million net present value as of december 31 2005 in six
installments  beginning  one year  after  the plan is  effective  in  addition
corning will assign policy rights or proceeds under primary  insurance from 1962
through 1984 as well as rights to proceeds under certain excess insurance most
of which falls  within the period from 1962  through  1973  in return for these
contributions corning expects to receive a release and an injunction channeling
asbestos claims against it into a settlement trust under the pcc plan

corning  recorded an initial  charge of 298 million in the period  ending march
31 2003 to reflect the settlement terms  however the amount of the charge for
this  settlement  requires  adjustment  each  quarter  based  upon the change in
cornings  common stock price prior to  contribution of the shares to the trust
during the fourth  quarter of 2005  corning  recorded a charge of 8 million to
reflect the  marktomarket  of corning  common stock  beginning with the first
quarter of 2003 and  through  december  31  2005  corning  recorded  total net
charges  of 643  million to  reflect  the  initial  settlement  and  subsequent
marktomarket adjustments for the change in the value of corning common stock

two of cornings  primary  insurers and several  excess  insurers have commenced
litigation for a declaration of the rights and  obligations of the parties under
insurance  policies  including  rights that may be  affected by the  settlement
arrangement  described  above  corning is  vigorously  contesting  these cases
management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation

the pcc plan received a favorable vote from creditors in march 2004 hearings to
consider  objections to the plan were held in the bankruptcy  court in may 2004
the  parties  filed  posthearing  briefs and made final oral  arguments  to the
bankruptcy  court in november 2004  the bankruptcy  court allowed an additional
round of briefing to address current case law  developments and heard additional
oral  arguments on march 16 2005 in midapril  2005 the proponents of the pcc
plan requested that the court rule on the pending objections  if the bankruptcy
court does not approve the pcc plan in its current form changes to the plan are
probable  as it is likely  that the court  will  allow  the  proponents  time to
propose  amendments   the  outcome  of  these  proceedings  is  uncertain  and
confirmation  of the current  plan or any amended plan is subject to a number of
contingencies  however apart from the quarterly  marktomarket  adjustment in
the value of the 25 million  shares of corning stock  management  believes that
the likelihood of a material adverse impact to cornings financial statements is
remote

item 7 managements  discussion and analysis of financial condition and results

of operations


overview

we  continued  to focus on three  significant  priorities  in 2005  protect our
financial  health  improve  profitability  and invest in our  future  we made
significant progress on all three in 2005

financial health

during 2005 we strengthened our balance sheet and delivered positive cash flows
from operating activities the following are key accomplishments for 2005

    as part of a debt  reduction  program  we  reduced  the net  amount of our
     outstanding  debt by 885 million  through a combination of retirements and
     scheduled repayments
    all three rating agencies upgraded our ratings to investment grade
    we  received  457  million in  deposits  against  orders  relating  to our
     multiyear  supply  agreements  with customers in the display  technologies
     segment  these  agreements  have helped us to meet the rapid growth of the
     liquid crystal display lcd market
    we generated  sufficient cash flows from operating  activities to cover our
     capital expenditures

we ended  2005  with 24  billion  in cash  cash  equivalents  and  shortterm
investments this represents an increase of 553 million from december 31 2004
in the first quarter of 2005 we entered into a new  revolving  credit  facility
with a group of banks  this  facility  which  continues  through  march  2010
provides us access to a 975 million unsecured  multicurrency revolving line of
credit  we believe we have  sufficient  liquidity for the next several years to
fund operations capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments

profitability

for the year ended december 31 2005 we generated net income of 585 million or
038 per share  compared to a net loss of 2165 million or 156 per share for
2004

we recorded restructuring impairment and other charges and credits in 2005 and
2004  which  affect  the   comparability  of  those  years   refer  to  note  3
restructuring  impairment  and other  charges and  credits  note 6 income
taxes  and note 7 investments to the consolidated  financial  statements for
additional information

investing in our future

we remain  committed to investing in research  development  and engineering to
drive  innovation  we are  investing in a wide variety of  technologies  with a
focus on glass substrates for active matrix lcds  diesel filters and substrates
in response to tightening emissions control standards and the optical fiber and
cable and hardware and equipment that will enable fibertothepremises

our research  development  and engineering  expenditures  have increased by 88
million or 25 compared to 2004 we believe our spending  levels are adequate to
support our growth strategies

we also  remain  committed  to  investing  in  manufacturing  capacity  to match
increased  demand in our  businesses  our capital  expenditures  are  primarily
focused on  expanding  manufacturing  capacity for lcd glass  substrates  in the
display   technologies   segment  and  diesel  products  in  the   environmental
technologies  segment  total capital expenditures for 2005 were 1553 million
of which 1250 million was directed toward our display technologies segment and
171 million was invested in our environmental technologies segment primarily in
anticipation of the emerging market for diesel emission control systems

we expect our 2006  capital  spending to be in the range of 13 billion to 15
billion  of which 900  million to 11  billion  will be  directed  toward our
display  technologies  segment and  approximately  200 million will be directed
toward our environmental technologies segment

net sales

the net sales  increase  in 2005 was the  result of a  significant  increase  in
demand for lcd glass substrates in our display  technologies  segment and modest
gains in demand  for  products  in our  telecommunications  segment  to  support
fibertothepremises  projects and our  environmental  segment due to increased
sales of diesel filters net sales for our life sciences segment declined due to
changes in the  distribution  channels  movements in foreign exchange rates did
not significantly impact the comparison of net sales between 2005 and 2004

the net  sales  increase  in 2004 was the  result  of  strong  demand  for glass
substrates  in  our  display  technologies  segment  demand  for  hardware  and
equipment products in our  telecommunications  segment  and improvements across
the majority of our other businesses  these  improvements were partially offset
by the 2003 exit of our photonic technologies and us  conventional  television
glass  businesses  movements in foreign exchange rates  did not  significantly
impact the comparison of net sales between 2004 and 2003

reflecting  the  growth in our  display  technologies  segment  net sales  into
international  markets continue to increase at a faster rate than those into the
us  market  for  2005  2004  and 2003  sales  into  international  markets
accounted for 71 65 and 60 of net sales respectively

gross margin

as a percentage of net sales  gross margin improved 6 percentage points in 2005
when compared to 2004 the  improvement in overall gross margin dollars and as a
percentage  of net sales was driven by increased  volume  improved mix of large
generation  glass and  manufacturing  efficiencies in our display  technologies
segment

for 2004 as a percentage of net sales  gross margin  improved by 10 percentage
points  versus  2003  the  improvement  was  driven by net sales  growth in the
display   technologies   segment   of  87   operating   efficiencies   in  our
telecommunications  segment  and the 2003 exit of the  conventional  television
glass business

     impairment of goodwill
     

     2004 impairment charge

     pursuant to sfas no 142  goodwill and other  intangible  assets  sfas
     142  goodwill  is  required  to be tested for  impairment  annually at the
     reporting unit level in addition goodwill should be tested for impairment
     between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances  change that would
     more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting  unit below its
     related carrying value in the third quarter of 2004 we identified certain
     factors  that  caused us to lower our  estimates  and  projections  for the
     longterm revenue growth of the telecommunications segment which indicated
     that the fair value of the  telecommunications  segment  reporting unit was
     less than its carrying  value  we performed an interim  impairment test of
     the  telecommunications  segment goodwill in the third quarter of 2004 and
     as a result  recorded an impairment charge of 1420 million to reduce the
     carrying  value of goodwill to its implied fair value at september 30 2004
     of 117 million

     impairment of longlived assets other than goodwill
     

     given our restructuring actions and the market conditions facing certain of
     our  businesses  at various  times  throughout  2003 to 2005 we performed
     evaluations of the  recoverability  of our held for use  longlived  assets
     other  than  goodwill  when an  impairment  evaluation  was  required  we
     developed  expected future cash flows against which to compare the carrying
     value of the asset group being evaluated if our projections indicated that
     our long lived assets were not  recoverable  through future cash flows  we
     were then  required to estimate  the fair value of the  longlived  assets
     which were limited to  property  plant and  equipment  using the expected
     cash flow approach as a measure of fair value

     2005 impairment charge

     assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment

     in 2005 we recorded 6 million of charges  related to adjustments to prior

          charge  was  comprised  of the  partially  completed  sections  of our
          concord  nc  optical  fiber  facility  as a result of our  lowered
          outlook  we have permanently  abandoned this construction in progress
          as we no longer  believe the demand for optical fiber will warrant the
          investment necessary to complete this facility we have mothballed and

          of the concord fiber facility

          assets   previously   impaired   this   represented  the  substantial
          completion of the sale of cavs assets

     assets to be held and used

     due to our decision to  permanently  abandon  certain  assets and lower our
     longterm outlook for the telecommunications segment in 2004 we determined
     that an event of impairment had occurred in our telecommunications  segment
     which  required  us to test the  segments  longlived  assets  other  than
     goodwill for  impairment  as a result of this  impairment  evaluation  we
     recorded a 24 million  impairment  charge in the third  quarter of 2004 to

          impair plant and equipment  related to the shutdown of a cabling plant
          and the final exit of the photonic technologies  business the charges
          were more than  offset by a 61  million  credit  related to  previous
          restructuring plans  primarily the result of our decision not to exit
          two of the cable sites previously marked for shutdown in 2002

         other  businesses  we  recorded  charges  of 78  million  primarily
          related to our decision to shutdown  cav and the closure of our north

legal settlement  asbestos

on  march  28  2003  we  announced  that we had  reached  agreement  with  the
representatives  of  current  and  future  asbestos  claimants  on a  settlement
arrangement  that  was  thereafter  incorporated  into  the  pittsburgh  corning
corporation pcc plan of reorganization the pcc plan this settlement remains
subject  to a number of  contingencies  including  approval  by the  bankruptcy
court  if the pcc plan is approved and becomes  effective  our settlement will
require the  contribution  of our equity  interest in pcc our  onehalf  equity
interest in pittsburgh  corning europe nv pce  and 25 million shares of our
common stock the common stock will be  markedtomarket  each quarter until the
pcc plan is approved thus resulting in adjustments to income and the settlement
liability as  appropriate  corning will also make cash payments of 152 million
net present  value as of december 31 2005 in six  installments  beginning one
year after the plan is effective  in addition  we will assign insurance policy
proceeds  from our primary  insurance  and a portion of our excess  insurance as
part of the  settlement  two of cornings  primary  insurers and several excess
insurers  have  commenced  litigation  for  a  declaration  of  the  rights  and
obligations of the parties under insurance  policies  including rights that may
be affected by the settlement arrangement described above corning is vigorously
contesting  these  cases  management  is unable to predict  the outcome of this
insurance litigation

the pcc plan received a favorable vote from creditors in march 2004 hearings to
consider  objections  to the pcc plan were held in the  bankruptcy  court in may
2004  the parties  filed  posthearing  briefs and made oral  arguments  to the
bankruptcy  court in november 2004  the bankruptcy  court allowed an additional
round of briefing to address current case law  developments and heard additional
oral  arguments on march 16 2005 in midapril  2005 the proponents of the pcc
plan requested that the court rule on the pending objections  if the bankruptcy
court does not approve the pcc plan in its current form changes to the plan are
probable  as it is likely  that the court  will  allow  the  proponents  time to
propose  amendments   the  outcome  of  these  proceedings  is  uncertain  and
confirmation  of the current  plan or any amended plan is subject to a number of
contingencies  however apart from the quarterly  marktomarket  adjustment in
the value of the 25 million  shares of corning stock  management  believes that
the likelihood of a material adverse impact to cornings financial statements is
remote

the  following  summarizes  the  charges  we  have  recorded  for  the  asbestos
settlement in millions

income loss from continuing operations before income taxes

in  addition  to the  drivers  identified  under  gross  margin  restructuring
impairment  and other  charges and credits  and asbestos  settlement  we also
retired a significant amount of our outstanding debentures during 2005 2004 and
2003 that resulted in the following  losses gains for the  respective  periods
in millions

                                             2005           2004          2003

provision benefit for income taxes



our provision  benefit for income taxes and the related  effective  income tax
benefit rates were as follows in millions

                                                   for the years ended december 31
                                            
                                              2005               2004              2003

                                                                         
provision benefit for income taxes             578               1031           254
effective income tax benefit rate             1010                652          334



the  effective  income  tax  benefit  rate  for  2005  differed  from the us
statutory rate of 35 primarily due to an increase in income tax expense of 525
million  resulting  from an  increase  in  cornings  valuation  allowance  the
increase in the valuation  allowance was the result of our  conclusion  that the
sale of an appreciated asset was no longer prudent and as such no longer meets
the criteria in sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes sfas no 109 for a
viable tax planning  strategy  the difference  between the effective income tax
benefit rate for 2004 and the us  statutory rate of 35 was primarily due to
increases in the valuation  allowance  against certain  domestic us  federal
state  and  local  and  foreign  deferred  tax  assets  and the  writeoff  of
nondeductible goodwill


page



for 2005 the tax provision reflected the following items

    the impact of our inability to record tax benefits on net operating  losses
     generated in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions
    an increase in our valuation allowance of 525 million
    the benefit of a worthless stock deduction and a corresponding increase in
     our  valuation  allowance  for the loss on our  investment in the photonic
     technologies  business  associated with the pirelli  acquisition  which was
     completed  in december  2000 and was  substantially  impaired in the second
     quarter of 2001
    the  benefit  of tax  holidays  and  investment  credits  in taiwan and tax
     holidays in china and south africa
    the benefit from the reversal of tax contingency  liabilities following the
     conclusion of internal revenue service irs examinations and
    an 82  million  credit  primarily  for the tax effect of  eliminating  our
     minimum pension liability for the domestic qualified plan

in 2004 significant events occurred which required us to increase our valuation
allowances against certain us and german deferred tax assets  refer to note 3
restructuring  impairment  and other  charges and  credits  for  additional
information on these events and the related charges  accordingly  we increased
our  valuation  allowance by 12 billion in the third quarter of 2004 to reduce
our net deferred tax assets to  approximately  530  million  at that time  we
believed  that it was more likely than not that we could  realize the  remaining
net deferred tax assets  through a tax planning  strategy  involving the sale of
our investment in dow corning  corporation  dcc a  nonstrategic  appreciated
asset if we were faced with expiring net operating loss carryforwards

during 2005  dccs  performance was much stronger than expected and dcc resumed
paying a dividend  both of which are expected to continue in the future due to
this improved  performance  dcc now provides strong  financial  geographic and
market balance to cornings portfolio of businesses  the profitability of which
has  become  more  concentrated  due to the  success  of the  display  operating
segment  as a result we now consider dcc to be a strategic  investment and can
no longer  assert that a potential tax planning  strategy  involving the sale of
dcc would be prudent  as required by fas 109  therefore  we no longer believe
that it is more likely than not that we would realize the remaining net deferred
tax assets  accordingly  we have  increased  our  valuation  allowance by 525
million to fully reserve our net us  deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter
of 2005

we expect to  maintain a valuation  allowance  on future tax  benefits  until an
appropriate  level of  profitability  primarily  in the us  and  germany  is
sustained  or we are able to develop tax planning  strategies  that enable us to
conclude  that it is more  likely  than not that a portion of our  deferred  tax
assets would be realizable  until then our tax provision will include only the
net tax expense  attributable  to certain  foreign  operations  refer to note 6
income  taxes  to  the  consolidated   financial   statements  for  additional
information

during  the third  quarter of 2005  corning  filed its 2004  consolidated  us
federal  income tax  return  which  included  a 39  billion  worthless  stock
deduction for the loss on our investment in the photonic  technologies  business
associated  with the pirelli  acquisition  this  acquisition  was  completed in
december  2000 and was  substantially  impaired  in the second  quarter of 2001
prior to the third  quarter of 2005  we did not record a deferred tax asset for
this item as the ultimate  realization  of such  deduction  was  uncertain  and
consistent with the requirements of sfas no 5 accounting for  contingencies
recognition of an asset prior to the time management  determines the realization
of the asset is probable is  prohibited  on september 2 2005  corning and the
commissioner  of the irs entered into a closing  agreement under section 7121 of
the  internal  revenue code of 1986 which  provides  that corning is entitled to
this worthless stock  deduction  we recorded a 15 billion  deferred tax asset
for this item in the third quarter which was concurrently offset by a valuation
allowance of an equal amount due to our current inability to record tax benefits
for us net operating losses

certain  foreign  subsidiaries  in china  south  africa  korea and  taiwan are
operating  under  tax  holiday  arrangements  the  nature  and  extent  of such
arrangements  vary  and the benefits of such  arrangements  phase out in future
years  2006 to 2009  according  to the  specific  terms and  schedules  of the
relevant taxing  jurisdictions  the impact of the tax holidays on our effective
rate is a reduction  in the rate of 86  12  and 05 for 2005  2004  and
2003 respectively

the 2005 and 2004 increases in equity earnings of associated  companies  net of
impairments  are  primarily  due to strong  sales and earnings  performance  at
samsung  precision  our 50 owned south koreabased  manufacturer of lcd glass
and at dow corning our 50 owned us based manufacturer of silicone products

in addition to the above  equity in earnings of  associated  companies  net of
impairments  included the following  restructuring  and impairment  charges and
other credits

    in 2005 samsung corning incurred  impairment and other charges as a result
     of a decline in the  projected  operating  results for its cathode ray tube
     crt glass  business  the charge  which included  certain  manufacturing
     assets and severance and exit costs  reduced  cornings equity earnings by
     106  million  in the  third  quarter  as  samsung  corning  executes  its
     restructuring plan over the next several quarters additional severance and
     shutdown  costs may be  required  we expect our share of these  charges to
     approximate 30 million  none of the charges is expected to result in cash
     expenditures by corning
    in 2005 dow corning  recorded a gain on the issuance of subsidiary  stock
     our equity earnings included 11 million related to this gain
    in 2004 and 2003  corning  incurred charges of 35 million and 7 million
     respectively to impair equity method investments in the telecommunications
     segment to their estimated fair value
    in 2004 dow corning recorded charges related to restructuring  actions and
     adjustments  to  interest   liabilities  recorded  on  its  emergence  from
     bankruptcy  our equity  earnings  included  21  million  related to these
     charges
    in 2003 samsung corning co ltd recorded asset impairment  charges  our
     equity earnings included 66 million related to these charges

results of discontinued operations

in the  third  quarter  of  2004  corning  and 3m  reached  a final  settlement
agreement  for funds held in escrow  associated  with the 2002 sale of cornings
precision  lens  business to 3m as a result  we  recognized a 20 million gain
upon receipt of the proceeds in 2004

operating segments

our   reportable    operating    segments    include    display    technologies
telecommunications   environmental   technologies   and  life  sciences   the
environmental   technologies   reportable  segment  is  an  aggregation  of  our
automotive and diesel  operating  segments  as these two segments share similar
economic  characteristics  products  customer types  production processes and
distribution methods the following provides a brief description of the products
and markets served by each reportable segment

    display  technologies  manufactures  liquid crystal display glass for flat
     panel displays
    telecommunications  manufactures optical fiber and cable and hardware and
     equipment components for the worldwide telecommunications industry
    environmental  technologies  manufactures  ceramic  substrates and filters
     for automobile and diesel applications and
    life sciences  manufactures  glass and plastic  consumables for scientific
     applications

we prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is
consistent  with  the  manner  in  which we  internally  disaggregate  financial
information to assist in making  internal  operating  decisions  we include the
earnings of equity  affiliates  that are closely  associated  with our operating
segments in the  respective  segments  net income  we have  allocated  certain
common  expenses  among  segments  differently  than we  would  for  standalone
financial  information  prepared in accordance with gaap these expenses include
interest  taxes  and  corporate  functions  segment  net  income  may  not  be
consistent with measures used by other companies the accounting policies of our
reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated  financial
statements

on january 1 2006 corning changed its measurement of segment profit or loss as
follows
    we removed the net impact of financing  costs  such as interest expense on
     debt  instruments and interest costs  associated  with benefit plans  from
     reportable  segments and included  these  amounts in corporate  unallocated
     expense
    we changed  the  allocation  method for taxes to more  closely  reflect the
     companys current tax position
    we  removed  the  impact  of  noncash  stock  compensation   expense  from
     reportable  segments  and  included  this amount in  corporate  unallocated
     expense
    we  removed  the  allocation  of  exploratory  research   development  and
     engineering  expense from reportable segments and included these amounts in
     corporate unallocated expense
    we changed certain other allocation methods for corporate functions

the following  discussion  reflects segment information as reported for 2005 and
has not been restated to reflect the changes to segment performance  measurement
made  effective  january  1  2006  refer to note 19  subsequent  events  for

2005 vs 2004

the 2005 sales increase  reflects the continued  overall growth of the lcd glass
substrate market  during 2005 glass substrate volumes measured in square feet
of glass sold  increased  approximately  64  compared  with the same period in
2004 weighted average selling prices decreased 2 compared to 2004 included in
this weighted  average were selling price declines that were offset by increases
in the market demand for largesize glass  substrates  generation 5 and above
which carry a higher selling price per square foot for 2005  largesize  glass
substrates  accounted for 69 of total sales  volumes  compared to 46 in 2004
although sales of the display  technologies  segment are denominated in japanese
yen  movements in the us  dollar  japanese yen exchange  rate did not have a
significant impact on the comparability of sales

for 2005 the key drivers for the increase in income before equity earnings were
higher volumes ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies  and a lower
effective  tax  rate  movements  in  currency  exchange  rates  did not  have a
significant impact on income before equity earnings  the increase in our equity
earnings from samsung corning precision was largely driven by higher volumes and
ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies

the display technologies  segment has a concentrated  customer base comprised of
lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan and taiwan for the
year ended december 31 2005 au optronics corporation  chi mei optoelectronics
corporation  dai nippon  printing co ltd  sharp  corporation  and hannstar
display  corporation  each of which  accounted for more than 10 of segment net
sales  accounted for 75 of total segment sales  in addition  samsung corning
precisions  sales are concentrated  across a small number of its customers  in
2005 sales to three lcd panel makers located in korea samsung electronics co
ltd lg phillips lcd co and dong woo sti  accounted for 98 of total samsung
corning precision sales

in 2005 and 2004  corning and several customers entered into longterm purchase
and supply  agreements  in which the display  technologies  segment  will supply
largesize glass substrates to the customers over periods of up to six years as
part of the agreements  these customers agreed to make advance cash deposits to
corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased in 2005 and 2004
we received a total of 457 million and 204 million  respectively of deposits
against orders

in the event the customers do not make all customer deposit installment payments
or elect not to purchase  the agreed  upon  quantities  of  product  subject to
specific  conditions  outlined in the  agreements  corning  may retain  certain
amounts of the  customer  deposits  if corning  does not  deliver  agreed  upon
product  quantities  subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements
corning may be  required to return  certain  amounts of the  customer  deposits
refer to note 1 summary of significant  accounting policies and note 10 other
accrued  liabilities  to the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further
information


page



in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  corning  will  continue  to  negotiate
multiyear  supply  agreements  with its large  customers  where feasible but we
believe  it  is  unlikely  that  we  will  negotiate  agreements  which  require
additional deposits

corning is investing  heavily to expand capacity to meet  increasing  demand for
lcd  glass  substrates  in 2005  capital  spending  was 125  billion  and is
expected to be 900  million to 11 billion in 2006  capital  spending in 2006
will be used  mainly to  expand  manufacturing  facilities  in  tainan  taiwan
taichung taiwan and shizuoka japan

2004 vs 2003

the 2004 sales increase is largely  reflective of the overall lcdmarket growth
during 2004 glass substrate  volumes  increased  approximately  65 sales also
benefited from modest average price increases  primarily the result of a change
in product mix as the market trended toward large size glass sales benefited by
approximately  10 from a weakening of the us  dollar against the japanese yen
compared to 2003

for 2004 the key drivers for the increase in income before equity earnings were
the impact of incremental volumes and efficiencies realized through the shift in
production toward large size glass  substrates  the increase in equity earnings
were  driven  by the same  factors  as  those  identified  for our  whollyowned
business

outlook
we expect to see a  continuation  of the overall  industry  growth and the trend
toward  large  size  substrates  we  continue  to see  positive  trends  in the
penetration  rates  of lcd  glass  into  the  endmarkets  notebook  computers
monitors and televisions  and increasing demand for the large size substrates
however  we expect the growth of lcd glass to be more heavily influenced by the
penetration of lcd in the television end market we anticipate the volume growth
in the lcd market to be over 40 in 2006  we expect the market volume for large
size  glass  substrates  generation  55 and  higher to grow more than 150 in
2006 as a result of the expected  growth in large size  substrates  we believe
our total  glass  volume  will grow  faster than the overall lcd market in 2006
this market  growth is expected to occur at varying  rates in the  principal lcd
markets of japan  taiwan  and korea  sales of our  whollyowned  business  are
primarily  to panel  manufacturers  in japan and taiwan with  customers in korea
being serviced by samsung  corning  precision  the actual growth rates in these
markets will impact our sales and earnings performance

for  2006  we  anticipate   price  declines  that  are  more  significant  than
experienced in previous years as competitors  bring on additional  capacity  in
the third  quarter of 2005  we began  production  at our new  taichung  taiwan
manufacturing facility the rampup of production and our ability to efficiently
start up  operations  may  impact  profitability  the  first  half of  2006  in
addition we are beginning to see increased amounts of largersized glass in the
marketplace  from  competitors  there can be no assurance  that the  endmarket
rates of growth will continue at the high rates  experienced in recent  quarters
or that we will be able to  pace  our  capacity  expansions  to  actual  demand
although we believe we can continue to reduce our manufacturing costs there can
be no assurance that the rate of cost declines will offset price declines in any
given period  while the industry has grown rapidly  consumer  preferences  for
panels of  differing  sizes  or price or other  factors  may lead to pauses in
market growth and it is possible that glass  manufacturing  capacity may exceed
demand  from time to time  in  addition  changes  in foreign  exchange  rates
principally   the  japanese   yen   will  continue  to  impact  the  sales  and
profitability of this segment

2005 vs 2004

results for the  telecommunications  segment  reflected a solid  performance  in
2005  the net sales  increase was largely  driven by sales in north america and
europe  stronger north american volumes and sales of the hardware and equipment
business  were  largely  the  result  of  sales  to  verizon  to  support  their
fibertothe  premises project  excluding the impact of the frequency  controls
business  a hardware and equipment  manufacturer  sold in september  2004  net
sales for the telecommunications  segment increased 10 in 2005 when compared to
the previous  year  movements in exchange  rates did not  significantly  impact
sales for either 2005 or 2004

for the telecommunications  segment net income in 2005 and the net loss in 2004
were impacted by restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits in
2005  we recorded net aftertax  credits of 47 million  related to these items
and in 2004 we recorded  aftertax charges of 1798 million  refer to results
of continuing operations for a detailed discussion of these charges

the  telecommunications  segment continues to have a concentrated customer base
for the year ended  december 31 2005  two customers of the  telecommunications
segment  each of which  accounted  for  more  than 10 of  segment  net  sales
represented 29 of total segment sales for 2005 and 2004 verizon accounted for
17 and 13 respectively of total segment net sales

2004 vs 2003

during 2004 fiber  volumes  grew at 18 while  pricing  declined by 9 from 2003
levels   the  primary   driver  for  the  2004  sales   growth  was   verizons
fibertothepremises  project  in  north  america  with  the  largest  benefit
realized in our hardware and equipment products

offsetting this sales performance were the following items
    during 2003 we  completed  the sale and exit of our  photonic  technologies
     business
    on  september  1  2004  we sold our  frequency  controls  business  this
     business had annual sales of 76 million in 2003
    sales in japan were down in 2004  largely due to 2003  projects  that were
     not repeated in 2004

movements in foreign  currency  exchange  rates  primarily the japanese yen and
euro did not have a significant impact on 2004 sales compared to 2003 in 2004
the   chinese   ministry  of  commerce   issued  an   antidumping   preliminary
determination  asserting that corning had dumped optical fiber into china during
2002 and 2003 and imposed a 16 duty on cornings  optical  fiber  imports which
corning later  contested  although the ministry of commerce  in december 2004
concluded that corning had not dumped optical fiber into china  and removed the
duty cornings market share in china was negatively impacted

the increased net loss for 2004 is primarily attributable to the goodwill fixed
asset and equity method  investments  impairment  charges  recorded in the third
quarter of 2004  refer to  results  of  continuing  operations  for  additional
information on these charges

outlook
for the telecommunications  segment we expect sales in 2006 to remain even with
2005 as volume  gains are  offset by price  declines  we expect  the  worldwide
telecommunications  industry  market  to  remain  stable  particularly  in north
america  sales  volumes  will  largely  be  dependent  on the  continuation  of
verizons  fibertothepremises  project and cable and hardware  and  equipment
sales to private networks  changes in the expected verizon  deployment plan or
additional  reductions  in  their  inventory  levels  of   fibertothepremises
products could also affect the sales level should these plans not occur at the
pace anticipated our sales and earnings would be adversely affected

2005 vs 2004

the 2005  increase  in net sales was the  result of  continued  growth in diesel
products sales in response to tightening  emissions control standards around the
world diesel products sales growth is currently driven in part by demand from
retrofit markets  particularly in korea in the first half of 2005 we received
letters  of  intent  and  other   expressions   of  intent  from  diesel  engine
manufacturers  to supply  filters  for their 2007 model year  platforms  we are
continuing  to negotiate  with several  diesel engine  manufacturers  to develop
supply agreements negotiations are likely to continue through the first half of
2006  for automotive  products  sales in 2005 were flat when compared to prior
year

the 2005  decrease  in net  income  compared  to 2004  resulted  primarily  from
increased operating expenses primarily to support our emerging diesel products

movements in exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales or net income
of this segment in 2005 when compared to 2004

the environmental  technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of
manufacturers  of  catalyzers  and emission  control  systems  who then sell to
automotive  and  diesel  engine  manufacturers  although  our  sales are to the
emission  control systems  manufacturers  the use of our substrates and filters
are generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel engine
manufacturers  for 2005  three  customers  of the  environmental  technologies
segment  each of which  accounted  for  more  than 10 of  segment  net  sales
accounted for 76 of total segment sales

2004 vs 2003

the 2004  increase  in net  sales was  primarily  the  result of demand  for our
automotive and diesel ceramic filters and substrates volumes for our automotive
products were up slightly from 2003 and sales benefited from a higher mix of our
thinwall and ultra thinwall  substrates  which allow engine  manufacturers to
meet their  emissions  control  requirements  in a more cost  effective  manner
diesel  products  sales  growth was  primarily  driven by demand  from  retrofit
markets  although we experienced a softening in asian  retrofit  markets in the
second  half of 2004  movements  in exchange  rates did not have a  significant
impact on sales or net income for 2004 compared to 2003

the 2004 decline in net income is primarily the result of increased  development
costs and plant startup costs to support our emerging  diesel  products  these
costs offset the gross margin  benefits of increased  volumes and the higher mix
of premium automotive products

outlook
we expect sales to increase in 2006 for automotive  products  we expect to see
stable demand based on anticipated  worldwide auto production  although volumes
are  anticipated to be stable  a slowdown in auto  production  particularly in
north america  could adversely  impact our growth  projections  diesel product
sales are expected to grow as diesel engine manufacturers ramp up production for
the 2007 model years  the growth rate of diesel  product  sales in 2006 is very
dependent on the emission  standards for heavy duty engines in the united states
continuing  to be in place  the net loss for the segment is expected to be only
slightly lower in 2006 as we continue to spend heavily on research  development
and engineering for diesel products

2005 vs 2004

the  decrease in net sales is due largely to volume  decreases  as a result of a
change in our  distribution  channel that was made in early 2005 prior to 2005
approximately  56 of the life sciences segment sales were to two  distributors
who  in  turn  sold  to  endusers  such  as  pharmaceutical  and  biotechnology
companies   government  entities  academic  institutions  and  other  research
facilities  as a  result  of a  change  in  business  strategy  by  one  of the
distributors  corning did not renew the distribution  agreement  approximately
30 of life sciences 2004 sales were made through this distributor we have been
successful in  transitioning  the majority of the sales through this distributor
to our remaining primary distributor and other existing and developing channels
as  anticipated  however  the change had a negative impact on sales volumes in
2005 approximately 53 of 2005 sales continued to be made through the remaining
primary distributor


page



the net loss in 2005 was due to lower  sales and higher  operating  expenses  to
implement  the  change in  distribution  channels  and to  support  new  product
development  efforts  movement  in  foreign  exchange  rates  did  not  have  a
significant  impact  on the  comparability  of this  segments  net sales or net
income for 2005 and 2004

2004 vs 2003

the 2004 increase in net sales is primarily due to volume  increases  across the
majority of our product lines demand from research  development and production
endusers  remained steady for 2004  which  represented an improvement over the
industrywide softness experienced in 2003 movements in foreign exchange rates
primarily the euro did not have a significant impact on sales for 2004 compared
to 2003

the 2004  decrease  in net  income  is  largely  attributable  to  gross  margin
improvements  resulting  from the increase in sales  volume being  substantially
offset  by new  product  development  costs  in  addition  in 2003 net  income
benefited  from a gain  recognized on the  disposition  of a minor product line
movement in exchange rates did not significantly impact net income

outlook
sales for 2006 are expected to increase modestly as we continue to regain volume
and due to price  increases in the first  quarter of 2006 we expect a lower net
loss for 2006 as a result of higher sales and a reduction in operating  expenses
offset  somewhat  by a  slightly  higher  level  of  research  development  and
engineering spending

liquidity and capital resources

financing activities

during 2005 we had a number of significant financing transactions  in separate
transactions  we redeemed  or  repurchased  958  million of  debentures  for a
combination  of 579 million cash and 37 million shares of corning common stock
resulting  in an  increase  to  equity of 388  million  we  recognized  losses
totaling 16 million  associated  with the debt  redemptions  in  addition  we
issued 100 million of senior unsecured notes for proceeds of approximately  99
million and we  completed a common stock  offering of 20 million  shares for net
proceeds of approximately 323 million we also contributed 10 million shares of
corning common stock to our us pension plan resulting in an increase to equity
of 199 million as a result of these transactions  and our operating cash flow
in excess of capital  expenditures  we ended the year with cash and  shortterm
investments in excess of debt on our balance sheet

refer to note 11 debt to the consolidated financial statements for further
information

in the first  quarter  of 2005 we  entered a written  agreement  with a group of
banks on a new revolving credit facility the new facility provides us access to
a 975 million unsecured  multicurrency revolving line of credit and expires in
march 2010 the facility includes two financial covenants  a leverage ratio and
an interest coverage ratio both of which we are in compliance and also includes
restrictions  on the  declaration of dividends  concurrent  with the closing of
this credit  facility  we terminated our previous 2 billion  revolving line of
credit that was set to expire in august 2005

customer deposits

certain  customers  of  our  display  technologies  segment  have  entered  into
longterm  supply  agreements and agreed to make advance cash deposits to secure
supply of largesize  glass  substrates  the deposits  will be reduced  through
future product purchases thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as
credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods



customer  deposits  have been or will be received in the  following  periods in
millions

                                                                                   estimated 2006

the majority of the remaining  customer  deposits will be received through 2006
in 2005 we issued 29 million in credit memoranda these credit amounts are not
included in the above amounts and were applied against customer receivables

in 2006  we  expect  to issue  credits  approximately  equal to the  amount  of
deposits expected to be received in 2006

capital spending

capital  spending  totaled 16 billion  857 million and 366 million in 2005
2004 and 2003  respectively  capital spending  activity in 2005 2004 and 2003
primarily included expansion of lcd capacity in the display technologies segment
and new capacity for diesel products in the environmental  technologies segment
our 2006 capital spending program is expected to be in the range of 13 billion
to 15  billion  of which  900  million  to 11  billion  will be to  expand
manufacturing  capacity  for lcd glass  substrates  in the display  technologies
segment  these expenditures  primarily relate to previously announced expansion
plans for our existing  manufacturing  facilities in tainan  taiwan  taichung
taiwan and shizuoka  japan  additionally  approximately 200 million will be
directed toward our environmental  technologies  segment to support the emerging
diesel emissions control products

restructuring

during 2005  2004 and 2003 we made payments of 25 million  85 million  and
233 million  respectively  related to employee severance and other exit costs
resulting from restructuring  actions cash payments for employeerelated  costs
will be  substantially  completed  by the end of 2007  while  payments for exit
activities will be substantially completed by the end of 2010

key balance sheet data

at december 31 2005 cash cash equivalents and shortterm  investments totaled
24 billion compared with 19 billion at december 31 2004 the increase from
december 31 2004  was  primarily  due to operating  cash flows at 19 billion
which included 428 million of customer  deposits net of credits issued offset
by 16 billion of capital spending  net financing activities generated cash of
approximately 147 million

management assessment of liquidity

our major source of funding for 2006 and beyond will be our existing  balance of
cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments from time to time we may also
issue debt or equity  securities to raise  additional  cash to fund a portion of
our capital  expenditures  related to our growth businesses  we believe we have
sufficient   liquidity   for  the  next  several   years  to  fund   operations
restructuring  the  asbestos  settlement  research  and  development  capital
expenditures and scheduled debt repayments

off balance sheet arrangements

off balance sheet arrangements are transactions agreements or other contractual
arrangements  with an  unconsolidated  entity that corning has an  obligation to
that are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements

cornings off balance sheet arrangements include the following
    guarantee  contracts that require  applying the  measurement  provisions of
     fasb issued  interpretation no 45 guarantors  accounting and disclosure
     requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness
     of others fin 45 and
    variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities

fin 45 requires a company  at the time a guarantee  is issued  to  recognize a
liability for the fair value or market value of the  obligation  it assumes  in
the normal  course of our  business  we do not  routinely  provide  significant
thirdparty  guarantees  generally  thirdparty guarantees provided by corning
are  limited to certain  financial  guarantees  including  standby  letters of
credit and performance  bonds  and the incurrence of contingent  liabilities in
the form of purchase  price  adjustments  related to attainment  of  milestones
these   guarantees  have  various  terms  and  none  of  these  guarantees  are
individually significant

refer to note 13 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information

corning has variable  interests in three variable  interest  entities from which
corning leases transportation equipment

for  variable  interest  entities  we assess the terms of our  interest  in the
entity to determine if we are the primary  beneficiary as prescribed by fin 46r
consolidation of variable  interest  entities  an  interpretation of accounting
research  bulletin  no 51  revised  fin 46r  the primary  beneficiary  of a
variable  interest  entity is the party that  absorbs a majority of the entitys
expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns or both
as a result of holding variable interests which are the ownership contractual
or other  pecuniary  interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair
value of the entitys net assets excluding  variable  interests  we consolidate
one variable interest entity in which we are the primary beneficiary

corning leases certain transportation equipment from a trust that qualifies as a
variable  interest  entity  under fin 46r  the sole  purpose of this  entity is
leasing  transportation  equipment  to  corning  since  corning is the  primary
beneficiary of this entity the financial  statements of the entity are included
in cornings consolidated financial statements

corning leases certain transportation  equipment from two additional trusts that
qualify as variable  interest entities under fin 46r corning is not the primary
beneficiary  of these  entities  the sole  purpose of the  entities  is leasing
transportation  equipment  to  corning  corning  has been  involved  with these
entities as lessee since the inception of the trusts

corning  does  not  have  retained   interest  in  assets   transferred   to  an
unconsolidated entity that serve as credit  liquidity or market risk support to
that entity

sfas no 133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance
sheet at fair market value sfas no 133  paragraph 11a states that contracts
that are indexed to an entitys own stock and  classified  in the  shareholders
equity  section of the  consolidated  financial  statements  are not  considered
derivative  instruments  and are  therefore  excluded  from the  balance  sheet
although  corning  has  contracts  that  are  indexed  to our own  stock  these
contracts are not  classified  within the  shareholders  equity  section of the
consolidated  financial  statements  and  therefore  are  considered  derivative
instruments and are accounted for as such

1  at december 31 2005  34 million of the 47 million was included in other
     accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets
2  capital   expenditure   obligations   primarily  related  to  our  display
     technologies segment expansions are included on our balance sheet
3  at december 31  2005  1807  million was included on our balance  sheet
     amounts above are stated at their maturity value
4  the estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date
     of  maturityexpiration of the related debt based upon stated rates in the
     respective debt instruments

we have provided financial guarantees and contingent  liabilities in the form of
standby  letters of credit  and  performance  bonds  some of which do not have
fixed or scheduled expiration dates we have agreed to provide a credit facility
related to dow corning as noted above and discussed in note 7 investments  and
note  13  commitments  contingencies  and  guarantees  to  the  consolidated
financial  statements  the funding of the dow corning  credit  facility will be
required only if dow corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding
obligations  in its  confirmed  bankruptcy  plan  we  believe  the  significant
majority of these  guarantees  and  contingent  liabilities  will expire without
being funded

pensions

we have a number of defined benefit pension plans covering  certain domestic and
international  employees  our largest  single  pension plan is  cornings  us
qualified  plan  at  december  31  2005  this plan  accounted  for 81 of our
consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and 91
of the related plans assets  in 2004  although  global  equities had positive
returns interest rates continued to decline as a result at december 31 2004
the  accumulated  benefit  obligation  abo  for  our  domestic  qualified  and
nonqualified  plans and several  international plans exceeded the fair value of
related plan assets  requiring corning to record an additional  minimum pension
liability in accordance with sfas no 87 employers  accounting for pensions
however  in 2005  due  primarily  to  contributions  of  corning  stock to the
domestic  qualified  pension  plan  the fair  value of this  plans  assets  at
december 31 2005 exceeded the abo and  accordingly  corning  eliminated  this
plans minimum pension liability

we have  traditionally  contributed  to the us  qualified  pension  plan on an
annual  basis  in  excess  of the irs  minimum  requirements  and as a  result
mandatory  contributions  are not expected to be required for this plan until at
least 2008  for 2005 we issued and  contributed  10 million  shares of corning
common stock with a value of approximately  199 million to our domestic pension
plan  in 2004  we  contributed  40  million  to our  us  pension  plan  we
anticipate  making voluntary  contributions of approximately 35 million in cash
to our domestic and international pension plans in 2006

environment

we have been named by the  environmental  protection  agency under the superfund
act  or by  state  governments  under  similar  state  laws  as a  potentially
responsible party for 11 active hazardous waste sites  under the superfund act
all  parties  who may have  contributed  any waste to a  hazardous  waste  site
identified  by such  agency  are jointly and  severally  liable for the cost of
cleanup unless the agency agrees  otherwise  it is our policy to accrue for the
estimated   liability  related  to  superfund  sites  and  other   environmental
liabilities  related  to  property  owned  and  operated  by us based on  expert
analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants  we
have  accrued  approximately  13  million   undiscounted  for  the  estimated
liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation at december 31 2005
based upon the information developed to date we believe that the accrued amount
is a reasonable  estimate of our  liability  and that the risk of an  additional
loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote

critical accounting policies and estimates

the  preparation  of  financial  statements  requires us to make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect amounts  reported  therein  the  estimates  including
future  projections of performance and relevant discount rates that required us
to make difficult subjective or complex judgments follow

impairment of goodwill

sfas 142 requires us to make certain difficult subjective and complex judgments
on a number of matters  including  assumptions  and estimates used to determine
the fair value of our reporting units which are the same as our segments

we measure fair value on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows our
estimates are based upon our historical  experience  our current knowledge from
our commercial  relationships  and available external  information about future
trends

telecommunications

results for the  telecommunications  segment in 2005 were moderate as pricing in
the  telecommunications  industry continues to decline  we expect the worldwide
telecommunications  industry  market  to  remain  stable  particularly  in north
america  and fiber  volumes to  increase  modestly  and  pricing  pressures  to
continue

for our 2005 impairment  test we used a discount rate of 13 in our calculation
of fair value of the expected  future cash flows  the results of our 2005 tests
indicated that goodwill was not impaired the results would not have changed had
we used a discount  rate of 125 or 135  in 2004  an  impairment  charge of
1420  million was recorded  we used a 125 discount rate for our 2004 annual
impairment test had we used a discount rate of 12 the impairment charge would
have been  approximately  90 million lower had we used a discount rate of 13
the impairment charge would have been approximately 80 million higher terminal
value of the business  assumes a growth in perpetuity of 3 business cash flows
are also used to value  intangible  and  tangible  assets  which  determine  the
implied  value of reporting  unit  goodwill  the discount rate applied to these
cash flows  represents  a  telecommunications  weighted  average cost of capital
based upon current debt and equity activity of 12 public companies  representing
a cross section of worldwide  competitors of the reporting  unit  growth in the
telecommunications  segment is dependent  upon  cornings  success in delivering
results in fibertothepremises applications increased fiber price pressure or
lack of  fibertothepremises  penetration may precipitate  additional goodwill
charges in the future


page



specialty materials

our  discounted  cash  flow  test for this  reporting  unit  assumes a growth in
perpetuity  of 3  the  discount  rate  applied  to the  forecasted  cash flows
represents  weighed  average cost of capital  based upon current debt and equity
activity of seven public  companies  representing  a cross  section of worldwide
competitors  of the reporting  unit for the 2005 and 2004  impairment  tests we
used a risk adjusted discount rate of 13 and 12 in our calculation of the fair
value of the expected future cash flows  respectively  the results of our 2005
and 2004 tests  indicated that goodwill was not impaired  the results would not
have changed had we used a discount rate of 125 or 135 for 2005 and 115 or
125 for 2004

impairment of assets held for use

sfas no 144  accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets
requires us to assess the  recoverability  of the carrying  value of  longlived
assets when an event of impairment  has occurred  we must exercise  judgment in
assessing  whether  an  event  of  impairment  has  occurred  for  purposes  of
recognition and measurement of an impairment  loss a longlived asset or assets
is grouped  with  other  assets and  liabilities  at the lowest  level for which
identifiable  cash  flows are  largely  independent  of the cash  flows of other
assets and liabilities  we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level
for which  identifiable cash flows are largely  independent of the cash flows of
other  assets and  liabilities  in certain  circumstances  we  concluded  that
locations or businesses  which share  production  along the supply chain must be
combined  in  order to  appropriately  identify  cash  flows  that  are  largely
independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities

once  it has  been  judged  that  an  impairment  has  occurred  an  impairment
assessment  requires  exercise of judgment  in  assessing  the future use of and
projected value to be derived from the impaired assets to be held and used this
may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates
and terminal  values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets
to be held and used

in 2004  based on our decision to permanently  abandon certain assets and lower
our  outlook  for the  telecommunications  segment  we  determined  an event of
impairment  had  occurred in our  telecommunications  segment  we  performed an
impairment test on the segments  longlived  assets and recorded a 24 million
charge to writedown certain assets to their fair value

in 2003 we concluded events of impairment had occurred in our semiconductor
materials product line which is part of the specialty materials segment and
performed an impairment test the results of our test indicated that our
longlived assets held for use were not impaired

restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions

sfas  no  146   accounting  for  costs   associated  with  exit  or  disposal
activities  requires us to assess whether and when a  restructuring  event has
occurred  and in  which  periods  charges  related  to  such  events  should  be
recognized  we must  estimate  costs  of plans to  restructure  including  for
example  employee  termination  costs  restructuring  charges  require  us  to
exercise  judgment  about the  expected  future of our  businesses  of portions
thereof  their  profitability  cash  flows and in certain  instances  eventual
outcome  the judgment  involved can be difficult  subjective  and complex in a
number of areas  including  assumptions  and estimates  used in  estimating  the
future profitability and cash flows of our businesses

restructuring  events  often  give rise to  decisions  to  dispose of or abandon
certain  assets or asset  groups  which  as a  result  require  impairment  in
accordance  with sfas 144  sfas 144  requires us to carry  assets to be sold or
abandoned  at the lower of cost or fair  value  we must  exercise  judgment  in
assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned

during 2004 and 2003 we recorded  writedowns of property  plant and equipment
as a result of decisions to exit facilities primarily in the telecommunications
segment assets impaired were primarily equipment  construction in progress and
buildings  which were sold or abandoned  we used  information  available  from
recent auctions of  telecommunications  equipment to estimate salvage value when
measuring impairment  the estimated salvage values were very low primarily due
to the depressed market for  telecommunications  related equipment  the salvage
values of  property  impaired  were also  estimated  to be  minimal  as  certain
facilities  will be abandoned and not sold  it is possible that actual  results
will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to reserves

valuation allowances for deferred income taxes

sfas 109  accounting for income taxes requires us to exercise  judgment about
our future  results in assessing the  realizability  of our deferred tax assets
inherent  in this  estimation  process  especially  since we are in a net gross
deferred tax asset position  in part due to prior year net operating losses is
the  requirement  for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax
planning  strategies  these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our
future  results  and the  prudence  and  feasibility  of possible  tax  planning
strategies as more fully discussed in note 6 income taxes corning determined
that a tax planning strategy  considered  previously to be prudent was no longer
prudent as such a 525 million adjustment was recorded in 2005 to increase the
valuation allowance to fully reserve our us deferred tax assets

if we sustain an appropriate level of  profitability  primarily in the us and
germany  or if we are able to develop tax planning  strategies  adjustments to
these allowances will be required and may affect future net income

probability of litigation outcomes

sfas  no  5  accounting  for  contingencies  sfas 5  requires  us to make
judgments  about  future  events  that  are  inherently  uncertain   in  making
determinations  of likely  outcomes  of  litigation  matters  we  consider  the
evaluation of outside counsel  knowledgeable about each matter as well as known
outcomes in case law see legal proceedings for a detailed discussion of the key
litigation  matters we face the most significant  matter involving  judgment is
the pcc  asbestos  liability  there are a number of  factors  bearing  upon our
potential  liability  including the inherent complexity of a chapter 11 filing
our history of success in  defending  ourselves  against  asbestos  claims  our
assessment  of the  strength of our  corporate  veil  defenses  our  continuing
dialogue with our insurance  carriers and the  claimants  representatives  and
other  factors  we have reached a tentative  settlement  on pcc as disclosed in
legal  proceedings  and  note  7  investments  to the  consolidated  financial
statements  the settlement is subject to a number of  contingencies  including
approval by the bankruptcy court and resolution of any appeals

other possible liabilities

sfas 5 and other similarly  focused  accounting  literature  requires us to make
judgments  about  future  events  that  are  inherently  uncertain   in  making
determinations  of likely  outcomes of certain  matters  including  certain tax
planning  matters  and  environmental  matters  these  judgments  require us to
consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining  whether
probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure

pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb

pension and opeb costs and  obligations  are  dependent on  assumptions  used in
calculating such amounts  these assumptions include discount rates health care
cost trend  rates  benefits  earned  interest  cost  expected  return on plan
assets  mortality  rates  and other factors  in accordance with gaap  actual
results that differ from the  assumptions  are  accumulated  and amortized  over
future  periods and  therefore  generally  affect  recognized  expense and the
recorded  obligation  in future  periods  while  management  believes  that the
assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in
assumptions may affect cornings  pension and other  postretirement  obligations
and future expense

as of december 31 2005 the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension
plans was 2202  million and the minimum  pension  liability  charges to equity
with respect to us pension plans was 22 million net of tax



the following  information  illustrates  the  sensitivity to a change in certain
assumptions for us pension plans

                                                                                                     effect on

25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets          48 million
25 basis point increase in expected return on assets        48 million



the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time
it should be noted that economic  factors and conditions  often affect  multiple
assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not
necessarily linear


page



these  changes  in  assumptions  would  have  no  effect  on  cornings  funding
requirements  in addition  at december 31 2005 a 25 basis point  decrease in
the discount rate would decrease  stockholders equity by 2 million before tax
a 25 basis point  increase in the  discount  rate would  increase  stockholders
equity by 2 million  with a 25 basis  point  decrease  in the  discount  rate
certain  pension  plans  would  become  accumulated   benefit  obligation  abo
underfunded  resulting in a significantly  larger impact on equity compared to a
25 basis point increase in the discount rate in addition the impact of greater
than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the
first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate



the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate
assumption related to cornings us opeb plans

25 basis point increase in discount rate                        1 million                        24 million



the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time
it should be noted that economic  factors and conditions  often affect  multiple
assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not
necessarily linear

revenue recognition

in certain instances revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of
deliverables as well as estimates of product returns allowances  discounts and
other  factors   while   management   believes  that  the  estimates  used  are
appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect
cornings future results

stock compensation

stock based  compensation  expense and  disclosures are dependent on assumptions
used in calculating such amounts  these assumptions  include riskfree discount
rates  expected  term  of the  stock  based  compensation  instrument  granted
volatility of stock and option prices expected time between grant date and date
of  exercise  attrition  performance  and other  factors  these  assumptions
require us to exercise  judgment  our estimates of these assumptions  typically
are based upon our historical  experience and also  currently  available  market
place data while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate
differences in actual  experience or changes in assumptions may affect cornings
future stock based compensation expense and disclosures

item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks


we operate and conduct  business in many foreign  countries  and as a result are
exposed to  movements  in foreign  currency  exchange  rates  our  exposure  to
exchange rate effects includes

    exchange  rate  movements  on  financial   instruments   and   transactions
     denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings and
    exchange  rate  movements   upon   conversion  of  net  assets  in  foreign
     subsidiaries  for which the  functional  currency  is not the us  dollar
     which impact our net equity

our most significant foreign currency exposure is the japanese yen and to a much
lesser extent the korean won the taiwan  dollar  and the euro we  selectively
enter  into  foreign  exchange  forward  and  option  contracts  with  durations
generally  15 months  or less to hedge our  exposure  to  exchange  rate risk on
foreign  source  income and  purchases  these  hedges are  scheduled  to mature
coincident with the timing of the underlying  foreign  currency  commitments and
transactions  the objective of these  contracts is to neutralize  the impact of
exchange  rate  movements on our operating  results  we also enter into foreign
exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign  subsidiaries
or corning enter into lending  situations  generally on an intercompany  basis
denominated  in currencies  other than their local  currency  we do not hold or
issue derivative  financial  instruments for trading purposes  in 2005 corning
began using derivative  instruments  forwards to limit the exposure to foreign
currency  fluctuations  associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities
these  derivative  instruments  are not  designated as hedging  instruments  for
accounting  purposes  and  as such  are  referred to as  undesignated  hedges
changes in the fair value of undesignated  hedges  along with foreign  currency
gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities are
recorded in current  period  earnings in the other income  net component in the
consolidated statement of operations

equity in  earnings of  associated  companies  has  historically  contributed  a
significant amount to our income from continuing operations  equity in earnings
of associated  companies  net of impairments  was 598 million in 2005 and 443
million  in 2004  with  foreignbased  affiliates  comprising  over  43 of this
amount  equity  earnings  from samsung  corning and samsung  corning  precision
totaled  296  million  for  2005 and  309  million  for  2004  exchange  rate
fluctuations  and actions taken by  management of these  entities can affect the
earnings of these companies

we use a  sensitivity  analysis  to assess the market risk  associated  with our
foreign currency  exchange risk  market risk is defined as the potential change
in fair value of assets and  liabilities  resulting from an adverse  movement in
foreign  currency  exchange  rates  at december 31  2005  we had open forward
contracts  open  option  contracts  and foreign  denominated  debt with values
exposed to exchange rate  movements  all of which were  designated as hedges at
december 31 2005 a 10 adverse  movement in quoted foreign  currency  exchange
rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 138 million
specific  to the  japanese  yen a 10 adverse  movement in quoted yen  exchange
rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 75 million

as we derive approximately 70 of our net sales from outside the us our sales
and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or
weakens against foreign currencies  most notably the japanese yen and euro our

information  contained  under the caption audit and nonaudit fees in our 2006
proxy statement

our  independent  auditor  pricewaterhousecoopers  llp  pwc  has  recently
notified  the audit  committee  of  cornings  board of  directors  the  audit
committee that certain nonaudit work performed by its network firms in europe
and china raised questions regarding pwcs independence with respect to its role
as cornings independent auditor

network firms of pwc performed  certain vat tax  representation  and  remittance
services for corning entities in europe and paid government charges on behalf of
corning in china  the payment of the taxes or fees and the handling of company
funds by an outside  auditor is not  permitted  under sec  auditor  independence
rules  unremitted  amounts for a vat refund due corning as of december 31 2005
were approximately 50000 the fee paid to tax authorities on behalf of corning

is based upon the nature of services and the fact that none of its personnel who
were involved in providing these tax services or remitting  amounts on cornings
behalf  performed any audit or  auditrelated  services for corning  in january
2006 pwc issued its  independence  standards  board standard no 1 independence

telecommunications segment

competition  within the  telecommunications  equipment industry is intense among
several significant companies  corning is a leading competitor in the segments
principal  product  lines  price and new product  innovations  are  significant
competitive factors the continued downturn in the telecommunications  industry
particularly in europe and north america has changed the competitive  landscape
by increasing  competition based upon pricing  these competitive conditions are
likely to persist

advantage  through  customer  support  logistics  expertise  and a  lower  cost
manufacturing  structure  nippon electric glass asahi and various other asian
manufacturers compete with samsung corning

raw materials

cornings  production  of  specialty  glasses  and  related  materials  requires
significant quantities of energy and batch materials

although energy shortages have not been a problem  recently  the cost of energy
has increased  corning has achieved  flexibility through important  engineering
changes to take advantage of the lowestcost  energy source in most  significant
processes specifically many of cornings principal manufacturing processes can
now be operated with natural gas propane oil or electricity  or a combination
of these energy sources

as to resources ores minerals  polymers and processed chemicals required in
manufacturing  operations   availability  appears  to  be  adequate  cornings
suppliers  from time to time may  experience  capacity  limitations in their own
operations  or may  eliminate  certain  product  lines  nevertheless  corning
believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch chemicals
and raw materials  for many products  corning has alternate glass compositions
that would allow  operations to continue  without  interruption  in the event of
specific materials shortages

certain key materials used in the  manufacturing  of products are currently sole
sourced  or  available  only from a  limited  number of  suppliers  any  future
difficulty  in obtaining  sufficient  and timely  delivery of  components  could
result in delays or reductions in product  shipments  or reduce cornings gross
margins

patents and trademarks

inventions by members of cornings research and engineering staff have been and
continue to be important to the companys growth  patents have been granted on
many of these inventions in the united states us and other  countries  some
of these patents have been licensed to other manufacturers  including companies
in which corning has equity  investments  many of the earlier  patents have now
expired  but corning continues to seek and obtain patents  protecting its newer
innovations  in 2004 corning was granted over 300 patents in the us and over
300 patents in countries outside the us

each business  segment  possesses its own patent portfolio that provides certain
competitive  advantages  in  protecting  cornings   innovations   corning  has
historically  enforced  and will continue to enforce its intellectual property
rights  at the end of 2004  corning  and its  subsidiaries  owned  over  4900
unexpired  patents in various  countries of which over 2400 were us  patents
between 2005 and 2007  approximately 4 of these patents will expire  while at
the same time corning intends to seek patents  protecting its newer innovations
worldwide  corning has over 3300 patent applications in process with over 825
in process in the us as a result  corning  believes that its patent portfolio
will  continue  to  provide a  competitive  advantage  in  protecting  cornings
innovation  although  cornings  competitors  in  each  of its  businesses  are
actively seeking patent protection as well

the display  technologies  segment has over 200 patents in various  countries of

protection of the environment

corning  has a program to ensure  that its  facilities  are in  compliance  with
state federal and foreign pollutioncontrol  regulations this program resulted
in capital and operating expenditures during the past several years in order to
maintain  compliance with such regulations  capital  expenditures for pollution
control in continuing  operations were approximately 16 million in 2004 and are
estimated to be 26 million in 2005

cornings 2004 operating  results from  continuing  operations were charged with
approximately  40 million for  depreciation  maintenance  waste  disposal and
other operating  expenses  associated with pollution  control  corning believes
that its compliance program will not place it at a competitive disadvantage

our  sales  could be  negatively  impacted  if one or more of our key  customers
substantially reduce orders for our products

     our customer base is relatively  concentrated with less than 10 significant
customers  accounting for a high  percentage  greater than 50 of net sales in
most of our  businesses  including  those  purchasing  lcd glass  however  no
individual customer accounts for more than 10 of consolidated sales

     our display technologies  telecommunications  environmental technologies
and life  sciences  segments  have  concentrated  customer  bases  if we lose a
significant  customer in any of these businesses  or if one or more significant
customers  reduce  orders  our  sales  could be  negatively  impacted  corning
manufactures  and  sells  glass  substrates  to  a  concentrated  customer  base
comprised of lcd panel makers  primarily  located in japan and taiwan  the most
significant   customers  in  these  markets  are  au optronics  corp  chi  mei
optoelectronics  corp  hannstar  display  corp  quanta  display inc  sharp
corporation  and toppan cfi  taiwan  co  ltd  for the twelve  months ended
december  31 2004  these six lcd  customers  accounted  for 76 of the display
technologies segment sales in addition  samsung corning precisions sales were
also  concentrated  with three lcd panel makers in korea  samsung  electronics
co ltd lg philips lcd co and boe hydis  technology  co ltd  accounting
for 88 of sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2004

     although the sale of lcd glass  substrates  increased in 2004 there can be
no assurance  that positive  trends will  continue  our customers are lcd panel
makers and as they switch to larger size glass the pace of their orders may be
uneven  while  they  adjust  their   manufacturing   processes  and  facilities
additionally  consumer  preferences for panels of differing  sizes or price or
other factors  may lead to pauses in market growth from time to time  there is
further  risk  that  our  customers  may  not be  able  to  maintain  profitable
operations or access sufficient capital to fund ongoing expansions

     our  telecommunications  segment  customers  purchases of our products are
affected  by  their  capital  expansion  plans   general  market  and  economic
uncertainty and regulatory  changes  including broadband policy for the twelve
months ended december 31 2004 one customer  accounted for approximately 13 of
our  telecommunications  segment  sales  and 10 customers  accounted for 47 of
total segment sales sales growth in the  telecommunications  segment is largely
dependent  on the  continuation  of  the  recent  verizon  fibertothepremises
project  should this deployment not occur at the pace  anticipated  our future
sales would be adversely impacted

     in the environmental  technologies segment  sales of our ceramic substrate
and filter  products for automotive and diesel  emissions and pollution  control
fluctuate with production and sales of automobiles  and other vehicles  as well
as changes in  governmental  laws and  regulations  for air quality and emission
controls sales in our environmental  technologies segment are primarily to four
manufacturers of emission control systems who then sell to automotive and diesel
engine manufacturers

     sales  in our  life  sciences  segment  are  primarily  through  two  large
distributors to government entities pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
hospitals  universities  and other  research  facilities  one of life sciences
primary distributors has recently  communicated its intent to change its ongoing
business  strategy  subsequent  to december 31  2004  corning  notified  this
distributor that we will not renew its existing  distribution  agreement  which
will expire in april  2005  we are  actively  working to  transition  the sales
through this distributor to our remaining primary distributor and other existing
and developing channels however this change will likely adversely impact sales
volumes in the short term

if we do not  successfully  adjust  our  manufacturing  volumes  and fixed  cost
structure  or achieve  manufacturing  yields or sufficient product reliability
our operating results could suffer and we may not achieve  profitability levels
anticipated

     we are investing  heavily in additional  manufacturing  capacity of certain
businesses  including 640 million in 2004 to expand our liquid crystal display
glass  facilities in response to  anticipated  increases in customer  demand and
124 million in anticipation of the emerging market for diesel emission  control
systems  the speed of constructing the new facilities presents  challenges  we
may face  technical  and  process  issues  in moving  to  commercial  production
capacity  there  can be no  assurance  that  corning  will be able to pace  its
capacity  expansion to the actual demand  while the industry has grown rapidly
it is possible  that glass  manufacturing  capacity may exceed  customer  demand
during certain periods

     the  manufacturing  of our  products  involves  highly  complex and precise
processes requiring production in highly controlled and clean environments any
changes  in  our  manufacturing  processes  or  those  of  our  suppliers  could
significantly reduce our manufacturing  yields and product reliability  in some
cases  existing  manufacturing  may be  insufficient  to achieve  the volume or
requirements  of our  customers  we will  need  to  develop  new  manufacturing
processes and  techniques to achieve  targeted  volume  pricing and cost levels
that will permit  profitable  operations  while we continue to fund projects to
improve  our  manufacturing   techniques  and  processes  we  may  not  achieve
satisfactory cost levels in our manufacturing activities that will fully satisfy
our yield and margin targets

we have incurred and may in the future incur  restructuring and other charges
the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately

     as  a  result  of a  severe  decline  in  the  telecommunications  industry
beginning  in  2001  we  have  recorded  several  charges  for   restructuring
impairment of assets  and the  writeoff of cost and equity based  investments
most  recently  in the third  quarter  of 2004  it is  possible  we may  record
additional  charges for  restructuring or other asset  impairments if additional
actions become necessary to align costs to a reduced level of demand or respond
to increased  competition  regulatory  actions  or other factors impacting our
businesses

if the  markets for our  products  do not  develop and expand as we  anticipate
demand for our products may decline further  which would negatively  impact our
results of operations and financial performance

     the  markets  for  our  products  are  characterized  by  rapidly  changing
technologies  evolving industry  government  standards and frequent new product
introductions  our success is expected to depend  in substantial  part on the
timely and successful introduction of new products upgrades of current products
to comply with emerging industry  government  standards  our ability to acquire
technologies  needed to remain  competitive and our ability to address competing
technologies  and products  in addition  the following  factors related to our
products and the markets for them if not achieved could have an adverse impact
on our results of operations and financial performance

         our ability to introduce leading products such as glass substrates for
          liquid crystal  displays  optical fiber and  environmental  substrate
          products that can command competitive prices in the marketplace
         our  ability to  maintain  or achieve a  favorable  sales mix of large
          generation sizes of display glass
         our ability to  continue  to develop new product  lines to address our
          customers  diverse needs within the several  market  segments that we
          participate in which requires a high level of innovation  as well as
          the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends
         our  ability  to  develop  new   products  in  response  to  favorable
          government regulations and laws driving customer demand  particularly
          environmental  substrate  diesel filter products in the  environmental
          technologies   segment   and   telecommunications   segment   products
          associated with fibertothepremises
         continued strong demand for notebook computers
         the rate of  substitution  by  endusers  purchasing  lcd  monitors to
          replace cathode ray tube monitors
         the rate of growth in purchases of lcd  televisions  to replace  other
          technologies
         fluctuations  in  inventory  levels in the supply  chain of  lcdbased
          consumer electronics
         the ability to reallocate lcd glass to other  customers in response to
          canceled orders or
         the rate of growth  of the  fibertothepremises  buildout  in north
          america

we face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely
affect our results of operations and financial performance

     we periodically face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses as
a result of intense  competition  emerging new technologies  or overcapacity
while we will work toward reducing our costs to respond to the pricing pressures
that may  continue  we may not be able to achieve  proportionate  reductions in
costs  as a result  of  overcapacity  and the  current  economic  and  industry
downturn in the telecommunications segment pricing pressures continued in 2004
particularly  in our optical fiber and cable  products  we  anticipate  pricing
pressures  will continue  into 2005 and beyond  increased  pricing  pressure is
likely in our display  technologies  segment as our  customers  strive to reduce
their costs

we have  incurred  and may in the future incur  goodwill and other  intangible
asset impairment charges

     at december 31 2004  corning had goodwill of 282 million including 123
million related to the telecommunications  segment during the third quarter of
2004  we  recorded  a  1420  million  impairment  charge  to  writedown  the
telecommunications segment goodwill balance to its estimated fair value

     while we believe the estimates  and judgments  about future cash flows used
in the goodwill  impairment  tests are reasonable  we cannot provide  assurance
that future  impairment  charges will not be required if the expected  cash flow
estimates  as  projected  by  management  do not occur or change based on market
conditions

we may be limited in our ability to obtain  additional  capital on  commercially
reasonable terms

     although we believe  existing cash  shortterm  investments  and borrowing
capacity  collectively  provide adequate  resources to fund ongoing  operating
requirements  we may be  required  to  seek  additional  financing  to  compete
effectively in our markets  our public debt ratings affect our ability to raise
capital and the cost of such  capital  our ratings as of february 22 2005 were
bb from both fitch and standard  poors and ba2 from moodys  any  downgrades
may  increase  our  borrowing  costs and affect  our  ability to access the debt
capital markets

     we are subject  under our  revolving  credit  facility  to a covenant  that
requires us to maintain a ratio of total debt to capital  as defined  under the
credit  facility  of not greater than 60 our total debt to capital  ratio was
41 at december  31 2004  this  covenant  limits our ability to borrow  funds
future losses or significant charges could materially increase our total debt to
capital  ratio  which may  reduce the  amounts  we are able to borrow  under our
existing  revolving credit facility or adversely affect our ability to negotiate
a new revolving  credit facility in 2005 our revolving  credit facility expires
in  august  2005  and  we  are  currently  negotiating  with  leading  financial
institutions  to arrange a new  credit  facility  we believe  that a new credit
facility will be arranged and executed in the first half of 2005 on  competitive
terms and conditions corning is seeking up to a 1 billion credit facility with
up to a five year term among the terms and conditions being negotiated corning
believes it will be subject to two financial covenants

if our products or materials purchased from our suppliers experience performance
issues our business will suffer

     our  business   depends  on  the   production  of  excellent   products  of
consistently  high  quality  to this end  our  products  including  materials
purchased  from  our  suppliers  are  tested  for  quality  both  by us and our
customers  nevertheless  our products are highly  complex  and our customers
testing  procedures  are limited to  evaluating  our  products  under likely and
foreseeable failure scenarios for various reasons including among others the
occurrence of performance problems  unforeseeable in testing  our products and
materials  purchased  from  our  suppliers  may  fail to  perform  as  expected
performance  issues could result from faulty design or problems in manufacturing
or testing  we have experienced such performance  issues in the past and remain
exposed  to  such  performance  issues  in some  cases  product  redesigns  or
additional  capital  equipment may be required to correct a defect in addition
any significant or systemic  product failure could result in customer  relations
problems and harm the future sales of our products

we face intense competition in most of our businesses

     we  expect  that  we  will  face  additional   competition   from  existing
competitors  low  cost  manufacturers  and new  entrants  because  some of the
markets in which we compete have been historically characterized by rapid growth
and are  characterized by rapid technology  changes  smaller niche and startup
companies  or companies  with lower  operating  costs may become our  principal
competitors in the future  we must invest in research and  development  expand
our  engineering  manufacturing  and  marketing  capabilities  and continue to
improve customer service and support in order to remain  competitive  we cannot
provide  assurance  that we will be able to maintain or improve our  competitive
position

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and
we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual  property rights
of others

     we may encounter  difficulties  in  protecting  our  intellectual  property
rights or obtaining  rights to  additional  intellectual  property  necessary to
permit us to continue or expand our  businesses  we cannot  assure you that the
patents that we hold or may obtain will provide  meaningful  protection  against
our  competitors  or  competitive  technologies  litigation may be necessary to
enforce our intellectual  property  rights  to protect our trade secrets and to
determine  the  validity  and scope of our  proprietary  rights  litigation  is
inherently  uncertain and the outcome is often  unpredictable  other  companies
hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking
to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios

introduce new products  we are and may in the future be  subject to claims of
intellectual  property  infringement or misappropriation that may result in loss
of revenue or require us to incur substantial  costs we cannot assure you as to
the outcome of such claims

current or future  litigation  may harm our  financial  condition  or results of
operations

     pending   threatened   or  future   litigation   is  subject  to  inherent
uncertainties our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely
affected by unfavorable outcomes expenses and costs exceeding amounts estimated
or  insured  in  particular  we have been  named as a  defendant  in  numerous
lawsuits  against pcc and several other  defendants  involving  claims  alleging
personal  injury from exposure to asbestos  as described in legal  proceedings
our negotiations with the  representatives of asbestos claimants have produced a
tentative settlement  but certain cases may still be litigated  final approval
of a global settlement through the pcc bankruptcy process may impact the results
of operations for the period in which such costs if any are recognized  total
charges of 446 million have been incurred through  december 31 2004  however

we face risks related to our international operations and sales

     we have customers and significant  operations  including manufacturing and
sales  located  outside the us  we have large  manufacturing  operations  for
liquid crystal display glass  substrates in the asiapacific  region  including
equity  investments  in  companies  operating  in south  korea that make  liquid
crystal display glass and in china that make  telecommunications  products  and
several  significant  customers are located in this region as a result of these
and other international operations we face a number of risks including

         major health concerns such as sars
         difficulty of effectively managing our diverse global operations
         change in regulatory requirements
         tariffs  duties  and  other  trade  barriers  including  antidumping
          duties
         undeveloped legal systems and
         political and economic instability in foreign markets

we face risks through our equity method  investments in companies that we do not
control

     cornings net income includes  significant equity in earnings of associated
companies for the year ended december 31 2004 we have recognized 443 million
of equity earnings of which 393 million came from our two largest investments
dow corning  corporation  which makes  silicone  products and samsung  corning
precision glass co ltd  which makes liquid crystal  display glass  samsung
corning precision is located in the asiapacific region and as such is subject
to those geographic risks referred to above with 50 or lower ownership  we do
not  control  such  equity   companies  nor  their  management  and  operations
performance of our equity investments may not continue at the same levels in the
future  during 2003 we recognized charges associated with samsung corning co
ltd our 50 equity method  investment  that makes glass panels and funnels for
conventional  televisions  which recorded  significant  fixed asset impairment
charges  during 2004 we have  recognized  charges  associated with dow corning
corporation  which recorded  charges for  restructuring  actions and bankruptcy
related  settlement  activities  it is possible that future  earnings  could be
negatively  impacted  by  additional  charges  recorded  by  our  equity  method
investments

we face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations

     because we have  significant  customers  and  operations  outside the us
fluctuations in foreign currencies especially the japanese yen and euro affect
our sales and profit levels  foreign  exchange rates may make our products less
competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the
dollar  sales in our display  technologies  segment are denominated in japanese
yen for 2004 the display  technologies  segment  represented  29 of cornings
sales based on the expected sales growth of the display  technologies  segment
our  exposure  to  currency  fluctuations  is  increasing   although  we  hedge
significant transaction risk we do not currently hedge translation risk

if the  financial  condition of our customers  declines  our credit risks could
increase

     we have experienced  and in the future may experience  losses as a result
of our inability to collect our accounts receivable as well as the loss of such
customers  ongoing  business  if our  customers  fail  to meet  their  payment
obligations to us  including  deposits due under longterm  purchase and supply
agreements in our display technologies segment we could experience reduced cash
flows and  losses in  excess of  amounts  reserved  as of  december  31  2004
reserves for trade receivables totaled approximately 30 million

we may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us

     we face the risk of loss resulting from and adverse  publicity  associated
with product liability securities fiduciary liability intellectual property
antitrust contractual  warranty fraud and other lawsuits whether or not such
claims are valid in addition our product liability  fiduciary  directors and
officers  property and  comprehensive  general  liability  insurance may not be
adequate to cover such claims or may not be  available  to the extent we expect
our insurance costs have increased and may increase further  we may not be able
to get  adequate  insurance  coverage  in the  future  at  acceptable  costs  a
successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us
to pay substantial  sums some of the carriers in our excess insurance  programs
are in  liquidation  and may not be able to  respond  if we should  have  claims
reaching  into  excess  layers  the  financial  health  of other  insurers  may
deteriorate  and these  insurers  may not be able to respond  if we should  have
claims  reaching into excess layers  in addition  we may not be able to insure
against  certain risks or obtain some types of  insurance  such as terrorism or
war insurance

months of a decision to do so



item 3  legal proceedings


environmental litigation corning has been named by the environmental protection
agency under the  superfund  act or by state  governments  under  similar state
laws as a potentially  responsible  party at 11 active  hazardous  waste sites
under the  superfund  act all parties who may have  contributed  any waste to a
hazardous  waste site  identified  by such  agency  are jointly and  severally
liable  for the cost of  cleanup  unless  the  agency  agrees  otherwise  it is
cornings  policy to accrue for its  estimated  liability  related to  superfund
sites and other  environmental  liabilities related to property owned by corning
based on expert analysis and continual  monitoring by both internal and external
consultants  corning has accrued  approximately  14 million for its  estimated
liability for  environmental  cleanup and litigation at december 31 2004 based
upon the  information  developed to date  management  believes that the accrued
reserve is a reasonable estimate of the companys liability and that the risk of
an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote

schwinger and stevens  toxins  lawsuits  in april 2002  corning was named as a
defendant in two actions  schwinger  and  stevens  filed in the us  district
court for the eastern  district of new york  which  asserted  various  personal
injury and property  damage  claims  against a number of  corporate  defendants
these  claims  allegedly  arise  from the  release  of toxic  substances  from a
sylvania  nuclear  materials  processing  facility  near  hicksville  new york
amended  complaints  naming 205 plaintiffs  and seeking  damages in excess of 3
billion  were served in  september  2002  the sole basis of  liability  against
corning was plaintiffs claim that corning was the successor to sylvaniacorning
nuclear  corporation  a delaware  corporation  formed in 1957 and  dissolved in
1960  management  intends to vigorously  contest all claims against corning for
the reason that  corning is not the  successor to  sylvaniacorning  management
will also defend on the grounds that almost all of the wrongful death claims and
personal injury claims are timebarred at a status conference in december 2002
the court  decided to  administratively  close the schwinger and stevens cases
and  ordered   plaintiffs   counsel  to  bring  new  amended   complaints  with
bellwether plaintiffs in these actions known as schwinger ii and astuto the
plaintiffs  have not named  corning as a  defendant  although  it appears  that
plaintiffs may proceed only against the other corporate defendants the original
schwinger  and  stevens  cases  remain  pending  and no order  has been  entered
dismissing  corning   based  upon  the  information   developed  to  date  and
recognizing  that the outcome of litigation is  uncertain  management  believes
that the  likelihood  of a  materially  adverse  impact to  cornings  financial
statements is remote

dow  corning  bankruptcy  corning and dow  chemical  each own 50 of the common
stock of dow corning  which was in reorganization  proceedings under chapter 11
of the us  bankruptcy  code between may 1995 and june 2004  dow corning filed
for bankruptcy  protection to address  pending and claimed  liabilities  arising
from many  thousand  breastimplant  product  lawsuits  each of which  typically
sought  damages in excess of one  million  dollars  on  november  8 1998  dow
corning  and the  tort  claimants  committee  jointly  filed a  revised  plan of
reorganization   joint  plan  which  provided  for  the  settlement  or  other
resolution of implant claims after review and approvals by the bankruptcy court
and the us district court of the eastern district of michigan  and an appeal
the district court on april 2 2004 entered an order  establishing  june 1 2004
as the effective date of the joint plan

under the terms of the joint plan dow corning has  established and is funding a
settlement trust and a litigation facility to provide a means for tort claimants
to settle or  litigate  their  claims  of the  approximately  32  billion  of
required funding  dow corning has paid approximately 16 billion inclusive of
insurance  and expects to pay up to an  additional  16 billion  710 million
aftertax over 16 years corning and dow chemical have each agreed to provide a
credit  facility  to dow  corning  of up to 150  million  300  million in the
aggregate  subject to the terms and  conditions  stated in the joint plan  as
required by the joint plan  dow corning has fully  satisfied  or reserved for
the claims of its  commercial  creditors  in  accordance  with a march 31  2004
ruling of the district court determining the amount of pendency interest allowed
on the 810 million in principal owing on such claims  in the second quarter of
2004  dow corning  recorded a 47 million  pretax  adjustment  to its interest
liabilities  relating  to this  matter  corning  recognized  14 million in its
second  quarter  equity  earnings  for its after  tax share of this  adjustment
certain  commercial  creditors  have appealed  that ruling to the us  court of
appeals of the sixth  circuit  seeking  from dow  corning an  additional  sum of
approximately  80 million for interest at default rates and enforcement  costs
corning  believes  the risk of loss to dow  corning  net of sums  reserved  is
remote

in addition  dow corning has received a statutory notice of deficiency from the
united states  internal  revenue  service  asserting tax  deficiencies  totaling
approximately  653 million  relating to its federal income tax returns for the
1995 and 1996 calendar  years  this matter is pending before the us  district
court in michigan  dow corning has also received a proposed adjustment from the
irs  approximately  1169  million  with  respect to its  federal  income tax
returns for the 1997  1998 and 1999 calendar  years  dow corning is vigorously
contesting  these  deficiencies and proposed  adjustments  which it believes are
excessive

in 1995  corning  fully  impaired its  investment in dow corning upon its entry
into  bankruptcy  proceedings and did not recognize net equity earnings from the
second quarter of 1995 through the end of 2002 corning began recognizing equity
earnings  in the  first  quarter  of 2003  when  management  concluded  that its
emergence  from  bankruptcy  protection  was  probable  corning  considers  the
difference  between the carrying  value of its investment in dow corning and its
50 share of dow  cornings  equity to be  permanent  this  difference  is 249
million subject to future rulings by the bankruptcy court and potential changes
in estimated bankruptcyrelated liabilities it is possible that dow corning may
record bankruptcyrelated charges in the future

corning  received  no  dividends  from dow  corning in 2004 or in 2003  corning
anticipates that dow corning will begin to pay dividends in 2005

the joint plan includes releases for corning and dow chemical as shareholders in
exchange  for  contributions  to the joint  plan  although  claims  against the
shareholders  were included in several thousand state and federal lawsuits filed
prebankruptcy  alleging  injuries arising from dow cornings implant products
corning  was awarded  summary  judgment  in federal  court and in several  state
jurisdictions  the remaining  claims  against  corning will be channeled by the
joint plan into facilities  established by the joint plan  management  believes
that the  likelihood  of a  materially  adverse  impact to  cornings  financial
statements arising from these remaining claims against shareholders is remote

federal securities cases a federal securities class action lawsuit was filed in
1992 in the us  district  court for the southern  district of new york against
corning and certain individual defendants the action was brought in the name of
a class of  purchasers  of  corning  stock  who  allege  misrepresentations  and
omissions of material facts relative to the silicone gel breast implant business
conducted by dow corning  the nominal  class  consisted of those  purchasers of
corning stock in the period from june 14 1989 to january 13 1992 no amount of
damages  was  specified  in the  complaint  in 1997  the court  dismissed  the
individual  defendants  from the case  on december 21 2004  the court granted
summary  judgment  in  favor of  corning  dismissing  all  claims  against  it
plaintiffs  may file an  appeal to the us  court of  appeals  based  upon the
information  developed to date and recognizing that the outcome of litigation is
uncertain  management  believes  that the  likelihood  of a materially  adverse
impact to cornings financial statements is remote

pittsburgh corning  corporation  corning and ppg industries  inc ppg each
own 50 of the capital stock of pcc over a period of more than two decades pcc
and several  other  defendants  have been named in numerous  lawsuits  involving
claims alleging  personal  injury from exposure to asbestos  on april 16 2000
pcc filed for chapter 11  reorganization  in the us  bankruptcy  court for the
western district of pennsylvania as of the bankruptcy filing pcc had in excess
of 140000 open claims and had  insufficient  remaining  insurance and assets to
deal  with its  alleged  current  and  future  liabilities  more  than  100000
additional  claims have been filed with pcc after its  bankruptcy  filing  as a
result of pccs bankruptcy  filing  corning recorded an aftertax charge of 36
million  in  2001  to  fully  impair  its  investment  in pcc  and  discontinued
recognition of equity earnings at the time pcc filed for bankruptcy protection
there were  approximately  12400 claims pending  against corning in state court
lawsuits  alleging  various  theories  of  liability  based on exposure to pccs
asbestos  products and typically  requesting  monetary  damages in excess of one
million dollars per claim corning has defended those claims on the basis of the
separate  corporate status of pcc and the absence of any facts supporting claims
of direct  liability  arising  from  pccs  asbestos  products  corning is also
currently  named in  approximately  11400  other  cases  approximately  43400
claims alleging  injuries from asbestos and similar amounts of monetary damages
per claim those cases have been covered by insurance without material impact to
corning to date asbestos litigation is inherently difficult and past trends in
resolving these claims may not be indicators of future outcomes

in the  bankruptcy  court  pcc in april 2000 obtained a preliminary  injunction
against the prosecution of asbestos  actions arising from pccs products against
its two  shareholders  to afford  the  parties a period of time the  injunction
period in which to negotiate a plan of reorganization for pcc pcc plan

on may 14 2002  ppg announced that it had agreed with certain of its insurance
carriers and  representatives  of current and future  asbestos  claimants on the
terms of a  settlement  arrangement  applicable  to claims  arising  from  pccs
products

on march 28 2003  corning  announced  that it had also reached  agreement with
representatives  of  current  and  future  asbestos  claimants  on a  settlement
arrangement that was thereafter  incorporated into the pcc plan this settlement
remains  subject  to a  number  of  contingencies  including  approval  by  the
bankruptcy court  cornings  settlement will require the  contribution  if the
plan is  approved  and becomes  effective  of its equity  interest in pcc  its
onehalf  equity interest in pce and 25 million shares of corning common stock
the settlement also requires  corning to make cash payments of 144 million net
present  value as of december 31 2004 in six  installments  beginning one year
after the plan is effective  in addition  corning will assign policy rights or
proceeds  under primary  insurance  from 1962 through 1984 as well as rights to
proceeds under certain excess  insurance  most of which falls within the period
from 1962 through 1973 in return for these  contributions  corning  expects to
receive a release and an injunction channeling asbestos claims against it into a
settlement trust under the pcc plan

corning  recorded an initial  charge of 298 million in the period  ending march
31 2003 to reflect the settlement terms  however the amount of the charge for
this  settlement  requires  adjustment  each  quarter  based  upon  movement  in
cornings  common stock price prior to  contribution of the shares to the trust
during  2004   corning  recorded  a  charge  of  33  million  to  reflect  the
marktomarket of corning common stock beginning with the first quarter of 2003
and  through  december  31  2004  corning  recorded  total net charges of 446
million  to reflect  the  initial  settlement  and  marktomarket  the value of
corning common stock

two of cornings  primary  insurers and several  excess  insurers have commenced
litigation for a declaration of the rights and  obligations of the parties under
insurance  policies  including  rights that may be  affected by the  settlement
arrangement  described  above  corning is  vigorously  contesting  these cases
management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation

additional  round of briefing to address  current  case law  developments  with
briefs due on  february  28  2005 and march 10  2005  leading to a hearing on
march 16 2005  the timing and outcome are uncertain  if the bankruptcy  court
does not  confirm the pcc plan in its current  form  changes to the  settlement
agreement are reasonably  possible  further  judicial review is also reasonably
possible  although the  confirmation  of the pcc plan is subject to a number of
contingencies  apart from the  quarterly  adjustment in the value of 25 million
shares of corning  common stock  management  believes that the  likelihood of a

item 7 managements  discussion and analysis of financial condition and results

of operations


overview

we  continued  to focus on three  significant  priorities  in 2004  protect our
financial  health  improve  profitability  and invest in our  future  we made
significant progress towards all three in 2004

financial health

during 2004 we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and delivered positive
cash flows for the year the following are key accomplishments for 2004

    as part of a debt reduction  program  we retired 487 million of longterm
     debt additionally  we repaid 115 million of debt primarily attributable
     to certain bondholders exercising their early repayment option
    we issued 400  million of  longterm  debt  the proceeds of which will be
     used to repay debt  fund capital  expenditures  and extend the duration of
     our debt portfolio
    we reduced  our dsos to 52 days  compared  to 58 days as of  december  31
     2003 this was  accomplished  through the  negotiation of improved  payment
     terms with customers primarily in the display technologies segment
    negotiated  multiyear  supply  agreements  with  customers  in the display
     technologies segment  including the receipt of deposits against orders to
     meet the rapid growth of the liquid  crystal  display lcd market  during
     2004 we received deposits totaling 204 million under such agreements
    we generated  sufficient cash flows from operating  activities to cover our
     capital expenditures

we ended  2004  with 19  billion  in cash  cash  equivalents  and  shortterm
investments this represents an increase of 615 million from december 31 2003
we  continue  to have  unrestricted  access  to a 2  billion  revolving  credit
facility  and have 25 billion of capacity under our existing  universal shelf
registration statement our revolving credit facility expires in august 2005 we
are currently in negotiations with leading  financial  institutions to arrange a
credit  facility  and believe a new facility will be executed in the first half
of 2005 we believe we have  sufficient  liquidity for the next several years to
fund operations capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments

profitability

although 2004 resulted in a net loss of 2165  million  this included a number
of charges that are not anticipated to recur in the future and is therefore not
indicative of our projections for  profitability  in 2005 the most  significant
charges included in our net loss were

    goodwill and asset impairment  charges of 1746 million  primarily in our
     telecommunications segment
    an increase in our provision for income taxes of 937 million caused by our
     decision to record a  valuation  allowance  against  certain  deferred  tax
     assets

the goodwill and fixed asset impairment  charges were triggered from the results
of our annual  strategic  planning  process of the  telecommunications  segment
specifically  we determined that we needed to lower our estimates and forecasts
for the longterm revenue growth of the telecommunications  segment although we
are currently  experiencing  stronger than expected volume in this segment  the
improved demand comes from a narrow band of customers and we see few signs of a
broader recovery in overall demand mix of premium products and pricing for our
products the lack of industry consolidation increased competitive pressures in
the industry  and revised  estimates of future customer demand for the types of
products they will deploy have caused us to change our  assessment of the future
pace of recovery the primary estimates and forecasts driving this change in our
outlook are

    revised  estimates  of future  pricing for fiber and cable  pricing in the
     telecommunications industry remains depressed as the industry has failed to
     reduce capacity  our previous  projections assumed some rationalization of
     capacity that would lead to more stable pricing  we now expect the current
     depressed pricing conditions to persist into 2005 and beyond
    revised estimates of demand for premium fiber product based on competitive
     conditions and projected future customer requirements  we do not expect to
     achieve  the level of demand  for  premium  fiber  products  we  previously
     forecasted  although we have introduced innovative products to the market
     we have not been able to obtain  the  historical  premium  prices  for such
     products additionally  demand for premium fiber has declined as there are
     fewer longhaul  projects  as a result we have significantly  reduced our
     outlook for future revenue and profitability from premium products  we now
     do not  expect  any  significant  increase  in  premium  fiber  mix for the
     foreseeable future
    revised  estimates for the longterm  worldwide market volume growth as we
     project customer  demand  we have lowered the rate of volume growth in the
     longer range


page



as a result of the  impairment  charges  and  lower  longterm  outlook  for our
telecommunication  segment  we have  also  concluded  that we  must  provide  a
valuation  allowance  against  certain of our deferred tax assets in  accordance
with financial  accounting  standards  board  statement of financial  accounting
standard sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes sfas 109 the valuation
allowance  relates to our domestic  us  federal  state and local and german
deferred tax assets we have incurred significant losses in the us and germany
due primarily to the telecommunications restructuring and impairment charges and
operating losses over the last four years although cornings  profitability has
improved  over the last  several  quarters  a growing  portion of our sales and
earnings is outside of the us  particularly in asia the us  portion of our
operations  operated at a loss in 2004  this portion not only  includes most of
our  telecommunications  segment  but also a significant  portion of our global
research  development and engineering and corporate infrastructure spending as
we have taken additional  significant impairment charges and lowered our outlook
for our largest us based business during the third quarter  we believe that a
valuation  allowance  against these tax assets is required until  realization is
more assured  we remain  committed to return to  profitability  in the us and
germany so that we will be able to use these  deferred  tax assets  before  they
expire  in  general  us  tax  laws  allow 20  years  to use  operating  loss
carryforwards

the above  charges  more than  offset  the  significant  earnings  growth in our
display  technologies  segment and the gross margin improvements  resulting from
restructuring  actions taken in 2003 most notably the exit of the  conventional
television  and  photonics  businesses  we remain  confident  in our ability to
execute our plans and return to profitability in 2005

investing in our future

we remain  committed  to  investing in  innovation  we are  investing in a wide
variety of technologies  with our focus being glass substrates for active matrix
lcds diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening  emissions control
standards and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that will
enable fibertothepremises

our research development and engineering expenditures have moderately increased
compared to 2003  we believe our  spending  levels are  adequate to support our
growth strategies

we also  remain  committed  to  investing  in  manufacturing  capacity  to match
increased  demand in our  businesses  our capital  expenditures  are  primarily
focused on  expanding  manufacturing  capacity for lcd glass  substrates  in the
display   technologies   segment  and  diesel  products  in  the   environmental
technologies segment  total capital expenditures for 2004 were 857 million of
which 640 million was directed toward our display technologies segment and 124
million in  anticipation  of the  emerging  market for diesel  emission  control
systems

we expect our 2005  capital  spending to be in the range of 12 billion to 14
billion  of which 900  million to 11  billion  will be  directed  toward our
display  technologies  segment and  approximately  140 million will be directed
toward our environmental technologies segment

net sales

the net  sales  increase  in 2004 was the  result  of  strong  demand  for glass
substrates  in  our  display  technologies  segment  demand  for  hardware  and
equipment products in our  telecommunications  segment  and improvements across
the majority of our other businesses  these  improvements were partially offset
by the 2003 exit of our photonic technologies and us  conventional  television
glass  businesses  movements in foreign exchange rates  primarily the japanese
yen and euro did not  significantly  impact the comparison of net sales between
2004 and 2003

the net sales  decline  in 2003 was  primarily  due to the exit of the  photonic
technologies and us  conventional  television  glass  businesses  during 2003
based on the exchange  rates at the beginning of 2003  our sales were favorably
impacted  by the  weakening  us  dollar  against  the  yen  and  the  euro  by
approximately 3

reflecting  the  growth in our  display  technologies  segment  net sales  into
international  markets are  increasing at a faster rate than those into the us
market  for 2004  sales into  international  markets  accounted for 65 of net
sales while  sales to the us  market  accounted  for 35  for 2003  sales to
international  markets  accounted  for 60 of net sales  while sales to the us
market for 40

gross margin

as a  percentage  of net sales  gross  margin  improved 10 points in 2004  the
improvement in overall gross margin dollars and as a percentage of net sales was
driven by a net sales growth in the display  technologies  segment of 87 b
operating efficiencies in our  telecommunications  segment and c the 2003 exit
of the conventional television glass business


page



for 2003  gross margins  improved eight points  this improvement was primarily
the  result  of lower  costs  resulting  from our 2002  restructuring  programs
primarily in the telecommunications  segment gross margin improved in all other
reportable segments  however the gains achieved were partially offset by a 13
million  writedown  of inventory  related to the exit of the us  conventional
television business

selling general and administrative expenses

the 2004 increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily
driven by increases in  compensation  costs  for 2003 the decrease in selling
general and  administrative  expenses  reflects cost savings  primarily from the
2003 and 2002 restructuring actions

research development and engineering expenses

research  development and engineering  expenditures increased modestly in 2004
but the focus of our spending has shifted  from  telecommunications  projects to
display  technologies  projects   expenditures  on  environmental  technologies
projects  have  remained  relatively  constant  and  spending  on life  sciences
projects has increased 10 million  the 2003 decrease reflects the cost savings
that resulted  from the 2002  restructuring  actions  including the closure and
consolidation of research facilities

     impairment of goodwill
     

     2004 impairment charge

     pursuant to sfas no 142  goodwill and other  intangible  assets  sfas
     142  goodwill  is  required  to be tested for  impairment  annually at the
     reporting unit level in addition goodwill should be tested for impairment
     between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances  change that would
     more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting  unit below its
     related  carrying value our annual goodwill  recoverability  assessment is
     completed in the fourth quarter as it is traditionally based on our annual
     strategic  planning  process  that runs from june to october  this process
     includes reviewing  expectations for the longterm growth of our businesses
     and  forecasting  future cash flows  in the third  quarter  we identified
     certain factors during this annual  strategic  planning process that caused
     us to lower our estimates and projections for the longterm  revenue growth
     of the telecommunications  segment which indicated that it was more likely
     than not that the fair value of the  telecommunications  segment  reporting
     unit was less than its  carrying  value  as such  we performed an interim
     impairment  test of the  telecommunications  segment  goodwill in the third
     quarter of 2004 the results of which were reviewed with cornings board of
     directors on october 6 2004

     we  estimated  the fair  value of the  telecommunications  segment  using a
     discounted cash flow model based on our current estimates for the longterm
     growth of the telecommunications segment and concluded that the fair value
     of  the   telecommunications   segment  was  below  its  carrying   amount
     accordingly  we recorded an impairment  charge of 1420 million to reduce
     the carrying value of goodwill to its estimated fair value  we updated our
     telecommunications  segment goodwill test in the fourth quarter the result
     of the test  concluded  that the fair value of the reporting  unit exceeded
     its book value

     2002 impairment charge

     in the fourth quarter of 2002 we conducted our annual impairment tests and
     concluded that an impairment charge of 400 million was necessary to reduce
     the carrying value of goodwill in the telecommunications  reporting unit to
     its estimated fair value of 16 billion the decrease in fair value at the
     end of 2002 from that  measured  in the  initial  benchmark  assessment  on
     january 1 2002 primarily reflected the following

         a delay in the timing of the  expected  recovery  from late  2002  or
          early 2003 to 2005
         a reduction in the shortterm cash flow  expectations of the fiber and
          cable business and a lower base from which the expected  recovery will
          occur and
         a reduction in the short and longterm cash flow  expectations  of the
          photonic technologies product line

     we  retained  valuation  specialists  to  assist  in the  valuation  of our
     tangible and identifiable  intangible assets for the purpose of determining
     the implied fair value of goodwill at december 31 2002

     impairment of longlived assets other than goodwill
     

     given our  restructuring  actions  and the  market  conditions  facing  our
     businesses  at  various  times  throughout  2002  to  2004  we  performed
     evaluations of the  recoverability  of our held for use  longlived  assets
     other  than  goodwill  in each  case  that an  impairment  evaluation  was
     required  we developed expected future cash flows against which to compare
     the carrying value of the asset group being  evaluated  if our projections
     indicated  that our long lived assets were not  recoverable  through future
     cash  flows  we were  then  required  to  estimate  the fair  value of the
     longlived  assets  which were limited to property  plant and  equipment
     using the expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value

     2004 impairment charge

     assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment

     these charges comprise the following
         telecommunications  segment in 2004 we recorded a net charge of 344
          million to impair plant and equipment related to certain facilities to
          be disposed of or  shutdown  approximately  332  million of this net
          charge  is  comprised  of  the  partially  completed  sections  of our
          concord  nc  optical  fiber  facility  as a result of our  lowered
          outlook  we have permanently  abandoned this construction in progress
          as we no longer  believe the demand for optical fiber will warrant the
          investment necessary to complete this facility  corning will continue
          to mothball and depreciate the separate previouslyoperated portion of
          the concord fiber facility

         other  businesses  we recorded net credits of 42 million  primarily
          for  gains on the sale of  assets  of  corning  asahi  video  products
          company  cav  sold to a  third  party  in  china  this  represented
          proceeds  in excess of assumed  salvage  values for assets  previously
          impaired in july 2004 we completed the sale of cavs assets

     assets to be held and used

     due to our decision to  permanently  abandon  certain  assets and lower our
     longterm  outlook  for the  telecommunications  segment  during  the third
     quarter of 2004 we determined  that an event of impairment had occurred in
     our  telecommunications  segment  which  required us to test the  segments
     longlived  assets other than goodwill for impairment  as a result of this
     impairment  evaluation  we recorded a 24 million impairment charge in the
     third quarter of 2004 to writedown certain assets to fair value

     2003 impairment charge

     assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment

     these charges comprise the following
         telecommunications  segment  we  recorded  charges of 24  million to
          impair plant and equipment  related to the shutdown of a cabling plant
          and the final exit of the photonic technologies  business the charges
          were more than  offset by a 61  million  credit  related to  previous
          restructuring plans  primarily the result of decision not to exit two
          of the cable sites previously marked for shutdown in 2002

         other  businesses  we  recorded  charges  of 78  million  primarily
          related to our decision to shutdown  cav and the closure of our north
          brookfield semiconductor materials plant

     2002 impairment charges

     assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment

     in 2002 in  connection  with the  restructuring  actions we recorded a net
     charge of 701 million related to facilities to be shut down or dispose of
     and the  abandonment of certain  construction  projects  these net charges
     were  primarily  related  to the  telecommunications  segment  and  certain
     research facilities

     assets to be held and used

     these charges comprise the following
         telecommunications  segment  in 2002 the  telecommunications  market
          underwent  a  dramatic  decline in demand  for its  products  as major
          buyers of network  equipment in this  industry  reduced  their capital
          spending  as a result of our  impairment  evaluation  the  photonics
          assets were written down to estimated  salvage  value  as this amount
          was our best  estimate of fair value  this resulted in a 269 million
          writedown of the longlived  assets  including 90 million related to
          patents

         other  businesses  in 2002  the market was  impacted by a decline in
          demand for conventional  television  glass and a dramatic  increase in
          the  importation of television  glass  tubes and sets from asia as a
          result of our impairment evaluation cavs assets were written down to
          their  estimated  fair  values   this  resulted  in  a  140  million
          writedown of the assets

asbestos settlement

on  march  28  2003  we  announced  that we had  reached  agreement  with  the
representatives  of asbestos  claimants  for the  settlement  of all current and
future   nonpremises   asbestos  claims  against  us  and  pittsburgh   corning
corporation pcc which might arise from pcc products or operations

the agreement is expected to be incorporated into a settlement fund as part of a
reorganization  plan for pcc the plan was  submitted to the federal  bankruptcy
court at the end of 2003 received a favorable vote from creditor classes in the
first quarter of 2004  but remains  subject to a number of  contingencies  the
bankruptcy  court has allowed an additional round of briefing to address current
case law developments  with briefs due on february 28 2005 and march 10 2005
leading  to a  hearing  on march 16  2005  the  timing  and  outcome  of these
proceedings are uncertain if the bankruptcy court does not confirm the pcc plan
in  its  current  form  changes  to the  settlement  agreement  are  reasonably
possible further judicial review is also reasonably possible our contributions
to the settlement  trust under the agreement are not required unless the plan is
approved becomes effective and is no longer subject to appeal

if the plan becomes  effective  our settlement will require the contribution of
our equity interest in pcc our onehalf  equity interest in pittsburgh  corning
europe nv pce  and 25 million shares of our common stock  the common stock
will be markedtomarket  each quarter until it is contributed to the settlement
trust  thus resulting in adjustments to income and the settlement  liability as
appropriate  we will  also  make cash  payments  with a  current  value of 144
million over six years beginning one year after the plan becomes  effective  in
addition  we will assign insurance  policy proceeds from our primary  insurance
and a portion of our excess insurance as part of the settlement

provision benefit for income taxes

our provision  benefit for income taxes and the related effective income tax
benefit rates were as follows in millions

                                          for the years ended december 31
                                       
                                          2004          2003            2002

provision benefit for income taxes      1031       254             726
effective income tax benefit rate         653        334           267


the  effective  income tax benefit rate for 2004  2003 and 2002 differed from
the us  statutory  rate of 35  primarily  due to increases  in the  valuation
allowance against certain domestic us  federal  state and local and foreign
deferred  tax  assets  and  for 2004  only  the  writeoff  of  nondeductible
goodwill

during  2004  we  increased  our tax expense by 937 million as a result of our
decision to establish a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our
deferred tax assets primarily in the us and germany we reached this decision
by  performing  a review of all positive and  negative  evidence  regarding  the
realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 109 this
assessment  included  the  evaluation  of  scheduled  reversals  of deferred tax
liabilities  estimates  of projected  future  taxable  income and  taxplanning
strategies  as well as  related  key  assumptions  sfas  109  requires  that a
valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a
portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized  sfas 109 further requires
that greater weight be given to previous cumulative losses than the outlook for
future profitability when determining whether deferred tax assets can be used

we have incurred significant losses in the us and germany due primarily to the
restructuring   and   impairment   charges   and   operating   losses   in   our
telecommunications  segment  over the last four years  as a result of the third
quarter of 2004 impairment charges and the lowering of our longterm outlook for
the  telecommunications  segment  our  largest  us  and german  business  we
concluded that a valuation  allowance  against  certain  deferred tax assets was
required


page



we expect to  maintain a valuation  allowance  on future tax  benefits  until an
appropriate  level of  profitability  primarily  in the us  and  germany  is
sustained  or we are able to develop tax planning  strategies  that enable us to
conclude  that it is more likely than not that a larger  portion of our deferred
tax assets would be realizable  or if the pcc  settlement is finalized  earlier
than we anticipate  until then our tax provision will include only the net tax
expense  attributable  to certain  foreign  operations  refer to note 6 income
taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

2004 vs 2003

the 2004 sales increase is largely  reflective of the overall lcdmarket growth
during 2004  glass  substrate  volumes  measured in square feet of glass sold
increased  approximately  65  sales also  benefited  from modest average price
increases  primarily  the  result  of a change  in  product  mix as the  market
continues to trend toward large size glass  substrates  generation 5 and above
which carry a higher  selling  price per square  foot  the sales of the display
technologies  segment are denominated in japanese yen and as such our revenues
are  susceptible  to movements  in the us dollar  japanese yen exchange  rates
sales  benefited  by  approximately  10 from a  weakening  of the  us  dollar
compared to 2003

for 2004 the key drivers for the increase in income before equity earnings were
the impact of incremental volumes and efficiencies realized through the shift in
production toward large size glass  substrates  movements in exchange rates did
not have a significant impact on income before equity earnings  the increase in
our equity  earnings from samsung  corning  precision were largely driven by the
same factors identified for our whollyowned business

the display  technologies  segment  manufactures and sells glass substrates to a
concentrated  customer base comprised of lcd panel makers  primarily  located in
japan  and  taiwan  the  most  significant   customers  in  these  markets  are
au optronics  corp  chi mei  optoelectronics  corp  hannstar  display corp
quanta display inc  sharp  corporation  and toppan cfi taiwan co ltd lcd
panels are used in computer  products  such as notebook  computers  and desktop
monitors  consumer electronics products such as digital cameras and camcorders
and car  navigation  systems  and  lcd  televisions  in  2004  these  six lcd
customers  accounted  for 76 of the  display  technologies  segment  sales  in
addition  samsung corning precisions sales were also concentrated  with three
lcd panel makers in korea  samsung  electronics  co ltd lg philips lcd co
and boe hydis technology co ltd accounting for 88 of sales

corning and these  customers  have  typically  entered  into  multiyear  supply
agreements  for the  purchase  and sale of glass  substrates  these  agreements
provide for corning to supply a percentage of the  customers  requirements  and
include  mechanisms for forecasting and ordering  during 2004 corning improved
the payment  terms under these  agreements  to improve  cash flow and reduce its
working capital requirements


page



we expect the lcd market to  continue  to grow  rapidly  we  anticipate  higher
demand for lcd  televisions  for which our lcd  customers  require  larger size
glass  substrates  during 2004  corning held  discussions  with several of its
customers  to  discuss  how to meet  this  demand  as part of its  discussions
corning has sought improved payment terms including deposits against orders to
provide a greater degree of assurance that we are effectively  building capacity
to meet the needs of a rapidly growing industry  there can be no assurance that
corning will be able to pace its capacity expansion to the actual demand  while
the  industry  has  grown  rapidly  the  pace of  growth  may be  less  than we
anticipate  and it is possible  that glass  manufacturing  capacity  may exceed
demand during certain periods

in 2004  corning and a taiwanese customer entered into a longterm purchase and
supply  agreement  as amended in which the display  technologies  segment will
supply  lcd  glass  to the  customer  over a  fiveyear  period  as part of the
agreement  the  customer  will make  advance  cash  deposits of 460 million to
corning  through  2006 for a portion of the  contracted  glass to be  purchased
corning  received a total of 204 million of deposits against orders in 2004 and
expects to receive an additional 171 million in 2005  refer to note 1 summary
of  significant  accounting  policies  and note 10 other  liabilities  to the
consolidated financial statements for further information

in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  corning  will  continue  to  negotiate
multiyear supply agreements with its large customers where feasible

2003 vs 2002

the 2003 sales increase was primarily due to volume gains of approximately  43
as penetration of liquid crystal display panels in the desktop market increased
and favorable exchange rates earnings approximately doubled in 2003 compared to
the prior year due to the  increase  in volume and  significant  gains in equity
earnings from samsung corning precision over the prior year

in july 2003  we  announced  a 180  million  expansion  of our liquid  crystal
display glass manufacturing facility in taiwan

outlook
we expect to see a  continuation  of the overall  industry  growth and the trend
toward  large  size  substrates  we  continue  to see  positive  trends  in the
penetration rates of lcds into the endmarkets  notebook  computers  monitors
and televisions  and increasing  demand for the large size substrates  volume
growth for the lcd market is  anticipated to be between 40 and 60 in 2005 and
we anticipate  adding  sufficient  capacity to meet market  growth  this market
growth will occur at varying rates in the principal lcd markets of japan taiwan
and  korea   sales  of  our  whollyowned   business  are  primarily  to  panel
manufacturers  in japan and taiwan with  customers  in korea  being  serviced by
samsung corning precision  the actual growth rates in these markets will impact
our sales and earnings performance for 2005 we are anticipating price declines
after two years of price stability as competitors bring on additional  capacity
we also anticipate our costs will continue to decline there can be no assurance
that the endmarket rates of growth will continue at the high rates  experienced
in recent years or that the rate of cost declines will offset price  declines in
any given period  consumer  preferences for panels of differing sizes or price
or other  factors  may lead to pauses in market  growth from time to time  for
2005 cornings rate of sales growth is expected to be higher in the second half
of the year based on anticipated  increases in panel manufacturers  capacity to
meet the anticipated market demands for lcd televisions we expect net income in
the segment to increase  significantly in 2005 based on the strong volume growth
in our whollyowned  business and increased equity earnings from samsung corning
precision

2004 vs 2003

during 2004 we experienced a stabilization of the  telecommunications  industry
fiber volumes grew at a stronger than  anticipated  18 but pricing declined by
9 from 2003 levels although we are encouraged by the volume growth the demand
comes from a narrow band of customers  and we do not view this as the  beginning
of a broader  recovery in the  industry  the primary  driver for the 2004 sales
growth  was  verizon  communications  fibertothepremises  project  in  north
america  with  the  most  significant  benefit  realized  in our  hardware  and
equipment products during 2004 one customer accounted for 13 of total segment
sales and 10 customers accounted for 47 of total segment sales

offsetting this sales performance were the following items
    during 2003 we  completed  the sale and exit of our  photonic  technologies
     business
    on  september  1  2004 we  completed  the sale of our  frequency  controls
     business this business had 2003 annual sales of 76 million
    sales in japan were down in 2004  largely due to 2003  projects  that were
     not repeated in 2004

movements in foreign  exchange  rates  primarily the japanese yen and euro did
not have a significant impact on 2004 sales compared to 2003

in  june  2004  the  chinese   ministry  of  commerce  issued  an  antidumping
preliminary  determination  asserting that corning had dumped optical fiber into
china  during 2002 and 2003 and imposed a 16 duty on  cornings  optical  fiber
imports corning contested this preliminary determination and in december 2004
the ministry of commerce  concluded  that corning had not dumped  optical  fiber
into china and the 16 duty was removed

the increased net loss for 2004 is primarily attributable to the goodwill fixed
asset and equity method  investments  impairment  charges  recorded in the third
quarter of 2004  refer to  results  of  continuing  operations  for  additional
information on these charges

2003 vs 2002

the   2003   sales   decrease   is   primarily   attributable   to  the   global
telecommunications  market  downturn  that  continued  into 2003  overall fiber
volumes increased 11 and pricing pressures  continued with overall declines of
31  the lack of capital  spending by our  customers  negatively  affected  all
product  lines  and the sale of our appliance  controls  group further  reduced
hardware and equipment  sales  also during 2003 we completed the sale and exit
of our photonic  technologies  business  partially  offsetting  this was strong
demand for optical  fiber and cable  products in japan and china  2003  volumes
benefited  from  having  the full year  results of the  chinese  fiber and cable
entities acquired from lucent technologies in the fourth quarter of 2002

outlook
we  expect  sales  in 2005 to  increase  over  2004  we  expect  the  worldwide
telecommunications  industry market to grow  particularly in north america but
still do not view this as the beginning of a broadbased  industry recovery  we
expect fiber volumes to increase  modestly and pricing pressures should again be
moderate  sales  improvement  will largely be dependent on the  continuation of
verizons fibertothepremises project and should these plans not occur at the
pace anticipated our sales and earnings would be adversely  affected  we expect
to realize a loss in 2005  although at  significantly  lower  levels than 2004
this  reduction  in  anticipated  segment  loss  is  largely  attributed  to the
impairment  charges  incurred in 2004 as well as the  operational  efficiencies
from increased volumes in 2005

2004 vs 2003

the 2004  increase  in net sales is  primarily  the  result  of  demand  for our
automotive and diesel  ceramic  filters and substrates in response to tightening
emissions  control  standards  around  the  world  volumes  for our  automotive
products were up slightly from 2003 and sales benefited from a higher mix of our
thinwall and ultra thinwall  substrates  which allow engine  manufacturers to
meet their emissions control  requirements in a more cost effective manner  our
diesel  products  sales  growth was  primarily  driven by demand  from  retrofit
markets  although we experienced a softening in asian  retrofit  markets in the
second half of 2004  a portion of the sales of the  environmental  technologies
segment are  susceptible to movements in the us  dollareuro  exchange  rates
movements in exchange rates did not have a significant  impact on sales for 2004
compared to 2003

the environmental  technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of
manufacturers  of emission  control  systems  who then sell to  automotive  and
diesel  engine  manufacturers  although our sales are to the  emission  control
systems  manufacturers  the use of our  substrates  and filters  are  generally
required  by  the   specifications   of  the   automotive   and  diesel   engine
manufacturers  for 2004  four  customers  accounted  for 69 of total  segment
sales

the 2004 decline in net income is primarily the result of increased  development
costs and plant startup costs to support our emerging  diesel  products  these
costs offset the gross margin  benefits of increased  volumes and the higher mix
of  premium   automotive   products   movements  in  exchange   rates  did  not
significantly impact net income

2003 vs 2002

the 2003  increase  in net  sales  was  primarily  due to  increased  us  auto
production  driven by financing  incentives  favorable mix of premium products
favorable  exchange rates and higher sales for diesel  products  the net income
decrease was primarily due to a decrease in equity  earnings from  cormetech  a
us designer and manufacturer of industrial  catalysts  and higher development
spending for the diesel product line

outlook
we expect sales to increase in 2005 for automotive  products  we expect to see
stable demand based on anticipated worldwide auto production and a continuation
of a shift to premium  products  although at slightly  slower  rates than 2004
although  volumes are anticipated to be stable  a slowdown in auto  production
particularly in north america  could adversely  impact our growth  projections
diesel  product sales are also expected to grow  demand for diesel  products in
2005 will be largely based on retrofit markets  and we expect a recovery of the
asian  market  during  the year  in 2005  we must  successfully  complete  the
development  of our diesel  technology  and have our filters  designed  into the
specifications  of engine  manufacturers to meet anticipated  demand in 2006 and
beyond as diesel  engine  manufacturers  ramp up  production  for the 2007 model
years the retrofit market is somewhat volatile  and any unanticipated declines
in demand could adversely impact our expected 2005 sales growth  net income for
the  segment is expected  to  increase  only  slightly in 2005 as we continue to
spend heavily on research development and engineering for diesel products

life sciences



the  following  table  provides  net sales and other data for the life  sciences
segment dollars in millions

                                                                                                             change

2004 vs 2003

the 2004 increase in net sales is primarily due to volume  increases  across the
majority of our product lines demand from research  development and production
endusers  remained steady for 2004  which  represented an improvement over the
industrywide softness experienced in 2003 movements in foreign exchange rates
primarily the euro did not have a significant impact on sales for 2004 compared
to 2003


page



the life  sciences  segment sells to a  concentrated  customer  base  primarily
distributors  who  in  turn  sell  to  endusers  such  as  pharmaceutical  and
biotechnology  companies  government entities  academic institutions and other
research  facilities  for 2004  two  distributors  accounted  for 56 of total
segment sales one of these  distributors  communicated its intent to change its
ongoing business strategy in the second half of 2004 subsequent to december 31
2004  corning  notified  this  distributor  that we will not renew its existing
distribution  agreement  which will expire in april 2005  approximately 30 of
life  sciences  2004 sales were made through this  distributor  we are actively
working to  transition  the sales  through  this  distributor  to our  remaining
primary distributor and other existing and developing  channels  however  this
change will likely adversely impact sales volumes in the short term

the 2004  decrease  in net  income  is  largely  attributable  to  gross  margin
improvements  resulting  from the increase in sales  volume being  substantially
offset  by new  product  development  costs  in  addition  in 2003 net  income
benefited  from a gain  recognized on the  disposition  of a minor product line
movement in exchange rates did not significantly impact net income

2003 vs 2002

sales were flat in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to weak sales in europe
and a general  softness in the market  earnings  were down 44  compared to the
prior year improved manufacturing  efficiencies  and a gain on the disposition
of a minor product line were more than offset by higher development spending

outlook
we expect to see a  continuation  of the research  development  and  production
spending in the life sciences market sales will likely be adversely impacted by
as  much  as  10  to 20 by the  recent  changes  in the  distribution  channel
described  above  particularly  in the us  net income for 2005 is expected to
decline  from 2004 levels  largely due to increases in new product  development
and commercialization  expenditures and the anticipated impact of the changes in
distribution channel

growth in 2004  primarily for  semiconductor  lens glass  we do not expect the
pace of growth to continue into 2005  the 2004 decrease in  conventional  video
components  sales is due to our  2003  decision  along  with  our  partner  to
shutdown cav the 2003 decrease in net sales is primarily due to the shutdown of
cav and  weak  demand  for  semiconductor  lens  glass  due to  softness  in the

liquidity and capital resources

financing structure

during 2004 we engaged in the following significant transactions
    issued 400 million of senior unsecured notes under our existing universal
     shelf registration statement at december 31 2004 our remaining capacity
     under the shelf registration is approximately 25 billion
    retired a total of 487 million of our 35 convertible debentures and zero
     coupon convertible debentures in exchange for 154 million of cash and 38
     million shares of common stock
    repaid 115 million of loans payable the majority of which related to our
     7625 debentures due 2024 as a result of certain bond holders exercising
     their early repayment option

we currently have unrestricted  access to a 2 billion revolving credit facility
with 16 banks at december 31 2004  there were no borrowings  under the credit
facility  the facility  includes one financial  covenant  limiting the ratio of
total debt to total  capital  as defined  to not greater than 60 at december
31 2004 this ratio was 41 our revolving  credit  facility  expires in august
2005 and we are currently  negotiating  with leading  financial  institutions to
arrange a new credit  facility  we believe that a new credit  facility  will be
arranged  and  executed  in the  first  half of 2005 on  competitive  terms  and
conditions corning is seeking up to a 10 billion credit facility with up to a
five  year  term  among  the terms and  conditions  being  negotiated  corning
believes it will be subject to two financial covenants

the  remaining  zero coupon  convertible  debentures  totaling  272 million at
december 31 2004 will likely be put back to us on november 8 2005 at 81954
per  debenture  or on november 8 2010  at 90529 per  debenture  we have the
option of settling this  obligation in cash  common stock  or a combination of
both  from time to time we may retire  additional  debt securities for cash or
equity

additionally  effective  november 8 2004  we have the right to redeem some or
all of the outstanding 35 convertible debentures at any time prior to maturity
at redemption prices ranging from 1020 to 1005 of the principal amount based
on the date we exercise our redemption  options it is possible that during 2005
we may exercise this redemption  option  or execute other privately  negotiated
transactions  to  retire  some  or all of our  297  million  outstanding  35
convertible debentures

capital spending

capital  spending  totaled 857 million  366 million and 357 million in 2004
2003 and 2002  respectively  capital spending  activity in 2004 2003 and 2002
primarily  included  expansion  of lcd  capacity  and new  capacity  for  diesel
substrates  our 2005  capital  spending  program is expected to be in the range
of12 billion to 14 billion of which 900 million to 11 billion will be to
expand   manufacturing   capacity  for  lcd  glass  substrates  in  the  display
technologies  segment   these  expenditures   primarily  relate  to  previously
announced expansion plans for our existing  manufacturing  facilities in tainan
taiwan  and  shizuoka  japan  and for the  construction  of a new  facility  in
taichung  taiwan  additionally  approximately  140  million will be directed
toward our  environmental  technologies  segment in anticipation of the emerging
diesel emissions control market

restructuring

during 2004  2003 and 2002 we made  payments of 85 million  233 million and
278 million  respectively  related to employee severance and other exit costs
resulting from restructuring  actions cash payments for employeerelated  costs
will be  substantially  completed  by the end of 2005  while  payments for exit
activities will be substantially completed by the end of 2007

key balance sheet data

at december 31 2004 cash cash equivalents and shortterm  investments totaled
19 billion compared with 13 billion at december 31 2003 the increase from
december  31  2003  was  primarily  due to the  issuance  of 400  million  of
longterm debt and improved operating cash flows  including the receipt of 204
million in customer deposits

our 2004  earnings  were not  adequate to cover our fixed  charges  principally
interest and related  charges on debt  primarily as a result of the impairment
charges in the  telecommunications  segment and our  decision  to  increase  our
valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets we expect our full year
2005 earnings will be sufficient to cover our fixed charges

management assessment of liquidity

our major source of funding for 2005 and beyond will be our existing  balance of
cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments from time to time we may also
issue debt or equity  securities to raise  additional  cash to fund a portion of
our capital  expenditures  related to our growth  businesses  we are  currently
negotiating  with leading  financial  institutions for a new credit facility and
believe we will arrange and execute one in the first half of 2005 we believe we
have  sufficient  liquidity  for the  next  several  years  to fund  operations
restructuring  the  asbestos  settlement  research  and  development  capital
expenditures and scheduled debt repayments

we have provided other  financial  guarantees and contingent  liabilities in the
form of standby letters of credit and performance  bonds  some of which do not
have fixed or  scheduled  expiration  dates  we have agreed to provide a credit
facility  related to dow corning as  discussed  in note 7  investments  to the
consolidated  financial  statements  the  funding  of the  dow  corning  credit
facility will be required only if dow corning is not otherwise  able to meet its
scheduled funding  obligations in its confirmed  bankruptcy plan we believe the
significant majority of these guarantees and contingent  liabilities will expire
without being funded

pensions

we have a number of defined benefit pension plans covering  certain domestic and
international  employees  our largest  single  pension plan is  cornings  us
qualified  plan  at  december  31  2004  this plan  accounted  for 82 of our
consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and 91
of the related plans assets  in 2004 and 2003  although  global  equities had
positive returns  interest rates continued to decline as a result at december
31 2004 and 2003 the  accumulated  benefit  obligation  abo for our domestic
qualified and nonqualified  plans and several  international plans exceeded the
fair  value of  related  plan  assets  which  required  corning  to  record  an
additional minimum pension liability in accordance with sfas no 87 employers

we have  traditionally  contributed  to the us  qualified  pension  plan on an
annual  basis  in  excess  of the irs  minimum  requirements  and as a  result
mandatory  contributions  are not expected to be required for this plan until at
least 2008 we  contributed  40 million in 2004 to our us  pension plan  for
2005 we anticipate  making voluntary  contributions of at least 100 million in
cash or common stock to this plan

critical accounting policies and estimates

the  preparation  of  financial  statements  requires us to make  estimates  and
assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates that required us
to make difficult subjective or complex judgments follow

impairment of goodwill

sfas 142 requires us to make certain difficult subjective and complex judgments
on a number of matters  including  assumptions  and estimates used to determine
the fair value of our reporting units which are the same as our segments

we measure fair value on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows our
estimates are based upon our historical  experience  our current knowledge from
our commercial  relationships  and available external  information about future
trends

telecommunications

pricing in the  telecommunications  industry  remains  depressed  our  previous
forecasts  assumed  some  rationalization  of  capacity  that would lead to more
stable  pricing  we now expect the  current  depressed  pricing  conditions  to
persist   based  on  competitive  conditions  and  forecasted  future  customer
requirements we do not expect the level of demand for premium fiber products we
previously  forecasted  as a result we have significantly  reduced our outlook
for future  revenue and  profitability  from  premium  products  as we forecast
customer demand  we have lowered the rate of volume growth in the longer range
further negative developments in the telecommunications  industry could cause us
to change our forecasts for fiber  volumes  pricing or mix of premium  products
which  may  result  in  additional  goodwill  impairment  charges  of up to 123
million

terminal value of the business  assumes a growth in perpetuity of 3 these cash
flows are also used to value  intangible and tangible assets which determine the
implied  value of reporting  unit  goodwill  the discount rate applied to these
cash flows  represents  a  telecommunications  weighted  average cost of capital
based upon current debt and equity activity of 11 public companies  representing
a cross section of worldwide  competitors  of the reporting  unit  for our 2004
impairment  test  we used a discount rate of 125 in our  calculation  of fair
value of the expected future cash flows an impairment  charge of 1420 million
was recorded in 2004 had we used a discount rate of 12 the impairment  charge
would have been  approximately 90 million lower had we used a discount rate of
13 the impairment charge would have been  approximately 80 million higher in
2003 we used a 12 discount rate for our annual impairment test the results of
our 2003 test indicated  that goodwill was not impaired  the 2003 results would
not have changed had we used a discount rate of 115 or 125

specialty materials

our  discounted  cash  flow  test for this  reporting  unit  assumes a growth in
perpetuity  of 3  the  discount  rate  applied  to the  forecasted  cash flows
represents  weighed  average cost of capital  based upon current debt and equity
activity of eight public  companies  representing  a cross  section of worldwide
competitors  of the reporting  unit for the 2004 and 2003  impairment  tests we
used a discount rate of 12 in our calculation of the fair value of the expected
future  cash  flows  the  results  of our 2004 and 2003  tests  indicated  that
goodwill  was not  impaired  the results  would not have  changed had we used a
discount rate of 115 or 125

impairment of assets held for use

sfas no 144  accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets
requires us to assess the  recoverability  of the carrying  value of  longlived
assets when an event of impairment  has occurred  we must exercise  judgment in
assessing  whether  an  event  of  impairment  has  occurred  for  purposes  of
recognition and measurement of an impairment  loss a longlived asset or assets
is grouped  with  other  assets and  liabilities  at the lowest  level for which
identifiable  cash  flows are  largely  independent  of the cash  flows of other
assets and liabilities  we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level
for which  identifiable cash flows are largely  independent of the cash flows of
other assets and liabilities

in 2004  based on our decision to permanently  abandon certain assets and lower
our  outlook  for the  telecommunications  segment  we  determined  an event of
impairment  had  occurred in our  telecommunications  segment  we  performed an
impairment test on the segments  longlived  assets and recorded a 24 million
charge to writedown certain assets to their fair value

in 2003  we concluded  events of impairment  had occurred in our  semiconductor
materials product line which is part of the specialty  materials  segment  and
performed  an  impairment  test  the  results  of our test  indicated  that our
longlived assets held for use were not impaired

restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions

during 2004 and 2003 we recorded  writedowns of property  plant and equipment
as a result of decisions to exit facilities primarily in the telecommunications
segment assets impaired were primarily equipment  construction in progress and
buildings  which were sold or abandoned  we used  information  available  from
recent auctions of  telecommunications  equipment to estimate salvage value when
measuring impairment  the estimated salvage values were very low primarily due
to the depressed market for  telecommunications  related equipment  the salvage
values of  property  impaired  were also  estimated  to be  minimal  as  certain
facilities  will be abandoned and not sold  it is possible that actual  results
will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to reserves

valuation allowances for deferred income taxes

sfas 109 requires us to exercise  judgment about our future results in assessing
the realizability of our deferred tax assets at december 31 2004  corning had
gross deferred tax assets of approximately 23 billion  we determined that the
likelihood of  realization  of certain  deferred tax assets is less than 50 and
recorded additional  valuation  allowances of 12 billion in 2004 to reduce our
net deferred tax assets to 532 million  if we sustain an appropriate  level of
profitability  primarily in the us and germany  or if we are able to develop
additional  taxplanning  strategies  or if the  pcc  settlement  is  finalized
earlier than we anticipate adjustments to these allowances will be required and
may affect future net income

in  determining  the amount of domestic  deferred tax assets that we believe are
more likely than not to be realized  through a tax planning  strategy  involving
the sale of a nonstrategic asset we estimated the fair value of the underlying
nonstrategic  asset based  primarily  on  discounted  cash flows and  precedent
transactions  changes in fair value of the nonstrategic  asset may also affect
future net income

probability of litigation outcomes

sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies  requires us to make judgments about
future events that are inherently uncertain  in making determinations of likely
outcomes of litigation  matters  we consider the evaluation of outside  counsel
knowledgeable  about each  matter  as well as known  outcomes in case law  see
legal  proceedings  for a detailed  discussion of the key litigation  matters we
face  the  most  significant  matter  involving  judgment  is the pcc  asbestos
liability  there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential  liability
including the inherent complexity of a chapter 11 filing our history of success
in defending  ourselves against asbestos claims  our assessment of the strength
of our  corporate  veil  defenses  our  continuing  dialogue with our insurance
carriers and the claimants representatives  and other factors we have reached
a tentative  settlement  on pcc as  disclosed  in legal  proceedings  and note 7
investments  to the  consolidated  financial  statements  the  settlement  is
subject to a number of contingencies including approval by the bankruptcy court
and resolution of any appeals

pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb

pension and opeb costs and  obligations  are  dependent on  assumptions  used in
calculating such amounts  these assumptions include discount rates health care
cost trend  rates  benefits  earned  interest  cost  expected  return on plan
assets  mortality  rates  and other factors  in accordance with gaap  actual
results that differ from the  assumptions  are  accumulated  and amortized  over
future  periods and  therefore  generally  affect  recognized  expense and the
recorded  obligation  in future  periods  while  management  believes  that the
assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in
assumptions may affect cornings  pension and other  postretirement  obligations
and future expense



the following  information  illustrates  the  sensitivity to a change in certain
assumptions  for us  pension  plans as of  december  31  2004 the  projected
benefit  obligation  pbo for us  pension  plans was 2056  million  and the
minimum pension  liability  charges to equity with respect to us pension plans
was 279 million net of tax

                                                                                              effect on

25 basis point increase in discount rate                        4 million                 55 million
25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets            4 million
25 basis point increase in expected return on assets            4 million



the above sensitivities  reflect impact of changing one assumption at a time it
should be noted that  economic  factors and  conditions  often  affect  multiple
assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not
necessarily linear

these  changes  in  assumptions  would  have  no  effect  on  cornings  funding
requirements  in addition  at december 31 2004 a 25 basis point  decrease in
the discount rate would decrease stockholders equity by 55 million before tax
a 25 basis point  increase in the  discount  rate would  increase  stockholders
equity by 53  million  with a 25 basis point  decrease in the  discount  rate
certain  pension  plans  would  become  accumulated   benefit  obligation  abo
underfunded  resulting in a significantly  larger impact on equity compared to a
25 basis point increase in the discount rate in addition the impact of greater
than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the
first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate
assumption related to cornings us opeb plans

environment

we have been named by the  environmental  protection  agency under the superfund
act  or by  state  governments  under  similar  state  laws  as a  potentially
responsible party for 11 active hazardous waste sites  under the superfund act
all  parties  who may have  contributed  any waste to a  hazardous  waste  site
identified  by such  agency  are jointly and  severally  liable for the cost of
cleanup unless the agency agrees  otherwise  it is our policy to accrue for the
estimated   liability  related  to  superfund  sites  and  other   environmental
liabilities  related  to  property  owned  and  operated  by us based on  expert
analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants  we
have  accrued   approximately  14  million  for  the  estimated  liability  for
environmental  cleanup and related  litigation at december 31 2004  based upon
the  information  developed  to date  we believe  that the accrued  amount is a
reasonable  estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in
an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote

new accounting standards

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151  inventory costs  an amendment
of arb no 43  chapter 4 sfas 151  sfas 151 amends arb no 43 chapter 4
inventory  pricing to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense
freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as
currentperiod charges additionally sfas 151 requires that allocation of fixed
production  overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity
of the  production  facilities  corning is required to adopt sfas 151 effective
january 1 2006  corning  does not  expect the  adoption  of sfas 151 to have a
material  impact  on  its  consolidated  results  of  operations  and  financial
condition

in december  2004  the fasb issued sfas no 123  revised  2004  sharebased
payment sfas 123r which replaces sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased
compensation  sfas 123 and supercedes apb opinion no 25  accounting for
stock  issued to  employees  sfas 123r  requires all  sharebased  payments to
employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the
financial  statements at fair value beginning in cornings third quarter  under
sfas 123r  corning must determine the  appropriate  fair value model to be used
for valuing sharebased payments the amortization method for compensation cost
and the transition  method to be used at date of adoption  the standard permits
three transition method adoption alternatives

    prospective adoption would require corning to begin expensing sharebased
     payments after july 1 2005  prior interim and annual periods would not be
     restated
    modified  prospective  adoption  would require corning to begin expensing
     sharebased  payments effective january 1 2005 prior annual periods would
     not be restated
    modified  retrospective adoption would require corning to begin expensing
     sharebased  payments effective january 1 2005 prior annual periods would
     be restated

we are  currently  evaluating  the  impact  that  sfas  123r  will  have  on its
consolidated results of operations and financial  condition  which in part will
be dependent on the  transition and  amortization  methods used to adopt the new
rules in 2005  our current  estimate is that our 2005 pretax expense will be in
the range of 25 million to 50  million  and that future  years  expense  will
approximate 60 million

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 exchanges of nonmonetary assets
 an amendment of apb opinion no 29  accounting for nonmonetary  transactions
sfas 153  sfas 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for
nonmonetary  exchanges of similar  productive  assets in paragraph  21b of apb
opinion no 29 accounting for nonmonetary  transactions and replaces it with
an exception  for  exchanges  that do not have  commercial  substance  sfas 153
specifies  that a nonmonetary  exchange has  commercial  substance if the future
cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the
exchange  corning  is  required  to adopt sfas 153  effective  january 1 2006
corning does not expect the adoption of sfas 153 will have a material  impact on
its consolidated results of operations and financial condition

item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks


we operate and conduct  business in many foreign  countries  and as a result are
exposed to  movements  in foreign  currency  exchange  rates  our  exposure  to
exchange rate effects includes

    exchange  rate  movements  on  financial   instruments   and   transactions
     denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings and
    exchange  rate  movements   upon   conversion  of  net  assets  in  foreign
     subsidiaries  for which the  functional  currency  is not the us  dollar
     which impact our net equity

our most significant  foreign currency exposures relate to japan  korea taiwan
and western  european  countries  we  selectively  enter into foreign  exchange
forward and option contracts with durations generally 15 months or less to hedge
our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and  purchases  the
hedges are  scheduled  to mature  coincident  with the timing of the  underlying
foreign currency commitments and transactions  the objective of these contracts
is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results
we also enter into foreign  exchange  forward  contracts when  situations  arise
where our  foreign  subsidiaries  or  corning  enter  into  lending  situations
generally on an intercompany  basis  denominated in currencies other than their
local currency  we do not hold or issue  derivative  financial  instruments for
trading purposes

equity in  earnings of  associated  companies  has  historically  contributed  a
significant amount of our income from continuing operations  equity in earnings
of associated  companies  net of impairments  was 443 million in 2004 and 209
million  in 2003  with  foreignbased  affiliates  comprising  over  70 of this
amount  equity  earnings  from samsung  corning and samsung  corning  precision
totaled  309  million  for  2004  and  105  million  in  2003  exchange  rate
fluctuations  and actions taken by  management of these  entities to reduce this
risk can affect the earnings of these companies

we use a  sensitivity  analysis  to assess the market risk  associated  with our
foreign currency  exchange risk  market risk is defined as the potential change
in fair value of assets and  liabilities  resulting from an adverse  movement in
foreign  currency  exchange  rates  at december 31  2004  we had open forward
contracts  open option contracts  foreign denominated debt with values exposed
to exchange rate  movements  all of which were designated as hedges at december
31 2004 a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could
result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 122 million specific to
the  japanese  yen a 10 adverse  movement in quoted yen  exchange  rates could
result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 45 million

the  nature  of our  foreign  exchange  rate  risk  exposures  has  not  changed
materially from december 31 2003

as we derive more than 60 of our net sales from outside the us our sales and
net income could be affected if the us  dollar  significantly  strengthens  or
weakens against foreign currencies  most notably the japanese yen and euro our
outlooks included in managements  discussion and analysis assume no significant
changes  in  currency  exchange  rates  during  2005  a plus or  minus 10 point
movement  in the us  dollar  japanese  yen  exchange  rate would  result in a
change  to  net  sales  of   approximately   180  million  and  net  income  of
approximately 150 million a plus or minus 10 point movement in the us dollar
 euro exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately  50
million but would have a negligible effect on net income

interest rate risk management

in march and april of 2002  we entered into three  interest rate swaps that are
fair value hedges and  economically  exchanged a notional amount of 275 million
of fixed rate longterm debt to floating rate debt  under the terms of the swap
agreements  we paid the  counterparty  a  floating  rate that is indexed to the
sixmonth  libor rate and received the fixed rates of 83 to 8875  which are
the stated  interest  rates on the longterm  debt  instruments  as a result of
these transactions corning was exposed to the impact of interest rate changes

in 2004 and 2003 we  terminated  the interest  rate swap  agreements  described
above  the  termination  of these swaps resulted in gains of 5 million in 2004
and 15 million in 2003 which we will  amortize  to  earnings as a reduction  of
interest expense over the remaining life of the debt the cash proceeds from the
termination  of the swaps totaled 8 million in 2004 and 17 million in 2003 and
are included in the  financing  section of our  consolidated  statements of cash
flows

it is our policy to  conservatively  manage our  exposure to changes in interest
rates  our policy  sets a maximum  cap that total  variable  rate debt will not
exceed 35 of the total debt  portfolio at anytime  at december  31 2004  our
consolidated debt portfolio contained less than 1 of variable rate instruments

disclosure controls and procedures

our principal executive and principal  financial officers  after evaluating the
effectiveness  of our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  as defined in the
securities  exchange act of 1934 rules  13a15e or 15d15e as of the end of

internal control over financial reporting

a  managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting
     

     management  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining   adequate
     internal  control  over  financial   reporting  for  corning  and  for  our
     assessment  of  the   effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial
     reporting cornings internal control over financial reporting is a process
     designed to provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of
     financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for
     external  purposes  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally
     accepted in the united states of america  cornings  internal control over
     financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain
     to the  maintenance of records that in reasonable  detail  accurately and
     fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of cornings assets  ii
     provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
     permit  preparation of financial  statements in accordance  with accounting
     principles  generally  accepted in the united  states of america  and that
     cornings  receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
     authorizations  of cornings  management and  directors  and iii provide
     reasonable   assurance   regarding   prevention  or  timely   detection  of
     unauthorized  acquisition  use or  disposition  of cornings  assets that
     could have a material effect on the financial statements

     because  of its  inherent  limitations  internal  control  over  financial
     reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any
     evaluation of  effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
     controls may become  inadequate  because of changes in conditions  or that
     the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate

     management  conducted an evaluation of the  effectiveness  of the system of
     internal  control  over  financial  reporting  based  on the  framework  in
     internal  control    integrated  framework  issued  by  the  committee  of
     sponsoring  organizations  of  the  treadway  commission   based  on  this
     evaluation  management  concluded  that  cornings  internal  control over
     financial  reporting  was  effective as of december 31 2004  managements
     assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  cornings   internal  control  over
     financial  reporting  has been  audited by  pricewaterhousecoopers  llp an

     identified in connection  with the evaluation  required by paragraph d of
     exchange  act rules 13a15 or 15d15 that  occurred  during our last fiscal
     quarter  that  have  materially  affected  or  are  reasonably  likely  to

our  independent  auditor  pricewaterhousecoopers  llp  pwc  has  recently
notified the audit  committee of our board of directors the audit  committee
that certain nonaudit work it performed in china potentially violated the secs
independence rules on scope of service

pwc performs expatriate tax return preparation services for certain employees of
corning in china in conjunction  with these services  pwcs affiliated firm in
china took custody of funds intended to satisfy the  employees tax  obligations
and remitted payment of those funds to the local taxing authorities on behalf of
the employees  as a result  pwc had custody of funds that may have belonged to
corning  which is not  permitted  under sec  auditor  independence  rules  the
payment  aspect of the tax  return  preparation  services  was  discontinued  in
october  2004  the fees paid to pwc for  expatriate  tax services in china were
28550 in 2004  47957 in 2003 and  40278 in 2002  of which the  estimated
amounts  attributable  to the tax payment aspect of services was no more than 5
in any one year the amount of disbursements made by pwcchina was 1168000 in
2004 765000 in 2003 and 559000 in 2002

based upon pwcs disclosure corning evaluated pwcs nonaudit services provided
to corning  during the relevant time periods and did not identify any additional
nonaudit  services that may compromise pwcs  independence for purposes herein
corning  and pwc  continue  to  evaluate  and review  processes  relevant to the
maintenance of pwcs independence

pwc has concluded that its objectivity and impartiality were unaffected by these
services and therefore its independence  has not been impaired  this conclusion
is based upon the nature of services  the de minimus fees associated therewith
the fact that none of its  personnel  who were  involved in providing  these tax
services  performed any audit or  auditrelated  services for corning  and that
those professionals who did conduct the audit were unaware of the payment aspect
of the tax services  in january  2005  pwc issued its  independence  standards
board standard no 1 independence  letter to the audit committee of our board of
directors and therein reported that it is independent under applicable standards
in connection with its audit opinion for the financial  statements  contained in
this report  the audit committee has discussed with pwc its  independence  from
corning and  concurred  with pwc that its  independence  was not impaired by the
provision of these services

competition

corning competes across all of its product lines with many large and varied
manufacturers both domestic and foreign some of these competitors are larger
than corning and some have broader product lines

telecommunications segment

competition within the telecommunications industry is intense among several
significant companies corning is a leading competitor in the segments
principal product lines price and new product innovations are significant
competitive factors the continued downturn in the telecommunications industry
particularly in europe and north america has changed the competitive landscape
by increasing competition based upon pricing these competitive conditions are
likely to persist

corning is the largest producer of optical fiber and cable products but faces
significant competition due to continued excess capacity in the market place
price pressure and new product innovations corning obtained the first
significant optical fiber patents and believes its large scale manufacturing
experience fiber process technology leadership and intellectual property
assets yield cost advantages relative to several of its competitors the primary
competing producers of optical fiber products are furukawa ofs fujikura
sumitomo alcatel pirelli and draka furukawa including ofs is cornings
largest competitor for optical fiber cable products cornings primary
competitors are furukawa ofs pirelli alcatel alcoa fujikura and sumitomo

for hardware and equipment products significant competitors are 3m company
3m tyco electronics ofs commscope connectivity systems adc
communications and marconi

technologies segment

cornings principal products face competition from a variety of materials
manufacturers some of which manufacture similar products made from materials
other than glass and ceramics among other things innovation product quality
performance and service are key competitive elements

corning is the largest worldwide producer of advanced liquid crystal display
glass substrate products and that market position remained relatively stable
over the past year corning believes it has competitive advantages in liquid
crystal display glass substrate products by investing in new technologies
offering a consistent source of reliable supply using its proprietary fusion
manufacturing process at facilities in kentucky japan and taiwan and delivering
thinner lighter weight and larger size products asahi glass nippon electric
glass and nh techno are cornings principal competitors in display glass
substrates products in addition new entrants are seeking to expand their
presence in this business

for worldwide automotive ceramic substrate products corning has a leading
market position that has remained relatively stable over the past year corning
believes its competitive advantage in automotive ceramic substrate products for
catalytic converters is based upon global presence customer service
engineering design services and product innovation corning has a leading market
position in ceramic substrates for heavy duty diesel applications the light
duty diesel vehicle market opportunity is still emerging cornings
environmental technologies products face principal competition from ngk denso
ibiden and emitec


page



corning is a leading supplier of glass and plastic science laboratory products
with a growing plastics products market presence in north america and europe
and a relatively stable laboratory glass products market presence during 2003
corning seeks to maintain competitive advantages relative to its competitors by
emphasizing product quality product availability supply chain efficiency a
wide product line and superior product attributes for laboratory products
schott glaswerke kimble greiner and becton dickinson are the principal
worldwide competitors

cav was a producer of conventional television glass products in north america
in 2003 its market position declined due to competition from asian television
glass suppliers and as the market shifted from conventional cathode ray tubes to
flat panel cathode ray tubes and other technologies cav ceased production in
june 2003 samsung corning is the third largest worldwide producer of cathode
ray tube glass products for conventional televisions its relative competitive
position has remained stable over the past year samsung corning seeks to
maintain their competitive advantage through customer support logistics
expertise and a lower cost manufacturing structure nippon electric glass
asahi and various other asian manufacturers compete with samsung corning

corning is a leading supplier of materials and products for lithography optics
in the semiconductor industry and that market position remained relatively
stable during the past year corning seeks to compete by providing superior
optical quality leading optical designs and a local corning presence supporting
its customers for cornings semiconductor optical material products general
specialty glassglass ceramic products and ophthalmic products schott
glaswerke shinetsu quartz products hoya and hereaus are the main competitors

corning strives to maintain its position through technology and product
innovation for the future corning believes its competitive advantage lies in
its commitment to research and development its financial resources and its
commitment to quality there is no assurance that corning will be able to
maintain its market position or competitive advantage

raw materials

cornings production of specialty glasses and related materials requires
significant quantities of energy and batch materials

although energy shortages have not been a problem recently corning has achieved
flexibility through important engineering changes to take advantage of the
lowestcost energy source in most significant processes specifically many of
cornings principal manufacturing processes can now be operated with natural
gas propane oil or electricity or a combination of these energy sources

as to resources ores minerals and processed chemicals required in
manufacturing operations availability appears to be adequate cornings
suppliers from time to time may experience capacity limitations in their own
operations or may eliminate certain product lines nevertheless corning
believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch chemicals
and raw materials for many products corning has alternative glass compositions
that would allow operations to continue without interruption in the event of
specific materials shortages

certain key optical components used in the manufacturing of products within
cornings telecommunications segment are currently sole sourced or available
only from a limited number of sources any future difficulty in obtaining
sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in delays or
reductions in product shipments or reduce cornings gross margins

patents and trademarks

inventions by members of cornings research and engineering staff have been and
continue to be important to the companys growth patents have been granted on
many of these inventions in the united states us and other countries some
of these patents have been licensed to other manufacturers including companies
in which corning has equity investments many of the earlier patents have now
expired but corning continues to seek and obtain patents protecting its newer
innovations in 2003 corning was granted over 300 patents in the us and over
400 patents in countries outside the us

each business segment possesses its own patent portfolio that provides a
competitive advantage in protecting cornings innovations corning has
historically enforced and will continue to enforce its intellectual property
rights at the end of 2003 corning and its subsidiaries owned over 6000
unexpired patents in various countries of which over 3000 were us patents
between 2004 and 2006 approximately 4 of these patents will expire while at
the same time corning intends to seek patents protecting its newer innovations
worldwide corning has over 3000 patent applications in process with over 850
in process in the us as a result corning believes that its patent portfolio
will continue to provide a competitive advantage in protecting cornings
innovation although cornings competitors in each of its businesses are
actively seeking patent protection as well

set to expire between 2004 and 2006

many of these patents are used in cornings operations or are licensed for use
by others and corning is licensed to use patents owned by others corning has
entered into cross licensing arrangements with some major competitors but the
scope of such licenses has been limited to specific product areas or
technologies

most of cornings products are marketed under the following trademarks corning
celcor eagle 2000 eagle apt hpfs leaf pyrex smf28e steuben lanscape and
vycor

protection of the environment

corning has a program to ensure that its facilities are in compliance with
state federal and foreign pollutioncontrol regulations this program resulted
in capital and operating expenditures during the past several years in order to
maintain compliance with such regulations capital expenditures for pollution
control in continuing operations were approximately 7 million in 2003 and are
estimated to be 14 million in 2004

cornings 2003 operating results from continuing operations were charged with
approximately 28 million for depreciation maintenance waste disposal and
other operating expenses associated with pollution control corning believes
that its compliance program will not place it at a competitive disadvantage

risk factors

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and in other
documents we file with the securities and exchange commission sec are some
of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business
results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements or other
projections contained in this annual report on form 10k in addition future
results could be materially affected by general industry and market conditions
changes in laws or accounting rules general us and nonus economic and
political conditions including a global economic slowdown fluctuation of
interest rates or currency exchange rates terrorism political unrest or
international conflicts political instability or major health concerns natural
disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions
these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments
concerning forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k
including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our
business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties our separate
statement labeled forwardlooking statements should be considered in addition to
the statements below

our sales could be negatively impacted if one or more of our key customers
substantially reduce orders for our products

         our customer base is relatively concentrated with less than 10
significant customers accounting for a high percentage greater than 50 of
net sales in most of our businesses including those purchasing liquid crystal
display glass  however no individual customer accounts for more than 10 of
consolidated sales



page



         in our technologies segment several of our businesses also have a
concentrated customer base these businesses include cornings display
technologies environmental products and semiconductor materials if we lose a
significant customer in any of these businesses our sales could be negatively
impacted

         although the sale of display glass has increased from quarter to
quarter in 2003 there can be no assurance that this upward trend will continue
our customers are panel makers and as they switch to larger size glass the
pace of their orders may be uneven while they adjust their manufacturing
processes and facilities there is a risk that our customers may not be able to
access sufficient capital to fund ongoing expansions

         over recent years most of our major customers in the
telecommunications segment have reduced their purchases of our products and have
expressed uncertainty as to their future requirements as a result our sales
have declined to their current low levels and it is difficult to predict future
sales accurately the conditions contributing to this difficulty include

           the prolonged downturn in the telecommunications industry
           uncertainty regarding the capital spending plans of the major
            telecommunications carriers
           potential changes in governmental regulations
           the telecommunications carriers current limited access to the
            capital required for expansion and
           general market and economic uncertainty

         while we have responded to the depressed telecommunications market by
reducing excess capacity and cutting costs we cannot assure you that our plans
will be successful in mitigating the adverse effects of a prolonged downturn
the continuing downturn in the telecommunications industry may be more severe
and prolonged than expected if our net sales continue to decline our ability
to meet financial expectations for future periods may be impaired and we may
need to impair goodwill or record additional reserves against deferred tax
assets

if we do not successfully adjust our manufacturing volumes and fixed cost
structure or achieve manufacturing yields or sufficient product reliability
our operating results could suffer and we may not achieve profitability as
anticipated

         in the economic and industry downturn for our telecommunications
segment we have responded to the softer market by cutting costs including the
reduction of our manufacturing volumes we continued to execute our
restructuring plans in 2003 we have closed two fiber facilities and mothballed
another and closed several factories that made photonics cabling or hardware
and equipment in 2003 we reduced our workforce by 1975 positions and we have
reduced more than 21000 positions since 2001 we cannot assure you that our
plans will be successful in mitigating the adverse effects of a softer market
nor can we assure you that additional adjustments and charges will not be
necessary to respond to further market changes

         we plan to spend 425 million to 475 million in 2004 to expand our
liquid crystal display glass facilities in response to increased customer
demand although we expect to complete these expansion projects we may not
achieve the manufacturing efficiencies product improvements or level of sales
that we anticipate

         in addition our restructuring programs and current business plans are
designed to restore profitability and improve cash flow but we cannot be
certain that this will occur or that we will return to positive cash flow at the
levels and in the time period we are targeting

         the manufacturing of our products involves highly complex and precise
processes requiring production in highly controlled and clean environments any
changes in our manufacturing processes or those of our suppliers could
significantly reduce our manufacturing yields and product reliability in some
cases existing manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the volume or cost
targets of our customers we will need to develop new manufacturing processes
and techniques to achieve targeted volume and cost levels while we continue to
fund projects to improve our manufacturing techniques and processes we may not
achieve cost levels in our manufacturing activities that will fully satisfy our
customers

we have incurred and may in the future incur restructuring and other charges
the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately

         the telecommunications industry was severely hampered from 2001 to 2003
by continued excess manufacturing capacity increased intensity of competition
and growing pressure on price and profits these negative trends are expected to
continue in 2004 in 2001 through 2003 we recorded charges for restructuring
impairment of assets and the writeoff of cost and equity based investments


page



         our ability to forecast our customers needs for our products in the
current economic and industry environment is limited our results in 2003 and
2002 included significant charges for impairment of longlived assets primarily
in the telecommunications segment and the conventional television glass and
specialty materials businesses of our technologies segment

         we may record additional charges for restructuring or other asset
impairments if additional actions become necessary to respond to align costs to
a reduced level of demand

in the event we incur continued operating losses we may be unable to recognize
future deferred tax assets and may be required to reassess our ability to
realize the deferred tax assets already recorded

         at december 31 2003 we had recorded gross deferred tax assets of
approximately 21 billion with a valuation allowance of 469 million and
offset by deferred tax liabilities of 201 million net domestic deferred tax
assets were approximately 13 billion although management expects the domestic
deferred tax assets to be realized from future earnings currently we are
generating domestic losses our forecast of domestic income is based on
assumptions about and current trends in our operating segments and we can not
assure you that such results will be achieved as a result we may record
additional material deferred tax valuation reserves that would reduce our net
income and shareholders equity  if we record such a valuation allowance we
will also cease to recognize additional tax benefits on any losses in the us

if the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate
demand for our products may decline further which would negatively impact our
results of operations and financial performance

         the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing
technologies evolving industry government standards and frequent new product
introductions our success is expected to depend in substantial part on the
timely and successful introduction of new products upgrades of current products
to comply with emerging industry government standards our ability to acquire
technologies needed to remain competitive and our ability to address competing
technologies and products in addition the following factors related to our
products and the markets for them if not achieved could have an adverse impact
on our results of operations and financial performance

           our ability to introduce leading products such as glass for flat
            panel displays optical fiber and environmental substrate products
            that can command competitive prices in the marketplace
           our ability to maintain or achieve a favorable mix of sales
            between premium and nonpremium fiber and new generations and
            larger sizes of display glass products
           our ability to continue to develop new product lines to address
            our customers diverse needs within the several market segments
            that we participate in which requires a high level of innovation
            as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market
            trends
           our ability to develop new products in response to favorable
            government regulations and laws driving customer demand
            particularly environmental substrate diesel filter products and
            telecommunications segment products associated with fiber to the
            premises or
           our ability to create the infrastructure required to support
            anticipated growth in certain businesses

we face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely
affect our results of operations and financial performance

         we periodically face pricing pressures in each of our leading
businesses as a result of intense competition emerging new technologies or
overcapacity while we will work toward reducing our costs to respond to the
pricing pressures that may continue we may not be able to achieve proportionate
reductions in costs as a result of overcapacity and the current economic and
industry downturn in the telecommunications segment pricing pressures continued
in 2003 particularly in our optical fiber and cable products pricing pressure
has also continued in our display glass business as the manufacturers of desktop
displays strive to reduce their costs

we have incurred and may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible
asset impairment charges

         acquisitions recorded as purchases for accounting purposes have
resulted in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and other
purchased intangibles at december 31 2003 the telecommunications and
technologies operating segment goodwill balances were 16 billion and 159
million respectively the potential impairment of these assets could reduce our
net income and shareholders equity

         effective january 1 2002 we adopted financial accounting standards
board statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 goodwill
and other intangible assets pursuant to which goodwill is no longer amortized
but is subject to impairment tests at least annually  the goodwill impairment
accounting rules are intricate and require that we make certain difficult
subjective and complex judgments involving a number of matters including
assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting
units  under sfas no 142 goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting
unit level  the criteria for establishing a reporting unit is dependent upon
how a company determines its operating segments under sfas no 131
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information
specifically sfas no 142 permits a company to define a reporting unit as
either an operating segment a component of an operating segment or an
aggregation of two or more components of an operating segment  the reporting
unit for the telecommunications segment goodwill is the telecommunications
operating segment  the reporting units for the technologies segment are
components of the technologies segment

         during 2002 we completed our annual goodwill impairment test
determined the telecommunications goodwill balance was impaired and recorded a
related impairment charge of 400 million  our 2002 testing results also
determined that the technologies segment goodwill was not impaired  in the
fourth quarter of 2003 we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests and
determined that the goodwill balances were not impaired  while we believe the
estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment
tests are reasonable we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges
will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by
management do not occur

         we are currently in discussion with the staff of the sec on the
determination of our operating segments  we believe that our determination of
our operating segments under sfas no 131 is appropriate  however it is
possible that the outcome of this discussion could be a revision of how we
define and disclose our operating segments  a change in how we define our
telecommunications operating segment could impact our goodwill impairment tests
under sfas no 142  specifically we could be required to record a net
additional goodwill impairment charge of up to 600 million pre tax in 2002
although this potential charge would increase our 2002 net loss it would not
impact our 2002 operating cash flows because goodwill impairments are noncash
charges  our debt to capital ratio ranged from 44 to 47 throughout 2002
this potential charge would have increased our debt to capital ratio to no
higher than 51 which would still be below the 60 financial covenant limit
relating to our 20 billion revolving credit facility  the potential 2002
goodwill impairment charge would have no impact on operating results or
operating cash flows for the year ended december 31 2003

we may be limited in our ability to obtain additional capital on commercially
reasonable terms

         although we believe existing cash shortterm investments and borrowing
capacity collectively provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating
requirements we may be required to seek additional financing to compete
effectively in our markets our public debt ratings affect our ability to raise
capital and the cost of such capital in july 2002 fitch downgraded our senior
unsecured longterm debt rating from bbb to bb standard  poors downgraded
our senior unsecured longterm debt rating from bbb to bb and shortterm debt
credit rating from a3 to b and moodys reduced our senior unsecured longterm
debt rating from baa3 to ba2 and shortterm debt credit rating from prime3 to
not prime these and any further downgrades may increase our borrowing costs and
affect our ability to access the debt capital markets

         as a result of our lower debt ratings we may face difficulties in our
business for example we may face increasing requirements to post cash
collateral for performance bonds and some customers may seek alternative
suppliers

         we are subject under our revolving credit facility to a covenant that
requires us to maintain a ratio of total debt to capital as defined under the
credit facility of not greater than 60 our total debt to capital ratio was
34 at december 31 2003 this covenant may limit our ability to borrow funds
further declines or failure to recover in our telecommunications segment could
cause impairments of goodwill deferred tax assets tangible or intangible
assets or restructuring charges related to our overall business additional
impairments or charges could materially increase our total debt to capital ratio
which may reduce the amounts we are able to borrow under the revolving credit
facility

if our products or components purchased from our suppliers experience
performance issues our business will suffer

         our business depends on the production of excellent products of
consistently high quality to this end our products including components
purchased from our suppliers are tested for quality both by us and our
customers nevertheless our products are highly complex and our customers
testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and
foreseeable failure scenarios for various reasons including among others the
occurrence of performance problems unforeseeable in testing our products and
components purchased from our suppliers may fail to perform as expected
performance issues could result from faulty design or problems in manufacturing
or testing we have experienced such performance issues in the past and remain
exposed to such performance issues in some cases product redesigns or
additional capital equipment may be required to correct a defect in addition
any significant or systemic product failure could result in customer relations
problems and harm the future sales of our products


page


interruptions of supplies from our key suppliers may affect our results of
operations and financial performance

         interruptions of supplies from our key suppliers could disrupt
production or impact our ability to increase production and sales we do not
have longterm or volume purchase agreements with every supplier and may have
limited options for alternative supply if these suppliers fail for any reason
including their business failure or financial difficulties to continue the
supply of components

we face intense competition in most of our businesses

         we expect that we will face additional competition from existing
competitors and from a number of companies that may enter our markets because
some of the markets in which we compete have been historically characterized by
rapid growth and are characterized by rapid technology changes smaller niche
and startup companies may become our principal competitors in the future we
must invest in research and development expand our engineering manufacturing
and marketing capabilities and continue to improve customer service and support
in order to remain competitive while we expect to undertake the investment and
effort in each of these areas we cannot assure you that we will be able to
maintain or improve our competitive position

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and
we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights
of others

         we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property
rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to
permit us to continue or expand our businesses we cannot assure you that the
patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against
our competitors or competitive technologies litigation may be necessary to
enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets and to
determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights litigation is
inherently uncertain and the outcome is often unpredictable other companies
hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking
to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios

         the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to
introduce new products we are and may in the future be subject to claims of
intellectual property infringement or misappropriation and we cannot assure you
as to the outcome of such claims litigation or claims against us could force us
to cease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the intellectual
property that is the subject of such claims obtain a license from a third
party or redesign or rename our products these actions if possible could
result in substantial costs or loss of revenue

current or future litigation may harm our financial condition or results of
operations

         pending threatened or future litigation is subject to inherent
uncertainties our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely
affected by unfavorable outcomes expenses and costs exceeding amounts estimated
or insured in particular we have been named as a defendant in numerous
lawsuits against pcc and several other defendants involving claims alleging
personal injury from exposure to asbestos as described in legal proceedings
our negotiations with the representatives of asbestos claimants have produced a
tentative settlement but certain cases may still be litigated final approval
of a global settlement through the pcc bankruptcy process may impact the results
of operations for the period in which such costs if any are recognized total
charges of 413 million 263 million aftertax have been incurred through
december 31 2003 however the final settlement value will be dependent on the
price of our common stock at the time it is contributed to the settlement trust
management cannot provide assurances that the ultimate outcome of a settlement
will not be materially different from the amount recorded to date

we face risks related to our international operations and sales

         we have customers and significant operations including manufacturing
and sales located outside the us we have large manufacturing operations for
liquid crystal display glass substrates in the asiapacific region including
equity investments in companies operating in china and south korea that make
liquid crystal display glass and telecommunications products and several
significant customers are located in this region as a result of these and other
international operations we face a number of risks including

           major health concerns such as sars
           difficulty of effectively managing our diverse global operations
           change in regulatory requirements
           tariffs duties and other trade barriers
           undeveloped legal systems and
           political and economic instability in foreign markets


page


our equity investments in companies that we do not control generated substantial
equity earnings

         dow corning which makes silicone products and samsung corning
precision which makes liquid crystal display glass are two companies in which
we have a 50 ownership interest during 2003 we recognized 226 million in
equity earnings from these two companies dow corning remains in chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings samsung corning precision is located in the asiapacific
region and as such is subject to those geographic risks referred to above we
have equity investments in other companies within and outside the us and
many of these have been successful operations over the years with 50 or lower
ownership we do not control such equity companies nor their management and
operations performance of our equity investments may not continue at the same
levels in the future

we face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations

         because we have significant customers and operations outside the us
fluctuations in foreign currencies affect our sales and profit levels foreign
exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local
currencies decline in value relative to the dollar

if the financial condition of our customers declines our credit risks could
increase

         in 2002 and 2003 certain of our customers experienced financial
difficulties and some filed with the courts seeking protection under bankruptcy
or reorganization laws we have experienced and in the future may experience
losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable as well
as the loss of such customers ongoing business if our customers fail to meet
their payment obligations to us we could experience reduced cash flows and
losses in excess of amounts reserved as of december 31 2003 reserves for
trade receivables totaled approximately 38 million

we may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us

         we face the risk of loss resulting from and adverse publicity
associated with product liability securities fiduciary liability
intellectual property antitrust contractual warranty fraud and other
lawsuits whether or not such claims are valid in addition our product
liability fiduciary directors and officers property and comprehensive general
liability insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims or may not be
available to the extent we expect our insurance costs have increased
substantially and may increase further we may not be able to get adequate
insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs a successful claim that
exceeds or is not covered by our policy limits could require us to pay
substantial sums some of the carriers in our historic excess insurance program
are not rated or may have lower ratings and may not be able to respond if we
should have claims reaching into excess layers in addition we may not be able
to insure against certain risks or obtain some types of insurance such as
terrorism insurance

in the facilities listed above the largest unused portion is our optical fiber
manufacturing facility in concord north carolina that has been mothballed until
fiber demand rebounds we believe that the concord facility can be returned to
productive capacity within six to nine months of a decision to do so and

item 3  legal proceedings


environmental litigation corning has been named by the environmental protection
agency under the superfund act or by state governments under similar state
laws as a potentially responsible party at 12 active hazardous waste sites
under the superfund act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a
hazardous waste site identified by such agency are jointly and severally
liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is
cornings policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund
sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning
based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external
consultants corning has accrued approximately 21 million for its estimated
liability for environmental cleanup and litigation at december 31 2003 based
upon the information developed to date management believes that the accrued
reserve is a reasonable estimate of the companys estimated liability and that
the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued
is remote

schwinger and stevens toxins lawsuits in april 2002 corning was named as a
defendant in two actions schwinger and stevens filed in the us district
court for the eastern district of new york which asserted various personal
injury and property damage claims against a number of corporate defendants
these claims allegedly arise from the release of toxic substances from a
sylvania nuclear materials processing facility near hicksville new york
amended complaints naming 205 plaintiffs and seeking damages in excess of 3
billion were served in september 2002 the sole basis of liability against
corning was plaintiffs claim that corning was the successor to sylvaniacorning
nuclear corporation a delaware corporation formed in 1957 and dissolved in
1960 management intends to vigorously contest all claims against corning for
the reason that corning is not the successor to sylvaniacorning management
will also defend on the grounds that almost all of the wrongful death claims and
personal injury claims are timebarred at a status conference in december 2002
the court decided to administratively close the schwinger and stevens cases
and ordered plaintiffs counsel to bring new amended complaints with
bellwether plaintiffs in these actions known as schwinger ii and astuto the
plaintiffs have not named corning as a defendant although it appears that
plaintiffs may proceed only against the other corporate defendants the original
schwinger and stevens cases remain pending and no order has been entered
dismissing corning based upon the information developed to date and
recognizing that the outcome of litigation is uncertain management believes
that the likelihood of a materially adverse impact to cornings financial
statements is remote

dow corning bankruptcy corning and dow chemical each own 50 of the common
stock of dow corning which has been in reorganization proceedings under chapter
11 of the us bankruptcy code since may 1995 dow corning filed for bankruptcy
protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousand
breastimplant product lawsuits each of which typically sought damages in excess
of one million dollars on november 8 1998 dow corning and the tort claimants
committee jointly filed a revised plan of reorganization joint plan which
provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims the joint
plan included releases for third parties including corning and dow chemical as
shareholders in exchange for contributions to the joint plan by an order dated
november 30 1999 the bankruptcy court confirmed the joint plan but with
certain limitations concerning the third party releases as reflected in an
opinion issued on december 21 1999 on november 13 2000 the us district
court for the eastern district of michigan reversed the bankruptcy courts
order restored the thirdparty releases and confirmed the joint plan certain
foreign claimants the us government and certain other tort claimants
appealed from the district courts order on january 29 2002 the us court of
appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed the determinations made in the district
court with respect to the foreign claimants but remanded to the district court
for further proceedings with respect to certain lien claims of the us
government and with respect to the findings supporting the nondebtor releases
in favor of dow cornings shareholders foreign subsidiaries and insurers the
plan proponents have settled the lien claims of the us government for 98
million to be paid from the settlement fund under the plan on december 11
2002 the district court entered further findings and conclusions supporting the
nondebtor releases certain tort claimants filed appeals to the us court of
appeals for the sixth circuit from the district courts order one group of
foreign claimants has settled and dismissed their appeal leaving a grouping of
approximately 50 plaintiffs from nevada as the remaining appellants the
appellate process may take another 6 months if the joint plan with shareholder
releases is upheld after all appeals any remaining personal injury claims
against corning in these matters will be channeled to the resolution procedures
under the joint plan if the joint plan with shareholder releases is not upheld
after all appeals corning would expect to defend any remaining claims against
it and any new claims on the same grounds that led to a series of orders and
judgments dismissing all claims against us in the federal courts and in many
state courts as described under the heading implant tort lawsuits immediately
hereafter management believes that the claims against corning lack merit and
that the risk of material impact on cornings financial statements is remote

under the terms of the joint plan dow corning will establish a settlement trust
and a litigation facility to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or
litigate their claims dow corning would have the obligation to fund the trust
and the facility over a period of up to 16 years in an amount up to
approximately 33 billion subject to the limitations terms and conditions
stated in the joint plan corning and dow chemical have each agreed to provide a
credit facility to dow corning of up to 150 million 300 million in the
aggregate subject to the terms and conditions stated in the joint plan the
joint plan also provides for dow corning to make full payment through cash and
issuance of senior notes to its commercial creditors these creditors claim
approximately 810 million in principal plus an additional sum for pendency
interest costs and fees from the petition date may 15 1995 through the
effective date under the plan when payment is made the commercial creditors
have contested the bankruptcy courts disallowance of their claims for
postpetition interest at default rates of interest and have appealed to the
district court the district court heard oral arguments on this appeal on may 2
2002 and has not ruled the amount of additional interest costs and fees at
issue in these claims against dow corning is approximately 100 million pre tax

in 1995 corning fully impaired its investment in dow corning upon its entry
into bankruptcy proceedings and did not recognize equity earnings from the
second quarter of 1995 through the end of 2002 corning began recognizing equity
earnings in the first quarter of 2003 when management concluded that its
emergence from bankruptcy protection was probable based upon the bankruptcy
courts findings on december 11 2002 with the exception of the remote
possibility of a future bankruptcy related charge corning considers the
difference between the carrying value of its investment in dow corning and its
50 share of dow cornings equity to be permanent this difference is 270
million

corning received no dividends from dow corning in 2003 and does not expect to
receive any in 2004

70 pending cases including some cases with multiple claimants in addition to
the transferred louisiana cases the michigan federal court heard cornings

pittsburgh corning corporation corning and ppg industries inc ppg each
own 50 of the capital stock of pcc over a period of more than two decades
pcc and several other defendants have been named in numerous lawsuits involving
claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos on april 16 2000
pcc filed for chapter 11 reorganization in the us bankruptcy court for the
western district of pennsylvania as of the bankruptcy filing pcc had in excess
of 140000 open claims and had insufficient remaining insurance and assets to
deal with its alleged current and future liabilities more than 100000
additional claims have been filed with pcc after its bankruptcy filing at the
time pcc filed for bankruptcy protection there were approximately 12400 claims
pending against corning in state court lawsuits alleging various theories of
liability based on exposure to pccs asbestos products and typically requesting
monetary damages in excess of one million dollars per claim corning has
defended those claims on the basis of the separate corporate status of pcc and
the absence of any facts supporting claims of direct liability arising from
pccs asbestos products corning is also currently named in approximately 11200
other cases approximately 40700 claims alleging injuries from asbestos and
similar amounts of monetary damages per claim those cases have been covered by
insurance without material impact to corning to date asbestos litigation is
inherently difficult and past trends in resolving these claims may not be
indicators of future outcomes

in the bankruptcy court pcc in april 2000 obtained a preliminary injunction
against the prosecution of asbestos actions arising from pccs products against
its two shareholders to afford the parties a period of time the injunction
period in which to negotiate a plan of reorganization for pcc pcc plan the
injunction period was extended on several occasions through september 30 2002
and later for a period from december 23 2002 through january 23 2003 and was
reinstated as of april 22 2003 and will now continue pending developments
with respect to the pcc plan as described below

on may 14 2002 ppg announced that it had agreed with certain of its insurance
carriers and representatives of current and future asbestos claimants on the
terms of a settlement arrangement applicable to claims arising from pccs
products the announced arrangement would permit ppg and certain of its insurers
to make contributions of cash over a period of years ppgs shares in pcc and
pittsburgh corning europe nv pce a belgian corporation and an agreed
number of shares of ppgs common stock in return for a release and injunction
channeling claims against ppg into a settlement trust under the pcc plan

on march 28 2003 corning announced that it had also reached agreement with
representatives of current and future asbestos claimants on a settlement
arrangement that will be incorporated into the pcc plan this settlement is
subject to a number of contingencies including a favorable vote by 75 of the
asbestos claimants voting on the pcc plan and approval by the bankruptcy court
cornings settlement will require the contribution when the plan becomes
effective of its equity interest in pcc its onehalf equity interest in pce
and 25 million shares of corning common stock corning also will be making cash
payments of 136 million net present value as of december 31 2003 in six
installments beginning in june 2005 assuming the plan is effective in addition
corning will assign policy rights or proceeds under primary insurance from 1962
through 1984 as well as rights to sell proceeds under certain excess insurance
most of which falls within the period from 1962 through 1973 in return for
these contributions corning expects to receive a release and an injunction
channeling asbestos claims against it into a settlement trust under the pcc
plan

corning recorded an initial charge of 298 million 192 million aftertax in
the period ending march 31 2003 to reflect the settlement terms however the
amount of the charge for this settlement requires adjustment each quarter based
upon movement in cornings common stock price prior to contribution of the
shares to the trust corning recorded total charges of 413 million 263
million aftertax to reflect the settlement and to marktomarket the value of
corning common stock for the year ended december 31 2003

two of cornings primary insurers and several excess insurers have commenced
litigation for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under
insurance policies including rights that may be affected by the settlement
arrangement described above corning is vigorously contesting these cases
management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation

the pcc plan a disclosure statement and various supplement plan documents were
filed with the court in the second quarter of 2003 additional supplemental plan
documents were filed in midaugust 2003 in october 2003 the court held a
hearing to review the disclosure documents the court has announced a schedule
projecting that the plan and disclosure documents will be mailed to creditors
for voting expected to be completed in march 2004 to be followed by
confirmation hearings in may 2004 although the confirmation of the pcc plan is
subject to a number of contingencies apart from the quarterly adjustment in
the value of 25 million shares of corning common stock management believes that
the likelihood of a material adverse impact to cornings financial statements is
remote

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results

of operations


overview

corning had three significant priorities in 2003 to protect our financial
health to restore profitability and to invest in our future we have made
significant progress towards all three in 2003

financial health

we have improved our balance sheet in 2003 by substantially decreasing our debt
from 42 billion at the beginning of the year to 28 billion we reduced debt
by using cash on hand and by completing equity offerings of 45 million shares of
our common stock for proceeds of 363 million in the third quarter and 50
million shares of our common stock for proceeds of 267 million in the second
quarter these actions improved our debt to capital ratio from 47 at the end of
2002 to 34 at the end of 2003

we have 13 billion in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments
access to a 2 billion revolving credit facility and access to the capital
markets our major source of funding for 2004 and beyond will be our existing
balance of cash and shortterm investments from time to time we may also issue
debt or equity securities to raise additional cash to fund a portion of our
capital expenditures related to our growth businesses we believe we have
sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations
restructuring liabilities the asbestos settlement research and development
expenditures capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments

profitability

on an overall basis we believe that our 2003 results reflect positive
developments including significant growth in our display technologies business
stabilization in our telecommunications segment and exiting our photonics and
conventional video components product lines we incurred a net loss of 223
million or 018 per share in 2003 compared to a net loss of 13 billion or
139 per share in 2002 and a net loss of 55 billion or 589 per share in
2001 the improvements were driven primarily by a reduction in restructuring
impairment and other charges and credits to 111 million 26 million aftertax
and minority interest in 2003 compared to 21 billion 15 billion aftertax
in 2002 and 57 billion 53 billion aftertax in 2001

our 223 million net loss in 2003 included the following

  a charge of 413 million 263 million aftertax related to the pending
   asbestos settlement of current and future tort claims in connection with a
   proposed reorganization plan for our pcc equity affiliate
  a net gain on repurchases of debt of 19 million 12 million aftertax and
  an aftertax charge in equity earnings of 66 million related to an asset
   impairment charge recorded by samsung corning a 50 owned equity venture
   which manufactures glass funnels and panels for conventional television

sales in the telecommunications segment have stabilized remaining relatively
flat from the third quarter of 2002 to the fourth quarter 2003 we have been
able to reduce the loss in the telecommunications segment in 2003 by closing
plants and reducing costs demand for many of our products particularly in
photonics remained soft in july 2003 we completed the sale of certain
photonics assets to avanex and in december 2003 our final shipment of pump
lasers for sale to avanex was completed

sales and earnings in our technologies segment improved primarily due to the
results of our display technologies business sales of this business grew from
93 million in the first quarter of 2002 to 199 million in the fourth quarter
of 2003 offsetting the improvement in the display technologies business the
market for conventional televisions declined as a result we agreed with our
partner to shutdown cav a 51 consolidated venture that manufactured
conventional video components products in addition demand for high purity
fused silica and calcium fluoride products was lower than we had anticipated
therefore we decided to consolidate the operations of our semiconductor
materials products in the fourth quarter of 2003 to make our infrastructure more
flexible for the cyclical nature of this market

investing in our future

we remain committed to investing in innovation and we are investing in a wide
variety of technologies including liquid crystal displays diesel filters and
substrates and the optical fiber cable and hardware and equipment that will
enable fibertothepremises although our spending in research development and
engineering has declined as a percentage of sales it remains above historic
levels


page



we have also continued to invest in capital spending in the technologies
segment capital spending in 2003 and 2002 approximated 370 million and 360
million respectively the majority of which was to expand capacity for liquid
crystal display glass and for new capacity for diesel substrates and filters as
a result of market expansion in 2004 we expect our consolidated capital
spending to approximate 600 million to 650 million of which 425 million to
475 million will be to expand capacity for liquid crystal display glass
production

net sales

consolidated net sales for 2003 were 31 billion a decrease of 2 or 74
million compared to 2002 approximately 158 million of the sales decline
occurred in the photonic technologies and the conventional television glass
products that we exited during 2003 based on the exchange rates at the
beginning of 2003 our sales were favorably impacted by the weakening us
dollar against the yen and the euro by approximately 85 million consolidated
net sales for 2002 were 32 billion a decrease of 48 or 29 billion from
2001 sales of 60 billion the sales decline was most pronounced in the
telecommunications segment where significantly lower demand and price declines
for our optical fiber and cable and photonic technologies products caused sales
to decrease in this segment by 63 or 28 billion year to year sales in the
technologies segment for 2002 decreased 4 or 55 million compared to 2001


page



gross margin

as a percentage of net sales gross margin improved eight points in 2003
compared to 2002 the improvement was driven by lower depreciation and other
fixed costs resulting from the 2002 restructuring actions primarily in the
telecommunications segment gross margin improved in both segments however the
gains achieved in the technologies segment were partially offset by a 13
million writedown of inventory related to the exit of cav as a percentage of
net sales gross margin decreased from 30 to 19 in 2002 compared to 2001
gross margin was impacted by lower sales volumes in the telecommunications
segment which were insufficient to cover fixed manufacturing costs downward
pricing pressure also negatively impacted gross margins primarily in the
optical fiber and cable products these negative trends were offset by
significant fixed cost reductions as manufacturing capacity was shutdown gross
margin in the technologies segment decreased approximately two points from 2001

selling general and administrative expenses

selling general and administrative sga expenses decreased 16 or 117
million in 2003 compared to 2002 and as a percentage of sales improved four
points in the same period the improvement reflects cost savings primarily from
the 2002 and 2003 restructuring actions sga expenses decreased 34 to 716
million in 2002 while sga increased five points as a percentage of net sales to
23 over 2001 the decrease in sga for 2002 reflects cost savings from the
restructuring actions which began in 2001 while the increase as a percentage of
net sales was caused by the more significant decline in revenues

research development and engineering expenses

research development and engineering rde expenses decreased 29 or 139
million in 2003 compared to 2002 and as a percentage of sales improved four
points in the same period the improvement reflects the cost savings which
resulted from the 2002 restructuring actions rde expenses declined 22 or
139 million in 2002 compared to 2001 as a percentage of net sales rde
increased five points from 2001 the decrease in expense for 2002 reflects the
impact of the restructuring actions while the increase as a percentage of net
sales was caused by the more significant decline in revenues

restructuring impairment and other charges and credits

corning recorded significant net charges in 2003 2002 and 2001 these charges
are summarized in the following table in millions

     impairment of goodwill

     2003 annual assessment

     due to market conditions in the telecommunications and semiconductor
     industries we performed goodwill impairment tests for our
     telecommunications and specialty materials reporting units in the fourth
     quarter of 2003 the results of our impairment tests indicated that the
     fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its book value although an
     impairment charge was not required in 2003 it is possible that future
     impairment charges may be required if our expected future cash flow
     estimates are not realized management must exercise judgment in assessing
     the recoverability of goodwill see critical accounting estimates for
     related discussion

     we believe the telecommunication industry is currently depressed but will
     ultimately recover we do not expect growth in this segment in the
     shortterm but believe that growth will return to this segment by 2005
     our view that the industry will recover is based on the fact that bandwidth
     demand continues to grow and the belief that a combination of public
     policy changes consolidation and recovery of industry players and the
     advancement of profitable broadband business models will drive recovery in
     the future

     we believe the specialty materials reporting unit decrease in sales in 2003
     was primarily due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market we
     expect increased volume growth beginning in 2004

     2002 charge

     in the fourth quarter of 2002 we conducted our annual impairment tests and
     concluded that an impairment charge of 400 million 294 million
     aftertax was necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the
     telecommunications reporting unit to its estimated fair value of 16
     billion the decrease in fair value at the end of 2002 from that measured
     in the initial benchmark assessment on january 1 2002 primarily reflected
     the following

       a delay in the timing of the expected recovery from late 2002 or early
        2003 to 2005
       a reduction in the shortterm cash flow expectations of the fiber and
        cable business and a lower base from which the expected recovery will
        occur and
       a reduction in the short and longterm cash flow expectations of the
        photonic technologies product line

     we retained valuation specialists to assist in the valuation of our
     tangible and identifiable intangible assets for the purpose of determining
     the implied fair value of goodwill at december 31 2002

     2001 charge

     during the first half of 2001 we experienced a significant decrease in the
     rate of growth of our telecommunications segment primarily in the
     photonics technologies product line due to a dramatic decline in
     infrastructure spending in the telecommunications industry and determined
     that there were events of impairment within photonics we determined that
     our goodwill related to photonics was not recoverable under sfas no 121
     accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived
     assets to be disposed of which was the governing accounting principles
     generally accepted in the us gaap guidance at that time as a result
     we recorded a charge of 46 billion to impair a significant portion of
     goodwill of which 30 billion related to the pirelli transaction and 16
     billion related to goodwill resulting from the acquisition of netoptix
     corporation

     restructuring actions

     2003 restructuring actions

     corning recorded net charges of 49 million 14 million credit after tax
     and minority interest in 2003 major actions approved and initiated in
     2003 included the following

       the shutdown of cav which was a manufacturer of glass panel and funnels
        for use in conventional tube televisions within the technologies
        segment
       the sale and exit of our photonics products within the
        telecommunications segment and
       the shutdown of two of our specialty materials manufacturing facilities
        which are within the technologies segment

     restructuring charges
     
     the 2003 restructuring charges of 41 million included 90 million of
     employee separation costs including special termination and curtailment
     losses related to pension and postretirement health care plans and 37
     million in other exit costs principally lease termination and contract
     cancellation payments offset by an 86 million credit related to previous
     restructuring actions these credits were primarily the result of revised
     cost estimates of existing restructuring plans and a decision to not exit
     two small cabling sites the charge entailed the elimination of
     approximately 1975 hourly and salaried positions including involuntary
     separation early retirement and social programs in addition we recorded
     a 20 million foreign deferred tax benefit adjustment related to
     restructuring charges recorded in 2002 this credit is reflected in the
     consolidated statement of operations under benefit for income taxes

     impairment of plant and equipment to be shutdown or disposed
     
     corning recorded a net credit of 21 million in 2003 this included 40
     million of charges to impair plant and equipment related to facilities to
     be shutdown or disposed which comprised 11 million for the north
     brookfield semiconductor materials plant closure 14 million related to a
     cabling plant 10 million related to the final exit of photonics and 5
     million of other various costs the impairment charges were determined
     based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the fair market
     value of the asset the charge was more than offset by 61 million in
     credits related to previous restructuring actions these credits were
     primarily the result of our decision not to exit two of the previous
     cabling sites marked for shutdown in 2002 as well as proceeds on asset
     disposals exceeding assumed salvage values

     impairment of cost investments
     
     in the first quarter we recorded a 5 million charge for other than
     temporary declines in certain cost investments in the telecommunications
     segment in the third quarter we sold these investments for 4 million in
     cash which was 1 million more than previously expected we reported this
     gain as a credit to restructuring actions

     loss on sale of photonics
     
     we recorded a loss of 13 million in the third quarter when we completed
     the sale of certain photonic technologies assets to avanex in exchange for
     our photonics assets and 22 million in cash we received 21 million
     restricted shares of avanex common stock which we valued at approximately
     53 million these shares are restricted from sale for approximately one
     year at which point the restrictions are lifted at intervals beginning july
     2004 and ending october 2005 as the shares become unrestricted we will
     marktomarket the shares through other comprehensive income as
     availableforsale securities the avanex restricted shares are reflected
     as a cost investment and recorded under investments in our consolidated
     balance sheet approximately 400 employees of the photonic technologies
     products became employees of avanex in the third quarter the loss on sale
     included a 21 million reduction of our goodwill see notes 5
     restructuring actions and 10 investments of the consolidated financial
     statements for further detail

     in addition to these restructuring action costs we also incurred the
     following charges in our consolidated statement of operations related to
     the exit of photonics

       an increase to the deferred tax valuation allowance by 21 million as
        we do not expect to realize certain deferred tax assets in italy which
        is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations under
        benefit for income taxes and
       a 7 million impairment charge for equity investments that were
        abandoned as part of the exit from photonics which is reflected in the
        consolidated statement of operations under equity in earnings of
        associated companies net of impairments

     accelerated depreciation
     
     we recorded 12 million of accelerated depreciation as a result of our
     decision to shutdown our semiconductor materials manufacturing facility in
     charleston south carolina by march 31 2004 we will record an additional
     36 million in the first quarter of 2004 while the plant continues
     operating

     2002 restructuring actions

     the continued decline in demand in the telecommunications segment during
     2002 required additional restructuring beyond that taken in 2001 to bring
     manufacturing capacity in line with revenue projections we recorded total
     charges of 13 billion 929 million aftertax and minority interest over
     the second third and fourth quarters actions approved and initiated in
     2002 included the following

       permanent closing of our optical fiber manufacturing facilities in
        noble park victoria australia and neustadt bei coburg germany
        we also mothballed our optical fiber manufacturing facility in concord
        north carolina and transferred certain capabilities to our wilmington
        north carolina facility
       reductions in capacity and employment in our cabling and hardware and
        equipment locations worldwide to reduce costs
       permanent closure of our photonic technologies thin film filter
        manufacturing facility in marlborough massachusetts
       permanent abandonment of certain construction projects that had
        been stopped in 2001 in the fiber and cable business within
        the telecommunications segment
       closure of minor manufacturing facilities primarily in the
        telecommunications segment
       closure and consolidation of research facilities
       elimination of positions worldwide through voluntary and involuntary
        programs and
       divestiture of a portion of the controls and connectors product line
        in the telecommunications segment

     in addition we impaired cost based investments in a number of private
     telecommunications companies based upon a decision in the fourth quarter of
     2002 to divest the portfolio

     2001 restructuring actions

     in july and october of 2001 we announced a series of restructuring actions
     in response to significant deteriorating business conditions which began
     initially in our telecommunications segment but eventually spread to our
     other businesses as the year progressed the following actions were
     approved and undertaken in 2001

       closure of seven major manufacturing facilities and the consolidation of
        several smaller facilities in the telecommunications and technologies
        segments
       discontinuation of our initiative in corning microarray technology
        products part of our life sciences products and
       elimination of approximately 12000 positions affecting all operating
        segments but especially impacting the photonic technologies hardware
        and equipment and the optical fiber and cable products this action
        included a selective voluntary early retirement program for certain
        employees along with involuntary separations

     these actions resulted in a pretax charge totaling 953 million 585
     million aftertax for the year ended december 31 2001 approximately one
     third of the total charge was expected to be paid in cash

     impairment of longlived assets other than goodwill

     given our restructuring actions and the market conditions facing our
     businesses at various times throughout 2001 to 2003 we performed
     evaluations of the recoverability of our longlived assets in each case
     that an impairment evaluation was required we developed operating cash
     flow projections for each strategic alternative and made assessments as to
     the probability of each outcome if our projections indicated that our long
     lived assets were not recoverable through future cash flows we were then
     required to estimate the fair value of the longlived assets which were
     limited to property plant and equipment using the expected cash flow
     approach as a measure of fair value

     2003 impairment charge

     in april 2003 we announced that we had agreed with our partner to shutdown
     cav and wrote down its assets to their estimated salvage values this
     resulted in an impairment charge of 62 million 19 million aftertax and
     minority interest


page



     subsequent to our decision to exit cav signed a definitive agreement to
     sell tangible assets to henan anyang cpt glass bulb group electronic glass
     co ltd henan anyang located in china for amounts exceeding estimated
     salvage values upon the receipt of 10 million in cash we recognized a 5
     million credit in restructuring we expect the sale to be completed in the
     first half of 2004 at which time we anticipate recognizing an additional
     gain of approximately 40 million 13 million aftertax and minority
     interest

     2002 impairment charges

     photonic technologies
     
     in 2002 the telecommunications market underwent a dramatic decline in
     demand for its products as major buyers of network equipment in this
     industry reduced their capital spending this negative trend was expected
     to continue into the foreseeable future as a result of our impairment
     evaluation the photonics assets were written down to estimated salvage
     value as this amount was our best estimate of fair value this resulted in
     a 269 million 195 million aftertax write down of the longlived assets
     including 90 million related to patents

     conventional video components
     
     in 2002 the market was impacted by a decline in demand for conventional
     television glass and a dramatic increase in the importation of television
     glass tubes and sets from asia these trends were expected to continue
     into the foreseeable future as a result of our impairment evaluation
     cavs assets were written down to their estimated fair values this
     resulted in a 140 million 44 million aftertax and minority interest
     writedown of the assets

     2001 impairment charges

     photonic technologies
     
     in 2001 the telecommunications markets dramatic decline began we
     performed an asset impairment evaluation of our photonics product line and
     incurred a charge of 116 million to write down intangible assets to their
     estimated fair values

asbestos settlement

on march 28 2003 we announced that we had reached agreement with the
representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and
future nonpremises asbestos claims against us and pcc which might arise from
pcc products or operations

the agreement is expected to be incorporated into a settlement fund as part of a
reorganization plan for pcc the plan will be submitted to the federal
bankruptcy court in pittsburgh for approval and is subject to a number of
contingencies including a favorable vote by 75 of the asbestos claimants
voting on the pcc reorganization plan we will make our contributions to the
settlement trust under the agreement after the plan is approved becomes
effective and is no longer subject to appeal we expect the approval process to
be complete in 2004

when the plan becomes effective our settlement will require the contribution of
our equity interest in pcc our onehalf equity interest in pce and 25 million
shares of our common stock the common stock will be markedtomarket each
quarter until it is contributed to the settlement trust thus resulting in
adjustments to income and the settlement liability as appropriate we will also
make cash payments with a current value of 136 million over six years beginning
in june 2005 which we will accelerate as needed to maximize the related tax
benefits in addition we will assign insurance policy proceeds from our primary
insurance and a portion of our excess insurance as part of the settlement we
recorded an initial charge of 298 million in the first quarter of 2003 to
reflect the terms of the settlement and additional charges of 115 million to
reflect the mark to market of our common stock through december 31 2003 total
charges of 413 million 263 million aftertax were incurred for the twelve
months ended december 31 2003 this charge was previously reported as a
nonoperating charge in our 2003 quarterly reports on form 10q  effective with
this annual report on form 10k we have reclassified this charge to operating
expenses in the consolidated statements of operations the carrying value of our
investment in pce and the fair value of 25 million shares of our common stock
totaling 282 million have been reflected in current liabilities the remaining
136 million representing the net present value of the cash payments
discounted at 55 is recorded in noncurrent liabilities see legal proceedings
for a history of this matter

operating loss

we incurred an operating loss of 655 million in 2003 which was significantly
lower than the 2002 loss of 27 billion and the 2001 operating loss of 60
billion our loss in 2003 included the asbestos settlement charges  losses in
all three years included restructuring impairment and other charges and credits
as described above our results for 2001 were also impacted by an operating
charge of 333 million to writedown excess and obsolete inventory a 90
million charge related to the release of restrictions on shares of corning
common stock and a 28 million charge to writedown an investment in
intellectual property

gain on repurchases and retirement of debt net

during the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 we repurchased and retired a
significant portion of our zero coupon convertible debentures due november 8
2015 in 2003 we repurchased and retired 1531000 debentures with an accreted
value of 12 billion for cash of approximately 11 billion through open market
purchases and a public tender offer and recorded a net gain of 55 million we
also issued 65 million shares of common stock from treasury in exchange for
55000 debentures with an accreted value of 43 million and recognized a charge
of 35 million reflecting the fair value of the incremental shares issued beyond
those required by the terms of the debentures the increase in equity due to the

excluding these items our rate was 33 in 2003 30 in 2002 and 13 in
2001

sfas no109 accounting for income taxes sfas no 109 requires that a
valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a
portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized a review of all available
positive and negative evidence needs to be considered including a companys
current past and future predicted performance the market environment of the
industries in which the company operates the utilization of past tax credits
length of carryback and carryforward periods and existing contracts or sales
backlog that will result in future profits

at december 31 2003 we have recorded gross deferred tax assets of
approximately 21 billion with a valuation allowance of 469 million and
offset by deferred tax liabilities of 201 million the valuation allowance is
primarily attributable to the uncertainty regarding the realization of specific
foreign and state tax benefits net operating losses and tax credits the net
deferred tax assets of approximately 15 billion consist of a combination of
domestic us federal state and local and foreign tax benefits for a items
which have been recognized for financial reporting purposes but which will be
reported on tax returns to be filed in the future and b loss and tax credit
carryforwards as explained further below we have performed the required
assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the
net deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 109 this assessment
included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities
estimates of projected future taxable income and taxplanning strategies
although realization is not assured based on our assessment we have concluded
that it is more likely than not that such assets net of the existing valuation
allowance will be realized


page



net domestic deferred tax assets are approximately 13 billion at december 31
2003 approximately 460 million of these net deferred tax assets relate to loss
and tax credit carryforwards that expire through 2023 the remaining net
deferred tax assets comprise the following deductible temporary differences

1  other postretirement benefits of 244 million which will reverse over the
    next 40 to 50 years
2  restructuring and other liabilities of 155 million which will reverse over
    the next 10 years
3  research and development expenditures of 252 million which will reverse
    over the next 10 years and
4  other miscellaneous items of 178 million which will reverse on average
    over the next 10 years

approximately 10 of our net domestic deferred tax assets will be realized
through net operating loss carryback claims to be filed over the next three to
five years which will generate cash refunds during such period we expect the
remaining net domestic deferred tax assets to be realized from future earnings
however in the event future earnings are insufficient approximately 40 of our
net domestic deferred tax assets could be realized through a taxplanning
strategy involving the sale of a nonstrategic appreciated asset realization of
the remaining 50 of our net domestic deferred tax assets is solely dependent on
our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during carryforward
periods of approximately 20 years

the minimum amount of domestic future income that would have to be generated to
realize this portion of our deferred tax assets is 17 billion over at least 20
years currently we are generating domestic losses however our forecast of
domestic income indicates it is more likely than not that the future results of
operations in the us will generate sufficient taxable income to realize this
portion of our deferred tax assets specifically we expect to incur
significantly lower domestic losses in 2004 and to return to profitability in
the us in 2005 key assumptions embedded in these nearterm forecasts follow

1  our 2004 us losses will decrease as a result of the 2003 exit of the
    photonics technologies business and cav
2  we expect to see improved earnings trends in our telecommunications segment
    which is primarily in the us this includes a lower loss in 2004 and a
    return to profitability in 2005 this trend is partially being driven by the
    realization of lower operating costs as a result of prior years
    restructuring actions in addition we are forecasting revenue to be flat or
    down slightly in 2004 but significantly higher in 2005 due to an expected
    recovery in the telecommunications industry in 2005
3  our specialty materials semiconductor business will generate higher
    earnings in 2004 as a result of a recovery in the semiconductor equipment
    industry and lower operating costs as a result of the fourth quarter 2003
    restructuring actions which will be completed by the end of the first
    quarter of 2004
4  our display business will continue its rapid growth although this business
    is largely based in asia domestic earnings of this business have increased
    in 2003 and are expected to continue to increase over the next several
    years in part due to an increase in us royalty income
5  we will continue to sustain modest growth in our remaining domestic
    businesses and except for the restructuring actions announced prior to
    december 31 2003 we do not expect to incur any significant additional
    restructuring or impairment charges

our forecast of domestic income is based on assumptions about and current trends
in our operating segments and there can be no assurance that such results will
be achieved we review such forecasts in comparison with actual results and
expected trends quarterly for purpose of our recoverability assessment as a
result of this review if we determine that we will not return to profitability
in the us in 2005 or if sufficient future taxable income may not be generated
to fully realize the net deferred tax assets we will increase the valuation
allowance by a charge to income tax expense in an amount equal to the portion of
the deferred tax assets that are realizable solely through projected future
taxable income if we record such a valuation allowance we will also cease to
recognize additional tax benefits on any losses in the us

equity in earnings of associated companies net of impairments

equity earnings nearly doubled to 209 million in 2003 the increase was due to
the following

   the resumption of the recognition of equity earnings from dow corning in
    2003 added 82 million to equity earnings in 2003 in 1995 we fully
    impaired our investment in dow corning upon its entry into bankruptcy
    proceedings and did not recognize equity earnings from the second quarter
    of 1995 through the end of 2002 we began recognizing equity earnings in
    the first quarter of 2003 when we concluded that dow cornings emergence
    from bankruptcy protection was probable based on the bankruptcy courts
    findings on december 11 2002 see legal proceedings for a history of this
    matter

   our 50 owned samsung corning precision a south korean manufacturer of
    liquid crystal display glass increased its net income by 82 compared to
    2002 resulting in equity earnings 64 million higher than 2002 earnings
    in 2003 were 144 million

   these positive results were negatively impacted by samsung corning which
    recorded a significant asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter of
    2003 our portion of that charge was 66 million aftertax which
    resulted in a net equity loss of 39 million


page



equity earnings in 2002 were 116 million a decline of 22 from 2001 primarily
due to the impairment of an equity investment in the second quarter of 2002 for
14 million and a 20 million reduction in equity earnings in the fourth
quarter caused by restructuring and impairment charges recorded by samsung
corning micro optics a 50 owned manufacturer of photonics components

2003 vs 2002

sales in the segment declined 13 or 205 million compared to 2002 all
products in the segment incurred a decline in sales a portion of the decline
was in photonic technologies which we exited in july 2003 the remaining decline
in sales was due to price decreases for optical fiber and cable which were
partially offset by volume increases the segment incurred a loss of 169
million in 2003 compared to a net loss of 19 billion in the prior year

restructuring and impairment charges included a 13 million loss on the sale of
photonics technologies assets to avanex and 88 million for restructuring
charges offset by credits of 137 million resulting in net credits of 36
million all of the telecommunications products reported a loss in 2003
however the losses were significantly lower than those incurred in the prior
year the decrease in the loss over the prior year was primarily due to much
lower restructuring and impairment charges and cost savings resulting from these
actions

the following discussion of products in the telecommunications segment excludes
the restructuring and impairment charges and credits to provide clarity on the
underlying business trends

optical fiber and cable

sales declined 12 or 99 million compared to 2002 the decrease was primarily
due to pricing pressure particularly in fiber but was partially offset by
strong demand in japan and china primarily in the first quarter sales volume
increased almost 20 in 2003 compared to 2002 due primarily to having the full
year results of the chinese fiber and cable entities acquired from lucent in the
fourth quarter of 2002 volumes for our other fiber and cable facilities were up
slightly in 2003 compared to 2002 the loss for 2003 was significantly less than
2002 due to significant cost reduction

hardware and equipment

sales were relatively flat compared to 2002 decreasing 3 or 17 million the
sales decrease was primarily due to the overall lack of capital spending by our
customers impacting the entire telecommunications industry the loss for 2003
significantly decreased from the prior year due to cost reductions achieved from
the 2002 restructuring actions and other cost reduction initiatives

photonic technologies

on july 31 2003 we completed the sale of a significant portion of the photonic
technologies assets to avanex see restructuring impairment and other charges
and credits and note 5 restructuring actions to the consolidated financial
statements sales declined 51 or 57 million compared to 2002 due to lower
sales volume in the early part of the year as well as our exit of photonics
technologies in 2003 the loss in 2003 was more than 85 less than the prior
year loss due to cost savings resulting from restructuring actions taken in
2002 as well as the exit of this business in 2003

controls and connectors

sales decreased 29 or 32 million in 2003 compared to the prior year the
sales decline for the year was primarily due to the sale of the appliance
controls group in may 2002 and the lack of capital spending in the
telecommunications industry the controls and connectors product line incurred a
small loss in 2003 however the loss decreased significantly compared to the
prior year primarily due to cost savings from restructuring actions taken in
2002

2002 vs 2001

this segment incurred significant restructuring and impairment charges in 2002
and 2001 the 2002 and 2001 charges are described in detail in restructuring
impairment and other charges and credits the restructuring activities were
undertaken to reduce the operating cost structure due to continued market
declines more than half of the 2002 charge related to the impairment of fixed
assets primarily in the fiber and cable business a significant portion of the
asset impairments in this business represented the closure of two fiber plants
and permanent abandonment of certain construction projects the balance of the
charge represented impairments of cost based investments primarily in the
photonic technologies business and severance and benefits for retirees and
separated personnel in all businesses in addition the segment incurred a 400
million charge for the impairment of goodwill and a 269 million charge for
longlived asset impairments in photonic technologies the impairment charge
incurred in the second quarter of 2001 relates to goodwill and certain acquired
intangible assets from acquisitions in the photonic technologies business these
charges are described in notes 4 impairment of goodwill and 6 impairment of
other longlived assets to the consolidated financial statements

sales in the segment declined 63 or 2827 million compared to 2001 as each
product in the segment experienced a significant decline in volume with the
largest declines in optical fiber and cable and photonic technologies the
segment incurred losses of 19 billion in 2002 compared to a net loss of 52
billion in 2001 the 2002 loss was primarily due to the significant decrease in
sales volume and restructuring and impairment charges each product line
reported a loss in 2002 the trend between years reflected lower restructuring
and impairment charges excluding these restructuring and impairment charges
the segment net loss was 592 million compared to a loss of 81 million in 2001
the increase in the loss in 2002 reflected reduced sales volumes and lower
prices in each product line offset by cost reductions resulting from
restructuring actions

the following discussion of products in the telecommunications segment excludes
the restructuring and impairment charges and credits to provide clarity on the
underlying business trends

optical fiber and cable

sales declined 70 or 2030 million compared to 2001 the decrease was
primarily due to a sales volume decline of more than 50 for the year as well as
double digit price declines excluding restructuring and impairment charges the
optical fiber and cable product line incurred a significant loss in 2002
compared to profits in the prior year primarily due to significantly lower
sales volume declining prices and unfavorable product mix


page



as discussed in restructuring actions the optical fiber and cable product line
undertook significant restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of 2002 these
actions included permanent closure of two international fiber manufacturing
plants and the mothballing of the concord north carolina facility we believe
that the concord facility can be returned to productive capacity within six to
nine months of a decision to do so and construction in progress at the concord
facility can be completed efficiently we believe the concord and wilmington
plants will provide sufficient capacity for the foreseeable future

hardware and equipment

sales decreased 32 or 265 million compared to 2001 the sales decreases were
primarily due to the overall lack of spending impacting the entire
telecommunications industry excluding restructuring charges the product line
incurred a loss driven by lower volumes and pricing pressure in 2002 compared
to a near breakeven performance in 2001

photonic technologies

sales declined 80 or 436 million compared to 2001 primarily due to lower
sales volume as network buildouts in the telecommunications industry declined
resulting in much lower demand for photonic products the business incurred a
significant loss for 2002 primarily due to dramatically lower sales volumes
however the 2002 losses decreased more than 50 compared to the losses
incurred in 2001 which included inventory writedowns of 333 million the
results in 2002 reflected cost reductions resulting from restructuring actions
taken in 2001 and 2002

during the second quarter of 2002 we favorably resolved an open issue from the
second quarter of 2001 with a major customer resulting in the recognition of
revenue of 14 million and pretax income of 3 million this revenue was
recognized in part on shipment of inventory previously reserved in addition we
settled an open matter with a significant vendor in 2002 resulting in the
reversal of a vendor reserve of 20 million that was recorded as part of the
charge in the second quarter of 2001

controls and connectors

sales decreased 47 or 96 million compared to 2001 due to the sale of the
appliance controls group in may 2002 and reduced capital spending in the
telecommunications industry due to lower sales volumes a loss was incurred for
the year compared to earnings in 2001

outlook
the global telecommunications market downturn that began in 2001 continued into
2003 however we believe that conditions have begun to stabilize we ultimately
expect a recovery in 2005 and we believe 2004 will be comparable to 2003 we
expect 2004 sales to be flat to down slightly compared to 2003 although we
expect to see volumes in our hardware and equipment and fiber and cable
businesses to increase we will continue to experience pricing pressure but at
a lower level than in 2003 we expect a loss in 2004 however we believe it
will be significantly less than 2003 primarily due to the exit of the photonic
technologies product line and lower operating expenses reflecting cost savings
from restructuring actions taken in 2003 and 2002

technologies

the technologies segment manufactures specialized products with unique
properties for customer applications utilizing glass glass ceramic and polymer
technologies its primary products include liquid crystal display glass for flat
panel displays ceramic substrates for automobile and diesel applications
scientific laboratory products highpurity fused silica and other advanced
materials used for the manufacture of integrated circuits and glass panels and
funnels for televisions and cathode ray tubes in april 2003 we announced that
we had reached agreement with our partner to shutdown cav cav manufactured
conventional video components in north america and ceased operations on june 30
2003 we remain in this market through our equity investment in samsung corning

2003 vs 2002

sales in the technologies segment increased 8 or 128 million compared to
2002 increased sales in display technologies and environmental technologies
were partially offset by much lower sales in conventional video components that
we exited and lower sales in other technologies products segment earnings for
2003 were down 6 compared to the prior year improved operating performance
from display technologies and environmental technologies were partially offset
by the shutdown of cav and decreased earnings in the semiconductor materials
product line segment net income for 2003 included net restructuring impairment
and accelerated depreciation charges of 134 million primarily for the exit of
cav and the consolidation of our semiconductor manufacturing sites and a 66
million charge to equity earnings of samsung corning resulting from an asset
impairment charge compared to net restructuring impairment and other charges of
150 million in 2002 see restructuring impairment and other charges and
credits and note 5 restructuring actions to the consolidated financial
statements

the following discussion of products in the technologies segment excludes the
restructuring and impairment charges and credits to provide clarity on the
underlying business trends

display technologies

sales increased 47 or 190 million compared to 2002 the increase was
primarily due to volume gains of approximately 43 as penetration of liquid
crystal display panels in the desktop market increased and favorable exchange
rates earnings doubled in 2003 compared to the prior year due to the increase
in volume and significant gains in equity earnings from samsung corning
precision over the prior year

in july 2003 we announced an 180 million expansion of our liquid crystal
display glass manufacturing facility in taiwan the threephased project is
expected to be completed by the end of 2004 with production to begin in the
second quarter of 2004 in february 2004 we announced a 600 million expansion
of our liquid crystal display glass manufacturing facility in japan and taiwan
this expansion will occur over 2004 and 2005

environmental technologies

sales increased 21 or 82 million compared to 2002 the increased sales were
primarily due to increased us auto production driven by financing incentives
favorable mix of premium products favorable exchange rates and higher sales for
diesel products earnings decreased more than 38 compared to the prior year due
to a decrease in equity earnings from cormetech a us designer and
manufacturer of industrial catalysts and higher development spending for the
diesel product line

life sciences

sales were flat in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to weak sales in europe
and a general softness in the market earnings were flat compared to the prior
year primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and a gain on the
disposition of a minor product line that was more than offset by higher
development spending

conventional video components

sales decreased 61 or 101 million compared to 2002 the sales declines are
due to loss of volume price declines and our decision to exit cav as discussed
earlier we ceased operations in the second quarter of 2003 see restructuring
impairment and other charges and credits and note 5 restructuring actions to
the consolidated financial statements the loss increased compared to the prior
year primarily due to decreased sales volume continued competitive pricing
pressures and equity losses from samsung corning although samsung corning
generates cash we expect that our equity earnings from this venture will be
lower than historical levels going forward further it is possible that future
equity results may include operating losses or significant restructuring or
fixed asset impairment charges recorded by samsung corning our investment in
samsung corning was 320 million at december 31 2003


page



other technologies products

sales in our other technologies businesses including semiconductor materials
and ophthalmic products decreased 16 or 44 million compared to 2002 the
decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume of highpurity fused silica
products as capital spending in the semiconductor equipment industry remained
at relatively low levels and the exit of the lighting product line in september
2002 the losses from other technologies products more than tripled compared to
the prior year the losses were primarily due to significantly lower sales
volume and increased spending in development and engineering for calcium
fluoride products due to the cyclicality of the semiconductor equipment market
we are consolidating the semiconductor materials manufacturing facilities to
attain greater flexibility than we have in our current cost structure as a
result we recorded impairment and restructuring charges and accelerated
depreciation as discussed in restructuring actions and note 5 restructuring
actions to the consolidated financial statements

2002 vs 2001

sales in the technologies segment during 2002 decreased 4 or 55 million
compared to 2001 as increased sales in display technologies environmental
technologies and life sciences were offset by much lower sales in the mature
conventional video components product line decreased demand for semiconductor
materials and the impact of cornings exit of its lighting products line in
2002 segment earnings increased 29 or 27 million compared to 2001 as
improved operating performance in display technologies and life sciences and
stronger equity earnings were partially offset by restructuring and impairment
charges and decreased earnings in the semiconductor materials and conventional
video components products the 2002 restructuring costs recorded in this segment
consisted entirely of severance and benefits for retired and separated employees
in several businesses the impairment charges related to assets held for use
see impairment of longlived assets other than goodwill

the following discussion of products in the technologies segment excludes the
restructuring and impairment charges and credits to provide clarity on the
underlying business trends

display technologies

sales increased 25 or 82 million compared to 2001 the increase was
primarily due to higher sales volume as penetration in the desktop market
increased the prior years sales were negatively impacted by an inventory
correction in the industry in the first quarter of 2001 volume gains of over
46 for 2002 were partially offset by price declines of 10 on a constant
currency basis earnings increased over 30 in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily
due to volume gains and a more than 30 improvement in equity earnings from
samsung corning precision

environmental technologies

sales increased 4 or 15 million compared to 2001 primarily due to increased
us auto production driven by financing incentives and strong growth in europe
and japan earnings improved 8 compared to 2001 as a significant increase in
equity earnings from cormetech a us designer and manufacturer of industrial
catalysts was partially offset by price declines and increased manufacturing
and development costs related to new products

life sciences

sales increased 5 or 13 million compared to 2001 primarily due to strong
growth in most product lines earnings more than doubled over 2001 primarily
due to cost savings from the discontinuation of our investment in microarray
technology products in the third quarter of 2001 as well as improved
manufacturing efficiencies and higher sales

conventional video components

sales decreased 34 or 86 million compared to 2001 pricing pressure was
strong in this market due to increased competition a significant portion of
cavs business was concentrated with few customers two of which merged the
loss increased almost 50 for the year compared to 2001 primarily due to
decreased sales volume and continued competitive pricing pressures samsung
corning also experienced pricing pressure resulting in an approximate 10
decline in equity earnings for 2002 compared to the prior year

other technologies products

sales decreased 23 or 79 million compared to 2001 the decrease was led by
the exit of the lighting product line and lower sales volume of high purity
fused silica products as capital spending in the semiconductor equipment
industry remained at relatively low levels other technologies products incurred
a loss for the year compared to breakeven results in 2001 the losses were
primarily due to significantly lower sales volume and increased spending in
development and engineering for calcium fluoride products


page



outlook
we expect sales in the technologies segment to increase in 2004 primarily due
to continued growth in our display technologies product line and increased sales
of diesel products all products in this segment expect improved revenue in
2004 we also expect profitability in the segment to improve significantly in
2004 due to the strong volume growth in display technologies and increased
equity earnings from samsung corning precision

nonsegment results

our nonsegment results include the operations of steuben a crystal glass
manufacturer and equity earnings from nonstrategic investments that are not
aligned with our two operating segments in addition the results of operating
segments do not include amortization of goodwill gain on repurchases and
retirement of debt charges related to the asbestos litigation and restructuring
and impairment charges related to the corporate research and development or
staff organizations

liquidity and capital resources

financing structure

in 2003 we completed two equity offerings of our common stock as follows

  45 million shares in july for net proceeds of 363 million and
  50 million shares in may for net proceeds of 267 million

we used the net proceeds of the may offering and 356 million of existing cash
to reduce debt through a public tender offer conducted in june we used the net
proceeds of the july offering to reduce debt through open market repurchases
see note 17 shareholders equity to the consolidated financial statements

we repurchased and retired approximately 16 million zero coupon convertible
debentures in 2003 for approximately 11 billion in cash and 65 million shares
of treasury common stock see note 14 longterm debt and loans payable to the
consolidated financial statements for further detail

as a result of our debt repurchase program we reduced the balance of zero
coupon convertible debentures as follows

                         december 31 2003  december 31 2002  december 31 2001


zero coupon convertibles        385             1606             2059


the remaining zero coupon convertible debentures will likely be put back to us
on november 8 2005 at 81954 per debenture and on november 8 2010 at
90529 per debenture we have the option of settling this obligation in cash
common stock or a combination of both from time to time we may retire
additional debt securities for cash or equity

due to our debt ratings we continue to be precluded from accessing the
shortterm commercial paper market the terms that we could receive on any new
longterm debt issues would likely be consistent with those generally available
to highyield issuers

as an additional source of funds we currently have full unrestricted access to
a 2 billion revolving credit facility with 17 banks expiring on august 17
2005 as of december 31 2003 there were no borrowings under the credit
facility the facility includes one financial covenant limiting the ratio of
total debt to total capital as defined to not greater than 60 at december
31 2003 and december 31 2002 this ratio was 34 and 47 respectively

in march 2001 we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec
that became effective in the first quarter of 2001 the shelf permits the
issuance of up to 5 billion of various debt and equity securities as of
march 1 2004 our remaining capacity under the shelf registration statement
was approximately 29 billion

subsequent event

through march 1 2004 we repurchased and retired 25 thousand zero coupon
convertible debentures for approximately 19 million in cash resulting in a net
decrease of 20 million to the zero coupon convertible debenture book value in
addition we issued 22 million shares of corning common stock and 24 million in
cash in exchange for 35 convertible debentures with a book value of 213
million at an effective conversion price of 9675 per share as a result of
these transactions we will record a 23 million pretax loss on repurchases and
retirement of debt during the first quarter of 2004

capital spending

capital spending totaled 366 million 357 million and 17 billion in 2003
2002 and 2001 respectively our 2004 capital spending program is expected to be
in the range of 600 million to 650 million of which 425 million to 475
million will be to expand the capacity for liquid crystal display glass capital
spending activity in 2002 and 2003 primarily included expansion of liquid
crystal display capacity and new capacity for diesel substrates capital
spending in 2001 related primarily to the telecommunications segment

restructuring

during 2003 2002 and 2001 we made payments of 233 million 278 million and
77 million respectively related to employee severance and other exit costs
resulting from restructuring actions cash payments for employeerelated costs
and other exit costs will be substantially completed by the end of 2004 while
payments for exit activities will be substantially completed by the end of 2005

key balance sheet data

at december 31 2003 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled
13 billion compared with 21 billion at december 31 2002 the decrease from
december 31 2002 was primarily due to longterm debt repayments restructuring
payments capital expenditures and the use for working capital these items were
partially offset by the proceeds from the may and july equity offerings and the
receipt of a us federal tax refund of 191 million

our 2003 earnings were not adequate to cover our fixed charges principally
interest and related charges on debt primarily as a result of the asbestos
settlement charge losses incurred in the telecommunications segment and
restructuring and impairment charges we expect our full year 2004 earnings will
be sufficient to cover our fixed charges


page



management assessment of liquidity

our major source of funding for 2004 and beyond will be our existing balance of
cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments from time to time we may also
issue debt or equity securities to raise additional cash to fund a portion of
our capital expenditures related to our growth businesses we believe we have
sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations
restructuring the asbestos settlement research and development capital
expenditures and scheduled debt repayments we may accelerate some or all of the
funding of the cash payments to the asbestos settlement trust as needed to
maximize the tax benefits we can realize in connection with the related
settlement charges

off balance sheet arrangements

we have two variable interest entities vies that are not consolidated as we
are not the primarily beneficiary the assets and debt of these entities total
12 million our maximum loss exposure as a result of our involvement with these
vies is approximately 18 million this amount represents payments that would be
due to the lessor in the event of a total loss of the assets we carry insurance
coverage for this risk

we have provided other financial guarantees and have contingent liabilities in
the form of purchase price adjustments for acquisitions standby letters of
credit and performance bonds some of which do not have fixed or scheduled
expiration dates we have agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow
corning as discussed in note 10 investments to the consolidated financial
statements the funding of the dow corning credit facility is subject to events
connected to the bankruptcy plan we believe the significant majority of these
guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded

in january 2003 the sec released fr67 disclosure in managements discussion
and analysis about offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual
obligations in response to this guidance we have assessed our offbalance
sheet and contractual obligations and have determined that in addition to
previously disclosed items purchase obligations would be added given the
nature of purchase obligations we limited our assessment to individual items
outstanding at december 31 2003 greater than 1 million

pensions

we have a number of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and
international employees our largest single pension plan is cornings us
qualified plan at december 31 2003 this plan accounted for 82 of our
consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and 89
of the related plans assets in 2002 global capital market developments
resulted in negative returns on plan assets and a decline in the discount rate
used to estimate the related pension liability in 2003 although global
equities had positive returns interest rates continued to decline as a result
at december 31 2003 and 2002 the accumulated benefit obligation abo for our
domestic qualified and nonqualified plans and several international plans
exceeded the fair value of related plan assets which required corning to record
an additional minimum pension liability in accordance with sfas no 87
employers accounting for pensions

balances of these noncash adjustments follow in millions

                                                             december 31

we have traditionally contributed to the us qualified pension plan on an
annual basis in excess of the irs minimum requirements and as a result
mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan at least
until 2006 we contributed 160 million in 2003 to our us pension plan for
2004 we anticipate making voluntary contributions of at least 40 million to
this plan

critical accounting policies and estimates

the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates that required us
to make difficult subjective or complex judgments follow

impairment of goodwill

sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets requires us to make
certain difficult subjective and complex judgments on a number of matters
including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our
reporting units and the definition of our reporting units

we measure fair value on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows
our estimates are based upon our historical experience our current knowledge
from our commercial relationships and available external information about
future trends

the criteria for establishing a reporting unit is dependent upon how a company
determines its operating segments under sfas no 131 disclosures about
segments of an enterprise and related information  specifically sfas no 142
permits a company to define a reporting unit as either an operating segment a
component of an operating segment or an aggregation of two or more components
of an operating segment  the reporting unit for the telecommunications segment
goodwill is the telecommunications operating segment  the reporting units for
the technologies segment are components of the technologies segment  at
december 31 2003 the telecommunications and technologies operating segment
goodwill balances were 16 billion and 159 million respectively

during 2002 we completed our annual goodwill impairment test determined the
telecommunications goodwill balance was impaired and recorded a related
impairment charge of 400 million  our 2002 testing results also determined
that the technologies segment goodwill was not impaired  in the fourth quarter
of 2003 we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests and determined that
the goodwill balances were not impaired  as discussed in more detail below
while we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in
the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable we cannot provide assurance that
future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow
estimates as projected by management do not occur


page


we are currently in discussion with the staff of the sec on the determination
of our operating segments  we believe that our determination of our operating
segments under sfas no 131 is appropriate  however it is possible that the
outcome of this discussion could be a revision of how we define and disclose
our operating segments  it is also possible that a change in how we define our
telecommunications operating segment could impact our goodwill impairment tests
under sfas no 142  specifically we could be required to record a net
additional goodwill impairment charge of up to 600 million pre tax in 2002
although this potential charge would increase our 2002 net loss it would not
impact our 2002 operating cash flows because goodwill impairments are noncash
charges  our debt to capital ratio ranged from 44 to 47 throughout 2002
this potential charge would have increased our debt to capital ratio to no
higher than 51 which would still be below the 60 financial covenant limit
relating to our 20 billion revolving credit facility  the potential 2002
goodwill impairment charge would have no impact on operating results or
operating cash flows for the year ended december 31 2003

telecommunications

our expectation is that there will be minimal volume growth in the short term
volume growth is assumed to accelerate beginning in 2005 commensurate with
overall market recovery terminal value of the business assumes a growth in
perpetuity of 3 these cash flows are also used to value intangible and
tangible assets which determine the implied value of reporting unit goodwill
the discount rate applied to these cash flows represents a telecommunications
weighted average cost of capital based upon current debt and equity activity of
eleven public companies representing a cross section of worldwide competitors of
the reporting unit for our 2002 annual test we used a discount rate of 12 in
our calculation of fair value of the expected future cash flows an impairment
charge of 400 million was recorded in 2002 had we used a discount rate of
115 the fair value of the reporting unit would have exceeded its carrying
value and there would not have been impairment had we used a discount rate of
125 the pretax impairment charge would have been approximately 225 million
higher in 2003 we also used a 12 discount rate for our annual impairment
test the results of our test indicated that goodwill was not impaired the
results would not have changed had we used a discount rate of 115 or 125

technologies

due to market conditions we determined that a detailed impairment test of the
specialty materials reporting unit was required in the fourth quarter of 2003
while there was a significant decrease in sales in 2003 in this reporting unit
due to the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry we expect increased volume
growth beginning in 2004 our discounted cash flow test for this reporting unit
assumes a perpetuity growth rate of 3 the discount rate applied to the
forecasted cash flows represents weighted average cost of capital based upon
current debt and equity activity of eight public companies representing a cross
section of worldwide competitors of the reporting unit we used a discount rate
of 12 in our calculation of fair value of the expected future cash flows the
results of our test indicated that goodwill was not impaired the results would
not have changed had we used a discount rate of 115 or 125

impairment of assets held for use

sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets
requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived
assets when an event of impairment has occurred we must exercise judgment in
assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred for purposes of
recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets
is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which
identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other
assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level
for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of
other assets and liabilities we concluded events of impairment had occurred in
our semiconductor materials product line which is part of the specialty
materials business in the fourth quarter of 2003 and performed an impairment
test the results of our test indicated that our longlived assets held for use
were not impaired

in 2002 we recorded pretax charges totaling 409 million primarily related to
the photonics and conventional television product lines in each circumstance
behavior of external parties including customers and competitors were
considered in the determination of whether an impairment was required we also
exercised judgment in the determination of expected future cash flows against
which to compare the carrying value of the asset group being evaluated for the
impairment in 2002 we exercised judgment in determining the fair value of the
assets from which the impairment charge was measured for our photonic
technologies products we based the fair value of our longlived assets on the
actual results of recent asset auctions of similar equipment for the assets
related to our conventional television product line we exercised judgment about
alternative volume and sales price scenarios computed discounted cash flows
and assigned our best estimate of probability to each alternative we reduced
the useful lives of the fixed assets of cav as a result of this assessment


page


restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions

during 2003 and 2002 we recorded writedowns of property plant and equipment
as a result of decisions to exit facilities primarily in the telecommunications
segment assets impaired were primarily equipment construction in progress and
buildings which were sold or abandoned we used information available from
recent auctions of telecommunications equipment to estimate salvage value when
measuring impairment the estimated salvage values were very low primarily due
to the depressed market for telecommunications related equipment the salvage
values of property impaired were also estimated to be minimal as certain
facilities will be abandoned and not sold we have had significant reversals in
2003 and it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and
require adjustments to reserves

valuation allowances for deferred income taxes

sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes requires us to exercise judgment
about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax
assets at december 31 2003 corning had gross deferred tax assets of 21
billion we determined that the likelihood of realization of certain deferred
tax assets is less than 50 and recorded valuation allowances of 469 million
if future taxable income differs from our estimate adjustments to these
allowances will be required and will impact future net income see income taxes
and note 9 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further
detail

probability of litigation outcomes

sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies requires us to make judgments about
future events that are inherently uncertain in making determinations of likely
outcomes of litigation matters we consider the evaluation of outside counsel
knowledgeable about each matter as well as known outcomes in case law see
legal proceedings for a detailed discussion of the key litigation matters we
face the most significant matter involving judgment is the pcc asbestos
liability there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability
including the inherent complexity of a chapter 11 filing our history of success
in defending ourself against asbestos claims our assessment of the strength of
our corporate veil defenses our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers
and the claimants representatives and other factors we have reached a
tentative settlement on pcc as disclosed in legal proceedings and note 10
investments to the consolidated financial statements the settlement is
subject to a number of contingencies including a favorable vote by 75 of the
asbestos claimants voting on the pcc plan and approval by the bankruptcy court

pension assumptions

in 2002 we made a change in assumption that impacted pension expense in future
periods specifically we lowered our expected longterm rate of return on
pension assets from 9 to 85 we did not alter the nature of the pension trust
investments asset performance in 2002 had been below the 9 assumption as
such we lowered our longterm rate of return assumption in 2003 this
increased our pension expense as measured in accordance with sfas no 87
employers accounting for pension compared to amounts recorded in 2002 the
increase was approximately 8 million in 2003 in 2003 our actual return on
plan assets approximated 20 however we will continue to hold our expected
longterm rate of return at 85

environment

we have been named by the environmental protection agency under the superfund
act or by state governments under similar state laws as a potentially
responsible party for twelve active hazardous waste sites under the superfund
act all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site
identified by such agency are jointly and severally liable for the cost of
cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise it is our policy to accrue for its
estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental
liabilities related to property owned and operated by us based on expert
analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants we
have accrued approximately 21 million for our estimated liability for
environmental cleanup and related litigation at december 31 2003 based upon
the information developed to date we believe that the accrued amount is a
reasonable estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in
an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote

new accounting standards

in december 2003 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a
revised sfas no 132 employers disclosures about pensions and other
postretirement benefits the revised standard requires incremental pension and
other postretirement benefit plan disclosures to financial statements and is
designed to improve disclosure transparency the adoption of this accounting
standard did not have any effect on our results of operations or financial
position


page


in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of
variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin
no 51 fin 46 which requires all vies to be consolidated by the primary
beneficiary the primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of
the beneficial interests in the vie in addition the interpretation expands
disclosure requirements for both vies that are consolidated as well as vies from
which the entity is the holder of a significant but not the majority amount of
the beneficial interests we have leased equipment from three vies for which the
sole purpose is the leasing of equipment to us we assessed the impact of this
interpretation and determined that we are the primary beneficiary of one of
these existing vies and therefore began to consolidate this entity beginning
on july 1 2003 at december 31 2003 the assets and debt of this entity were
31 million and 34 million respectively we also evaluated the impact of this
interpretation on the two other entities and determined that we are not the
primary beneficiary for either entity the assets and debt of these entities
total 12 million the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material
effect on our results of operations or financial position

in addition we adopted the following new standards in 2003 which did not have
a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations

  sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations
  sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal
   activities
  fasb interpretation no 45 guarantors accounting and disclosure
   requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness
   of others fin 45
  sfas no 149 amendment of sfas no 133 on derivative instruments and
   hedging activities and
  sfas no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with
   characteristics of both liabilities and equity

item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks


we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are
exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates our exposure to
exchange rate effects includes

  exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions
   denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings and
  exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets in foreign subsidiaries
   for which the functional currency is not the us dollar which impact our
   net equity

our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to japan korea taiwan
and western european countries we selectively enter into foreign exchange
forward and option contracts with durations generally 15 months or less to hedge
our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases the
hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying
foreign currency commitments and transactions the objective of these contracts
is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results
we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise
where our foreign subsidiaries or corning enter into lending situations
generally on an intercompany basis denominated in currencies other than their
local currency we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
trading purposes

equity in earnings of associated companies has historically contributed a
significant amount of our income from continuing operations equity in earnings
of associated companies net of impairments was 209 million in 2003 with
foreignbased affiliates comprising over 50 of this amount samsung corning and
samsung corning precision totaled 105 million in equity earnings for 2003
exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities to
reduce this risk can affect the earnings of these companies

we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our
foreign currency exchange risk market risk is defined as the potential change
in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in
foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2003 we had open forward
contracts open option contracts foreign denominated debt with values exposed
to exchange rate movements all of which were designated as hedges at december
31 2003 a 10 adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could
result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 116 million

the nature of our foreign exchange rate risk exposures has not changed
materially from december 31 2002

interest rate risk management

in march and april of 2002 we entered into three interest rate swaps that are
fair value hedges and economically exchanged a notional amount of 275 million
of fixed rate longterm debt to floating rate debt under the terms of the swap
agreements we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the
sixmonth libor rate and receive the fixed rates of 83 to 8875 which are
the stated interest rates on the longterm debt instruments as a result of
these transactions corning was exposed to the impact of interest rate changes
the interest rate on these instruments is reset every six months and they
expire in 14 to 23 years

in september 2003 we terminated two of the interest rate swap agreements
described above with a notional amount of 150 million the termination of these
swaps resulted in a 15 million gain which we will amortize to earnings as a
reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt the cash
proceeds from the termination of the swap agreement totaled 17 million and is
included in the financing section of our consolidated cash flow statement as of
december 31 2003 we have one remaining swap agreement in effect with a
notional amount of 125 million

it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest
rates our policy sets a maximum cap that total variable rate debt will not
exceed 35 of the total debt portfolio at anytime at december 31 2003 our
consolidated debt portfolio contained approximately 6 of variable rate
instruments

    and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule
    13a15e under the securities and exchange act of 1934 the exchange
    act as of the year ended december 31 2003 the end of the period

    officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the evaluation
    date our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or
    submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms

b changes in internal controls

    during the quarter ended december 31 2003 there has been no change in
    our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule
    13a15f under the exchange act that has materially affected or is
    reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over

competition

corning  competes  across  all of its  product  lines with many large and varied
manufacturers  both domestic and foreign  some of these competitors are larger
than corning and some have broader product lines

telecommunications segment

competition  within the  telecommunications  industry is intense  among  several
significant companies  corning is a leading or one of the leading competitors
in the segments  principal product lines price and new product innovations are
significant  competitive factors the current downturn in the telecommunications
industry  particularly in europe and north america has changed the competitive
landscape  by  increasing  competition  based upon  pricing  these  competitive
conditions may persist

corning  is  the  largest  producer  of  optical  fiber  and  cable  but  faces
significant  competition  due to excess  capacity  in the  market  place  price
pressure and new product  innovations  corning  obtained the first  significant
optical  fiber  patents and believes its large scale  manufacturing  experience
fiber process technology leadership and intellectual property assets yield cost
advantages  relative  to  several  of its  competitors  the  primary  competing
producers  of optical  fiber are  furukawa  ofs  fujikura  sumitomo  alcatel
pirelli and draka  furukawa ofs is cornings  largest  competitor  for optical
fiber cable cornings primary competitors are furukawa ofs pirelli  alcatel
alcoa fujikura and sumitomo

communications  marconi avaya ppc thomas and betts cdi andrews corporation
and rosenberger  for photonic technologies  products the largest competitor is
jds  uniphase  and  other  competitors  include  furukawa   sumitomo   bookham
technologies plc alcatel optronics and triquint semiconductor

technologies segment

cornings  principal  products  face  competition  from a variety  of  materials
manufacturers  some of which  manufacture  similar products made from materials
other than glass and ceramics among other things innovation  product quality
performance and service are key competitive elements

corning is the largest  worldwide  producer of advanced  liquid crystal  display
glass substrates and that market position  remained  relatively  stable over the
past year  corning  believes it has  competitive  advantages in liquid  crystal
display glass substrates by investing in new technologies offering a consistent
source of reliable supply using its proprietary fusion manufacturing process at
facilities in kentucky  japan and korea and delivering thinner  lighter weight
and larger size products  asahi glass  nippon electric glass and nh techno are
cornings  principal  competitors in the display glass substrates  business  in
addition new entrants are seeking to expand their presence in this business

in the worldwide automotive ceramic substrates  business  corning has a leading
market position that has remained  relatively stable over the past year corning
believes  its  competitive   advantage  in  automotive  ceramic  substrates  for

corning is a leading supplier of glass and plastic science laboratory  products
with a growing glass market  presence in north  america and a relatively  stable
laboratory  plastic  market  presence  during  the past year  corning  seeks to
maintain  competitive  advantages  relative to its  competitors  by  emphasizing
product quality  product availability  supply chain efficiency a wide product
line and superior product attributes for laboratory products schott glaswerke
kavalier  kimble  and  becton  dickinson   co  are  the  principal  worldwide
competitors

corning  asahi  video  products  company  is  the  second  largest  producer  of
conventional television glass in north america its market position has declined
as the market shifted from conventional  cathode ray tubes to flat panel cathode
ray tubes and other technologies and as additional competition has emerged from
tube suppliers based in china  samsung corning corporation is the third largest
worldwide producer of cathode ray tube glass for conventional  televisions  its
relative  competitive  position has remained stable over the past year  samsung
corning  corporation  and corning asahi video products  company seek to maintain
their competitive advantage through customer support  logistics expertise and a
lower cost manufacturing  structure  for conventional  television glass nippon
electric  glass  techneglas  as well as various  asian  manufacturers  are the
competitors

corning  is a  leading  supplier  of  materials  for  lithography  optics in the
semiconductor  industry  and that market  position  remained  relatively  stable
during the past year  corning  seeks to compete by providing  superior  optical
quality  and a local corning presence  supporting its customers  for cornings
materials for  semiconductor  stepper  lenses and  ophthalmic  products  schott
glaswerke is the main competitor

corning  strives  to  maintain  its  position  through  technology  and  product
innovation  for the future  corning believes its competitive advantage lies in
its  commitment to research and  development  its  financial  resources and its
commitment  to  quality  there is no  assurance  that  corning  will be able to
maintain its market position or competitive advantage

raw materials

cornings  production  of  specialty  glasses  and  related  materials  requires
significant quantities of energy and batch materials

although energy shortages have not been a problem recently corning has achieved
flexibility  through  important  engineering  changes to take  advantage  of the
lowestcost energy source in most significant processes specifically cornings
principal manufacturing processes can now be operated with natural gas propane
oil or electricity or a combination of these energy sources

as  to  resources  ores   minerals   and  processed  chemicals  required  in
manufacturing  operations   availability  appears  to  be  adequate  cornings
suppliers  from time to time may  experience  capacity  limitations in their own
operations  or may  eliminate  certain  product  lines  nevertheless  corning
believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch chemicals
and raw materials for many products corning has alternative glass compositions
that would allow  operations to continue  without  interruption  in the event of
specific materials shortages

certain key optical  components  used in the  manufacturing  of products  within
cornings telecommunications segment are currently available only from a limited
number of sources  any future  difficulty  in obtaining  sufficient  and timely
delivery  of  components  could  result  in  delays  or  reductions  in  product
shipments or reduce cornings gross margins

patents and trademarks

inventions by members of cornings research and engineering staff have been and
continue to be important to the companys growth  patents have been granted on
many of these inventions in the united states and other countries some of these
patents have been licensed to other  manufacturers  including  cornings equity
investees  many of the earlier patents have now expired  but corning continues
to seek and obtain patents  protecting its newer  innovations  in 2002 corning
was  granted  over 350  patents  in the united  states  and over 600  patents in
countries outside the united states

each  business  segment   possesses  its  own  patent  portfolio  that  provides
competitive   advantage  in  protecting  cornings   innovations   corning  has
historically  enforced  and will continue to enforce its intellectual property
rights  at the end of 2002  corning  and its  subsidiaries  owned  over  5000
patents in various  countries  of which over 1900 were united  states  patents
between 2003 and 2005  approximately 5 of these patents will expire  while at
the same time corning intends to seek patents  protecting its newer innovations
worldwide  corning has over 5000 patent applications in process with over 750
in process in the us as a result  corning  believes that its patent portfolio
will  continue  to  provide a  competitive  advantage  in  protecting  cornings
innovation  although  cornings  competitors  in  each  of its  businesses  are
actively seeking patent protection as well

has entered into cross licensing  arrangements with some major competitors  but
the  scope of such  licenses  has been  limited  to  specific  product  areas or
technologies

most of cornings products are marketed under the following trademarks corning
celcor eagle 2000 eagle apt hpfs leaf pyrex smf28 steuben and vycor

protection of the environment

corning  has a program to ensure  that its  facilities  are in  compliance  with
state federal and foreign pollutioncontrol  regulations this program resulted
in capital and operating expenditures during the past several years in order to
maintain  compliance with such regulations  capital  expenditures for pollution
control in continuing  operations were  approximately 6 million in 2002 and are
estimated to be 11 million in 2003

cornings 2002 operating  results from  continuing  operations were charged with
approximately  33 million for  depreciation  maintenance  waste  disposal and
other operating  expenses  associated with pollution  control  corning believes
that its compliance program will not place it at a competitive disadvantage

risk factors

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report  and in other  documents we
file with the sec are some of the principal risks and uncertainties  that could
cause our actual business results to differ materially from any  forwardlooking
statements or other  projections  contained in this annual report  in addition
future  results  could be  materially  affected by general  industry  and market
conditions  general  us  and  nonus  economic  and  political  conditions
including a global economic slowdown  fluctuation of interest rates or currency
exchange rates terrorism  political unrest or international conflicts natural
disasters  or other  disruptions  of expected  economic  conditions  these risk
factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary  comments  concerning
forwardlooking  statements  in this  report  including  statements  related to
markets for our  products  and trends in our  business  that involve a number of
risks  and  uncertainties   our  separate  statement  labeled   forwardlooking
statements should be considered in addition to the statements below



page



our  sales  could be  negatively  impacted  if one or more of our key  customers
substantially reduce orders for our products

     our customer base is relatively  concentrated with less than 10 significant
customers  accounting for a high  percentage  greater than 50 of net sales in
most of our businesses  however  no individual customer accounts for more than
10 of consolidated sales

     over recent periods most of our major customers in the  telecommunications
segment  have  reduced  their  purchases  of our  products  and  have  expressed
uncertainty  as to their  future  requirements  as a  result  our  sales  have
declined and it is difficult to predict future sales accurately  the conditions
contributing to this difficulty include

         the prolonged downturn in the telecommunications industry
         uncertainty   regarding  the  capital  spending  plans  of  the  major
          telecommunications  carriers upon which our customers and ultimately
          we depend for sales
         the telecommunications carriers current limited access to the capital
          required for expansion and
         general market and economic uncertainty

     while we have responded to the depressed market by reducing excess capacity
and cutting  costs  we cannot  assure you that our plans will be  successful in
mitigating the adverse effects of a prolonged downturn  the current downturn in
the telecommunications  industry may be more severe and prolonged than expected
if our net sales continue to decline our ability to meet financial expectations
for future periods may be impaired

     in  our  technologies  segment  several  of  our  businesses  also  have a
concentrated   customer  base  these  businesses   include   cornings  display
technologies  environmental products and semiconductor materials if we lose a
significant  customer in any of these businesses  our sales could be negatively
impacted in the conventional video components business  one major customer has
already exited this market and demand from another key customer is uncertain as
discussed in item 7 under  impairment of longlived  assets other than goodwill
and note 6 to the  consolidated  financial  statements  the  loss of sales  may
require us to record additional impairment charges or exit this business

if we do not  successfully  adjust  our  manufacturing  volumes  and fixed  cost
structure  or achieve  manufacturing  yields or sufficient product reliability
our operating results could suffer

     in the economic and industry downturn for our  telecommunications  segment
we have responded to the softer market by cutting costs including the reduction
of our  manufacturing  volumes  we have continued to execute our  restructuring
plans in 2002 and into 2003 we have closed two fiber  facilities and mothballed
another and closed several  factories that made  photonics  cabling or hardware
and  equipment   we  announced  plans  in  2002  to  reduce  our  workforce  by
approximately  7100 positions by early 2003 although we expect to complete our
planned restructuring and facility consolidation  activities we may not achieve
all of the cost  reductions  that we  anticipate  we cannot assure you that our
plans will be successful in mitigating  the adverse  effects of a softer market
nor can we  assure  you that  additional  adjustments  and  charges  will not be
necessary to respond to further market changes

     the  manufacturing  of our  products  involves  highly  complex and precise
processes requiring production in highly controlled and clean environments any
changes  in  our  manufacturing  processes  or  those  of  our  suppliers  could
significantly reduce our manufacturing  yields and product reliability  in some
cases existing  manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the volume or cost
targets of our customers  we will need to develop new  manufacturing  processes
and techniques to achieve targeted volume and cost levels  while we continue to
fund projects to improve our manufacturing  techniques and processes we may not
achieve cost levels in our manufacturing  activities that will fully satisfy our
customers

we have incurred and may in the future incur  restructuring and other charges
the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately

     the  telecommunications  industry was  severely  hampered in 2002 by excess
manufacturing capacity  increased intensity of competition and growing pressure
in price and profits these negative trends are expected to continue in 2003 in
2002  we  recorded  charges  for  restructuring  impairment  of assets and the
writeoff  of cost  based  investments  management  is  considering  additional
actions and  strategic  options for its photonic  technologies  business  it is
possible  that  additional  impairments  restructuring  charges  and  inventory
writedowns will result from these actions

     our  ability to  forecast  our  customers  needs for our  products  in the
current  economic  and  industry  environment  is  limited  our results in 2002
included  significant charges for impairment of longlived assets  primarily in
the  conventional  television  glass and photonic  technologies  businesses  if
adverse  trends  continue in these  businesses  it is possible that  additional
charges may be taken


page



     corning  may record  additional  charges for  restructuring  or other asset
impairments if additional  actions become necessary to respond to align costs to
a reduced level of demand

     in the  event we incur  continued  operating  losses  we may be  unable to
recognize  future  deferred tax assets and may be required to make an assessment
of our ability to realize the deferred tax assets already recorded

if the  markets for our  products  do not  develop and expand as we  anticipate
demand for our products may decline further  which would negatively  impact our
results of operations and financial performance

     the  markets  for  our  products  are  characterized  by  rapidly  changing
technologies   evolving   industry   standards   and   frequent   new   product
introductions  our success is expected to depend  in substantial  part on the
timely and successful introduction of new products upgrades of current products
to comply with emerging industry standards  our ability to acquire technologies
needed to remain  competitive and our ability to address competing  technologies
and products in addition the following factors related to our products and the
markets for them if not achieved  could have an adverse  impact on our results
of operations and financial performance

         our ability to introduce leading products such as optical fiber glass
          for flat panel displays and environmental substrate products that can
          command competitive prices in the marketplace
         our ability to maintain  or achieve a favorable  mix of sales  between
          premium and nonpremium products
         our ability to  continue  to develop new product  lines to address our
          customers  diverse needs within the several market  segments in which
          we participate  this requires a high level of innovation  as well as
          the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends or
         our  ability  to  create  the   infrastructure   required  to  support
          anticipated growth in certain businesses

cornings  reduced  investment in research  development and  engineering  could
limit our ability to develop new products for the future

we face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely
affect our results of operations and financial performance

     we periodically face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses as
a result of intense  competition  emerging new technologies  or overcapacity
while we will work toward reducing our costs to respond to the pricing pressures
that may  continue  we may not be able to achieve  proportionate  reductions in
costs  as a result  of  overcapacity  and the  current  economic  and  industry
downturn in the telecommunications segment pricing pressures increased in 2002
particularly  in our optical  fiber and cable  business  pricing  pressures are
expected to continue in 2003 pricing pressure has also increased in our display
glass business as the  manufacturers  of desktop displays strive to reduce their
costs

we have  incurred  and may in the future incur  goodwill and other  intangible
asset impairment charges

     acquisitions  recorded as purchases for accounting  purposes have resulted
and in the future may  result  in the  recognition  of  significant  amounts of
goodwill and other  purchased  intangibles  the  potential  impairment of these
assets could reduce our net income and shareholders equity

     in june 2001 the financial  accounting standards board issued statement of
financial accounting standards sfas no 142 pursuant to which goodwill will no
longer be amortized  but will be subject to impairment tests at least annually
sfas no 142 was effective for us on january 1 2002

     management  completed the impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2002 and
recorded  required  goodwill  impairment  charges  totaling 400 million for the
telecommunications  segment  while we believe the estimates and judgments about
future cash flows in the telecommunications segment are reasonable no assurance
can be given that the  businesses in this segment will  stabilize and recover as
projected  we cannot provide assurance that future impairment  charges will not
be required if the telecommunications  industry does not recover as projected by
management in its expected cash flow estimates

we may be limited in our ability to obtain  additional  capital on  commercially
reasonable terms

     although we believe  existing cash  shortterm  investments  and borrowing
capacity  collectively  provide adequate  resources to fund ongoing  operating
requirements  we may be  required  to  seek  additional  financing  to  compete
effectively in our markets  our public debt ratings affect our ability to raise
capital and the cost of such capital  in july 2002 fitch downgraded our senior
unsecured  longterm debt rating from bbb to bb  standard  poors  downgraded
our senior unsecured  longterm debt rating from bbb to bb and shortterm debt
credit rating from a3 to b and moodys reduced our senior unsecured  longterm
debt rating from baa3 to ba2 and  shortterm  debt credit rating from prime3 to
not prime all of the rating agencies have maintained  negative outlooks  these
and any further  downgrades  may  increase  our  borrowing  costs and affect our
ability to access the debt  capital  markets  in  addition  the pricing of our
common stock may limit our ability to access the equity capital  markets without
a significant dilution to current shareholders
     as a result of our lower  debt  ratings  we may face  difficulties  in our
business  for  example  we may  face  increasing  requirements  to  post  cash
collateral  for  performance  bonds  and some  customers  may  seek  alternative
suppliers
     we are subject  under our  revolving  credit  facility  to a covenant  that
requires us to maintain a ratio of total debt to capital  as defined  under the
credit  facility  of not greater  than 060 to 100  our total debt to capital
ratio was 047 at december 31 2002 this covenant may also limit our ability to
borrow  additional  funds  further declines in our  telecommunications  segment
could  cause   impairments  of  goodwill   tangible  or  intangible  assets  or
restructuring charges related to our overall business additional impairments or
charges  could  materially  increase  our total debt to capital  ratio which may
reduce the amounts we are able to borrow under the revolving credit facility

if  our  products  or  components   purchased  from  our  suppliers   experience
performance issues our business will suffer

     our  business   depends  on  the   production  of  excellent   products  of
consistently  high  quality  to this end our  products  including  components
purchased  from  our  suppliers  are  tested  for  quality  both  by us and our
customers  nevertheless  our  products are highly  complex and our  customers
testing  procedures  are limited to  evaluating  our  products  under likely and
foreseeable failure scenarios for various reasons including among others the
occurrence of performance problems  unforeseeable in testing  our products and
components  purchased  from our  suppliers  may  fail to  perform  as  expected
performance  issues could result from faulty design or problems in manufacturing
or testing  we have experienced such performance  issues in the past and remain
exposed  to  such  performance  issues  in some  cases  product  redesigns  or
additional  capital  equipment may be required to correct a defect in addition
any significant or systemic  product failure could result in customer  relations
problems and harm the future sales of our products

interruptions  of  supplies  from our key  suppliers  may affect our  results of
operations and financial performance

     interruptions  of supplies from our key suppliers could disrupt  production
or impact our ability to increase production and sales we do not have longterm
or volume purchase agreements with every supplier  and may have limited options
for alternative supply if these suppliers fail for any reason  including their
business  failure  or  financial   difficulties   to  continue  the  supply  of
components

we face intense competition in most of our businesses

     we  expect  that  we  will  face  additional   competition   from  existing
competitors  and from a number of companies that may enter our markets  because
some of the markets in which we compete have been historically  characterized by
rapid growth and are  characterized by rapid technology  changes  smaller niche
and startup  companies may become our principal  competitors in the future  we
must invest in research and development  expand our engineering  manufacturing
and marketing capabilities and continue to improve customer service and support
in order to remain competitive  while we expect to undertake the investment and
effort in each of these areas we are reducing our expenditure levels and cannot
assure you that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position
in particular  the net losses in our  telecommunications  segment may constrain
our  ability  to  invest  as much as we would  like in each of these  areas  in
addition  while some of our competitors are similarly  experiencing the effects
of  this  market  turmoil   they  may  have  greater  financial   engineering
manufacturing marketing or other support resources

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and
we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual  property rights
of others

     we may encounter  difficulties  in  protecting  our  intellectual  property
rights or obtaining  rights to  additional  intellectual  property  necessary to
permit us to continue or expand our  businesses  we cannot  assure you that the
patents that we hold or may obtain will provide  meaningful  protection  against
our  competitors  or  competitive  technologies  litigation may be necessary to
enforce our intellectual  property  rights  to protect our trade secrets and to
determine  the  validity  and scope of our  proprietary  rights  litigation  is
inherently  uncertain and the outcome is often  unpredictable  other  companies
hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking
to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios
     the  intellectual  property  rights of others could  inhibit our ability to
introduce new products  we are and may in the future be  subject to claims of
intellectual  property infringement or misappropriation and we cannot assure you
as to the outcome of such claims litigation or claims against us could force us
to cease selling or using any of our products that  incorporate the intellectual
property  that is the  subject  of such  claims  obtain a license  from a third
party  or redesign or rename our products  these actions  if possible  could
result in substantial costs or loss of revenue

current or future  litigation  may harm our  financial  condition  or results of
operations

     pending   threatened   or  future   litigation   is  subject  to  inherent
uncertainties our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely
affected by unfavorable outcomes expenses and costs exceeding amounts estimated
or  insured  in  particular  we have been  named as a  defendant  in  numerous
lawsuits  against  pittsburgh  corning  corporation and several other defendants
involving  claims  alleging  personal  injury  from  exposure  to  asbestos  as
described  in  legal  proceedings  in  our  reports  filed  with  the  sec  our
negotiations  with the  representatives  of  asbestos  claimants  have failed to
produce a settlement to date and it currently  appears more likely than not that
we will litigate these cases alternatively in the event that we reach a global
settlement through the pittsburgh corning corporation  bankruptcy  process  the
outcome may be material  to the  results of  operations  for the period in which
such costs if any are recognized management expects that any aftertax charge
resulting from cornings  contributions  as part of a possible  settlement could
approximate  125  million to 175  million  and will  depend upon the timing of
contributions  and  relative  participation  if  any  of  insurance  carriers
management  cannot provide  assurances that the ultimate outcome of a settlement
would be within this range

we face risks related to our international operations and sales

     we have customers located outside the united states as well as significant
nonunited states operations  including  manufacturing and sales we have large
manufacturing   operations  in  the  asianpacific   region   including  equity
investments  in  companies  operating in south  korea  and several  significant
customers  are  located  in  this  region  as  a  result  of  these  and  other
international operations we face a number of risks including

         difficulty of effectively managing our diverse global operations
         change in regulatory requirements
         tariffs and other trade barriers
         political and economic instability in foreign markets and
         fluctuations  in foreign  currencies  which may make our products less
          competitive  in countries in which local  currencies  decline in value
          relative to the dollar

if we fail to retain and attract key  personnel  our results of operations  and
financial performance may suffer

     our future  success will be determined in part by our ability to retain and
attract key scientific and technical personnel for our research development and
engineering efforts our business also depends on the continued contributions of
our  executive  officers  and  other  key  management  we may also find it more
difficult to retain or attract qualified  employees due to our uncertain outlook
and  reductions   affecting   compensation   benefits   and  employee   equity
participation  programs  while  we  believe  that we have  been  successful  in
retaining  and  attracting  key  personnel  we cannot  assure  you that we will
continue to be successful in the future

if the  financial  condition of our customers  declines  our credit risks could
increase

     in 2002 certain of our customers  experienced  financial  difficulties and
several  filed  with  the  courts  seeking   protection   under   bankruptcy  or
reorganization  laws  we have  experienced  and in the future may  experience
losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable  as well
as the loss of such customers  ongoing business  if our customers fail to meet
their  payment  obligations  to us we could  experience  reduced cash flows and
losses in excess of amounts  reserved  as of december  31  2002  reserves for
trade receivables totaled approximately 59 million

item 2  properties


corning operates more than 70 manufacturing plants and processing facilities of
which  approximately  half  are  located  in the  united  states  corning  owns
substantially all of its executive and corporate buildings which are located in
corning  ny  corning  also owns  substantially  all of its  manufacturing  and
research  and  development  facilities  and  more  than  half of its  sales  and
administrative facilities

during the last five  years  corning has  invested  52  billion in  property
construction  expansion  and modernization for continuing  operations  of the
316  million  spent in 2002  83 million was spent on  facilities  outside the
united states  due to the downturn in the  telecommunications  industry many of
the facilities and  expansions  were not completed  have been abandoned or were
writtenoff see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements

manufacturing sales and administrative and research and development facilities

contingencies  guarantees and hedging activities to the consolidated financial
statements

during 2002  corning  continued the  restructuring  program that closed several
manufacturing  facilities and consolidated  certain smaller  facilities  in the
opinion of  management  cornings  facilities are now suitable and adequate for
production and  distribution  of the companys  products based upon the level of
demand we anticipate in 2003 at december 31 2002 and throughout 2003 corning
expects to have excess  capacity  and will not utilize a portion of space in the
facilities  listed  above  the  largest  unused  portion is our  optical  fiber
manufacturing  facility in  concord  nc which has been  mothballed  until fiber
demand rebounds  management  believes that the concord facility can be returned
to  productive  capacity  within six to nine  months of a decision  to do so and
construction in progress at the concord facility can be completed efficiently



item 3  legal proceedings


environmental litigation corning has been named by the environmental protection
agency under the  superfund  act or by state  governments  under  similar state
laws as a potentially  responsible  party at 12 active  hazardous  waste sites
under the  superfund  act all parties who may have  contributed  any waste to a
hazardous  waste site  identified  by such  agency  are jointly and  severally
liable  for the cost of  cleanup  unless  the  agency  agrees  otherwise  it is
cornings  policy to accrue for its  estimated  liability  related to  superfund
sites and other  environmental  liabilities related to property owned by corning
based on expert analysis and continual  monitoring by both internal and external
consultants  corning has accrued  approximately  22 million for its  estimated
liability for  environmental  cleanup and litigation at december 31 2002 based
upon the  information  developed to date  management  believes that the accrued
reserve is a reasonable  estimate of the companys  estimated liability and that
the risk of an additional loss in an amount  materially higher than that accrued
is remote

schwinger and stevens  toxins  lawsuits  in april 2002  corning was named as a
defendant in two actions  schwinger  and  stevens  filed in the united  states
district  court for the eastern  district of new york  which  asserted  various
personal  injury  and  property  damage  claims  against a number  of  corporate
defendants  these claims  allegedly arise from the release of toxic  substances
from a sylvania nuclear materials processing facility near hicksville new york
amended  complaints  naming 205 plaintiffs  and seeking  damages in excess of 3
billion  were served in  september  2002  the sole basis of  liability  against
corning was plaintiffs claim that corning was the successor to sylvaniacorning
nuclear  corporation  a delaware  corporation  formed in 1957 and  dissolved in
1960  management  intends to vigorously  contest all claims against corning for

page

the reason that  corning is not the  successor to  sylvaniacorning  management
will also defend on the grounds that almost all of the wrongful death claims and
personal injury claims are timebarred  at a status conference in december the
court  decided to  administratively  close the schwinger and stevens cases and
ordered  plaintiffs  counsel to bring new amended  complaints with bellwether
plaintiffs  in these actions  known as schwinger ii and astuto the plaintiffs
have not named corning as a defendant  although it appears that  plaintiffs may
proceed only against the other corporate defendants  the original schwinger and
stevens cases remain pending and no order has been entered  dismissing  corning
based upon the information  developed to date and recognizing  that the outcome
of litigation is  uncertain  management  believes that the risk of a materially
adverse verdict is remote

dow corning bankruptcy corning and the dow chemical company each own 50 of the
common  stock of dow  corning  corporation  which  has  been in  reorganization
proceedings  under  chapter 11 of the united states  bankruptcy  code since may
1995 dow corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed
liabilities arising from breastimplant  product lawsuits  on november 8 1998
dow corning and the tort  claimants  committee  jointly  filed a revised plan of
reorganization   joint  plan  which  provided  for  the  settlement  or  other
resolution of implant claims the joint plan included releases for third parties
including   corning  and  dow  chemical  as   shareholders   in  exchange  for
contributions  to the joint  plan  by an order dated  november  30  1999  the
bankruptcy  court  confirmed  the  joint  plan  but  with  certain  limitations
concerning  the third  party  releases  as  reflected  in an  opinion  issued on
december 21 1999 on november 13 2000 the us district court for the eastern
district of michigan reversed the bankruptcy courts order with respect to these
limitations on the  thirdparty  releases and confirmed the joint plan  certain
foreign  claimants  the us  government  and  certain  other  tort  claimants
appealed from the district courts order on january 29 2002 the us court of
appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed the  determinations  made in the district
court with respect to the foreign claimants  but remanded to the district court
for  further  proceedings  with  respect  to  certain  lien  claims  of the us
government and with respect to the findings  supporting the nondebtor  releases
in favor of dow cornings  shareholders  foreign subsidiaries and insurers the
plan proponents agreed to settle the lien claims of the us government for 98
million to be paid from the settlement  fund under the plan this settlement was
approved by the  district  court in the third  quarter of 2002  on december 11
2002 the district court entered further findings and conclusions supporting the
nondebtor releases certain tort claimants have filed a notice of appeal to the
us  court of appeals for the sixth  circuit from the district  courts  order
management  expects the  appellate  process may take another 12 to 16 months if
the joint  plan with  shareholder  releases  is upheld  after all  appeals  any
remaining  personal  injury  claims  against  corning in these  matters  will be
channeled to the resolution  procedures  under the joint plan if the joint plan
with shareholder releases is not upheld after all appeals  corning would expect
to defend  any  remaining  claims  against  it and any new  claims on the same
grounds  that led to a series of orders  and  judgments  dismissing  all  claims
against  corning in the  federal  courts and in many state  courts as  described
under the  heading  implant  tort  lawsuits  immediately  hereafter  management
believes that the claims against  corning lack merit and that the breast implant
litigation against corning will be resolved without material impact on cornings
financial statements

under the terms of the joint plan  dow corning would be required to establish a
settlement trust and a litigation facility to provide a means for tort claimants
to settle or litigate  their claims  dow corning  would have the  obligation to
fund the trust and the facility  over a period of up to 16 years  in an amount
up to  approximately  33  billion  subject  to  the  limitations  terms  and
conditions  stated in the joint plan  corning and dow chemical have each agreed
to provide a credit  facility to dow corning of up to 150 million 300 million
in the aggregate subject to the terms and conditions stated in the joint plan
the joint plan also provides for dow corning to make full payment  through cash
and issuance of senior notes to its commercial creditors these creditors claim
approximately  810 million in  principal  plus an  additional  sum for pendency
interest  costs and fees from the  petition  date may 15  1995  through  the
effective  date under the plan when payment is made  the  commercial  creditors
have  contested  the  bankruptcy  courts   disallowance  of  their  claims  for
postpetition  interest at default  rates of interest  and have appealed to the
district court the district court heard oral arguments on this appeal on may 2
2002  and has not ruled  the  amount of  additional  interest  costs and fees
claimed by the commercial  creditors is approximately  100 million pretax more
than dow corning believes it should pay

in 1995  corning fully  reserved its  investment in dow corning upon its filing
for bankruptcy and has not recognized  equity  earnings since the second quarter
of 1995 corning has determined that this decline in the value of its investment
in dow corning is other than temporary management has assessed the december 11
2002  findings  by judge  hood and  concluded  that  emergence  of dow  corning
corporation  from  bankruptcy  protection  is  probable   management  has  also
concluded that it has adequately  provided for the other than temporary  decline
associated with the bankruptcy  with the exception of the remote possibility of
a future bankruptcy related charge corning considers the difference between the
carrying  value of its investment in dow corning and its 50 percent share of dow
cornings  equity to be permanent  this  difference is 270 million at december
31 2002

corning will resume recognition of equity earnings from dow corning in the first
quarter of 2003  corning does not expect to receive  dividends from dow corning
in 2003

implant tort lawsuits corning and dow chemical the shareholders of dow corning
corporation  were named in a number of state and federal tort lawsuits alleging
injuries  arising from dow cornings  implant  products  the claims against the
shareholders  alleged a variety of direct or indirect theories of liability  in
1992 the federal breast implants cases were  coordinated for pretrial  purposes
in the united states district court  northern district of alabama judge sam c
pointer  jr  in april 1995  the district  court  granted  corning a summary
judgment  dismissing it from over 4000 federal court cases  on march 12 1996
the us  court of appeals for the eleventh  circuit  dismissed the  plaintiffs
appeal  from that  judgment  in state  court  litigation  corning  was awarded
summary  judgment  in  california  connecticut  illinois  indiana  michigan
mississippi  new jersey new york pennsylvania  tennessee and dallas harris
and travis  counties  in texas  thereby  dismissing  approximately  7000 state
cases in louisiana  cornings  summary judgment was vacated by an intermediate
appeals court in louisiana as premature the louisiana cases were transferred to
the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan  southern
division  michigan  federal  court to which  substantially  all breast implant
cases were transferred in 1997 in the michigan federal court  corning is named
as a defendant in  approximately  70 pending  cases  including  some cases with
multiple  claimants  in  addition  to the  transferred  louisiana  cases  the
michigan  federal court heard cornings  motion for summary judgment on february
27 1998 but has not ruled  based upon the  information  developed to date and
recognizing  that the outcome of complex  litigation  is  uncertain  management
believes that the risk of a materially  adverse result in the implant litigation
against  corning is remote and believes the implant  litigation  against corning
will be resolved without material impact on cornings financial statements

federal securities cases a federal securities class action lawsuit was filed in
1992 against corning and certain individual  defendants by a class of purchasers
of corning stock who allege  misrepresentations  and omissions of material facts
relative to the silicone gel breast implant  business  conducted by dow corning
this  action is pending in the united  states  district  court for the  southern
district of new york the class consists of those purchasers of corning stock in
the period from june 14 1989 to january 13 1992  who allegedly  purchased at
inflated   prices  due  to  the   nondisclosure   or  concealment  of  material
information  no amount of damages is specified in the  complaint  in 1997 the
court  dismissed the  individual  defendants  from the case  in december  1998
corning filed a motion for summary  judgment  requesting that all claims against
it be dismissed plaintiffs requested the opportunity to take depositions before
responding  to the  motion  for  summary  judgment  the  discovery  process  is
continuing  and the court  has set no  schedule  to  address  the still  pending
summary  judgment  motion  corning  intends to  continue  to defend this action
vigorously  based upon the information  developed to date and recognizing  that
the outcome of litigation is uncertain  management believes that the likelihood
of a materially adverse verdict is remote

from  december  2001 through  april 2002  corning and three of its officers and
directors  were named  defendants  in lawsuits  alleging  violations of the us
securities  laws in  connection  with  cornings  november  2000  offering of 30
million  shares  of  common  stock  and 27  billion  zero  coupon  convertible
debentures  due  november  2015  in  addition  the company and the same three
officers and directors were named in lawsuits alleging selective disclosures and
nondisclosures  that allegedly  inflated the price of cornings common stock in
the period from  september  2000 through july 9 2001  the  plaintiffs in these
actions seek to represent  classes of  purchasers  of cornings  stock in all or
part of the period  indicated  these  lawsuits are pending in the united states
district  court for the  western  district of new york  on august 2 2002  the
district  court entered an order  consolidating  these actions for all purposes
designating lead plaintiffs and lead counsel  and directing that a consolidated
complaint be served within sixty days the  consolidated  amended  complaint was
served at the end of october  2002 the defendants have until february 10 2003
to answer  move or respond  the order  further  sets a schedule for briefing a
motion to dismiss  and  provides  that a motion to certify the action as a class
action shall be filed after all motions to dismiss are resolved another lawsuit
has  been  filed  also in the  western  district  of new  york  on  behalf  of
participants  in  the  companys   investment   plan  for  salaried   employees
purportedly  as a class  action  on  behalf  of  participants  in the  plan  who
purchased or held corning stock in a plan account the defendants in that action
responded  with a motion to dismiss  the  lawsuit on a variety  of  grounds  on
december 12 2002 the court entered  judgment  dismissing the claims as to each
of the defendants  on december 19 2002  plaintiffs filed a motion to open the
judgment  and for  leave  to file an  amended  complaint  this  motion  will be
scheduled for a hearing in march  2003  management is prepared to defend these
lawsuits  vigorously  and   recognizing  that  the  outcome  of  litigation  is
uncertain  believes that these will be resolved  net of applicable  insurance
without material impact on cornings financial statements

pittsburgh corning corporation  corning and ppg industries inc ppg each own
50 of the  capital  stock of  pittsburgh  corning  corporation  pcc  pcc and
several other defendants including ppg and corning have been named in numerous
lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos on
april 16 2000  pcc filed for chapter 11  reorganization  in the united  states
bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania  as of the bankruptcy
filing  pcc had in  excess  of  140000  open  claims  and now has in excess of
240000 open claims

in the  bankruptcy  court  pcc in april 2000 obtained a preliminary  injunction
against the  prosecution of asbestos  actions  against its two  shareholders  to
afford  the  parties  a  period  of time  the  injunction  period  in which to
negotiate a plan of reorganization for pcc

on may 14 2002  ppg announced  that it had agreed with several other  parties
including certain of its insurance  carriers and  representatives of current and
future asbestos claimants  on the terms of a settlement arrangement relating to
asbestos claims against ppg and pcc this settlement  would be incorporated in a
plan of reorganization  for pcc and would be subject to a favorable vote by 75
of the asbestos claimants voting on the pcc reorganization plan and approval by
the  bankruptcy   court   according  to  its   announcement   ppg  would  make
contributions to a trust under the reorganization plan consisting of
    cash payments by ppgs  participating  insurance  carriers of approximately
     17 billion over a 21 year period
    the  assignment  of rights to  certain  proceeds  of  policies  by  certain
     insurance carriers not participating in the settlement
    ppgs shares in pcc and pittsburgh corning europe a belgian corporation
    1388889  shares of ppgs common  stock  and
    cash payments from ppg of approximately 998 million over 21 years

page

ppg announced on july 18 2002  that it recorded a charge in its second quarter
results of 495 million aftertax related to this settlement

the injunction period as to corning was extended through september 30 2002 and
later for a period from  december  23 2002 through  january 23  2003  when it
expired by its terms under the terms of the bankruptcy  courts order  corning
has 90 days from the  expiration  of the  injunction  period to seek removal and
transfer of pending  cases in which it is named as a defendant  at the time pcc
filed for bankruptcy protection  there were approximately 12400 claims pending
against  corning  alleging  various  theories of liability  based on exposure to
pccs asbestos  products  although the outcome of litigation and the bankruptcy
case is uncertain management believes that the separate corporate status of pcc
will  continue to be upheld and that  corning has strong  legal  defenses to any
claims of direct liability arising from pccs asbestos products

after ppg announced its settlement  negotiations between representatives of the
asbestos  claimants and corning became more intensive  these  negotiations have
failed to produce a settlement  but  discussions  continue  intermittently  in
cornings  negotiations with the asbestos  claimants  the range of negotiations
has been framed by demands  translating into  approximately 400 million to 500
million in net present value  inclusive of insurance  which is  significantly
lower than that reflected in the ppg settlement  these  negotiations  have been
difficult  and no assurances  can be offered that a settlement can be concluded
within this range

based on negotiations to date management believes that a settlement if one can
be reached would probably include some  combination of the following  elements
cash  payments  by corning  over time into a trust  contribution  of  cornings
shares in pcc and pittsburgh  corning  europe and common shares of corning  and
insurance  through cash payments or  assignments  of certain rights to insurance
proceeds  however  the  structure  of a  settlement  has not been  agreed  and
management can not estimate the likelihood  that any settlement will emerge from
negotiations with the claimants or cornings  insurers  or the probability that
corning will be able to secure a release  through  pccs plan of  reorganization
upon terms and conditions satisfactory to corning

at this time  it appears more likely than not that  corning  will  litigate the
asbestos cases but will continue to explore a settlement through the bankruptcy
process  the exposure for this asbestos litigation net of insurance cannot be
estimated at this time due to the wide range of potential  outcomes  corning is
also currently named in approximately 11400 other cases  approximately  34000
claims  alleging  injuries  from  asbestos  those  cases have been  covered by
insurance  without  material impact to corning to date  asbestos  litigation is
inherently difficult and the outcome of litigation is uncertain and past trends
may not be indicators of future outcomes

as a result of pccs bankruptcy filing  corning recorded an aftertax charge of
36 million in the first quarter of 2000 to impair its entire  investment in pcc
and discontinued  recognition of equity earnings  at december 31 2002 corning
has not  recorded any  additional  charges  associated  with the outcome of this
litigation  as noted above management believes there are strong legal defenses
to the claims against corning  management estimates that the insurance coverage
available to corning related to these matters exceeds 600 million and depending
on the outcome of potential  coverage  issues may exceed 1 billion  management
estimates  that  the  low end of the  range  of loss  resulting  from  continued
litigation is not material  due to the inherent uncertainty of asbestos related
litigation  management  is unable to estimate  the maximum  exposure  from this
litigation

alternatively  in the event that  corning  and its  insurers  agree to a global
settlement of the  pccrelated  cases through the pcc  bankruptcy  process  the
outcome may be material  to the  results of  operations  for the period in which
such costs if any are recognized management expects that any aftertax charge
resulting from cornings  contributions  as part of a possible  settlement could
approximate  125  million to 175  million  and will  depend upon the timing of
contributions  and  relative  participation  of insurance  carriers  management
cannot provide  assurances  that the ultimate  outcome of a settlement  would be
within this range

under either  alternative  management  believes  these matters will be resolved
without material impact to cornings overall financial position or its liquidity

astrium in december of 2000 astrium  sas and astrium  ltd filed a complaint
for negligence in the united states  district court for the central  district of
california against trw inc pilkington optronics inc corning netoptix inc
ofc corporation  and optical filter  corporation  claiming  damages in excess of
150 million  the complaint alleges that certain cover glasses for solar arrays
used to generate  electricity  from solar energy on satellites sold by astriums
corporate  successor  were  negligently  coated by netoptix or its  subsidiaries
prior to  cornings  acquisition  of netoptix in such a way that the amount of
electricity  the satellite can produce and their  effective life were materially
reduced  netoptix  has denied  that the  coatings  produced  by netoptix or its
subsidiaries  caused the damage alleged in the complaint  or that it is legally
liable for any damages  which  astrium may have  experienced  formal  discovery
through document production and depositions was completed for fact witnesses and
will continue through january 2003 for experts in april 2002 the court granted

motions for summary  judgment by netoptix  and other  defendants  to dismiss the
negligence  claims  but  permitted   plaintiffs  to  add  fraud  and  negligent
misrepresentation  claims  against all defendants and a breach of warranty claim
against netoptix and its  subsidiaries  in october 2002 the court again granted
defendants   motions  for  summary   judgment  and   dismissed   the  negligent
misrepresentation  and breach of warranty claims  the only claims remaining are
claims by plaintiff for intentional fraud against all defendants based upon the
current case  management  order  a trial has been scheduled for april 15 2003
based upon the information developed to date and recognizing that the outcome of
litigation is uncertain  management  believes that there are strong defenses to
these  claims and  believes  they will be resolved  without  material  impact on
cornings financial statements

in november 2002  american  motorists  insurance  company and lumbermens mutual
casualty  company  collectively  aimco filed a declaratory  judgment  action
against corning as well as corning netoptix  inc ofc corporation and optical
filter  corporation  in the  complaint  aimco  seeks a ruling that its duty to
defend the insureds in the  underlying  astrium action ceased with the dismissal
of the negligence  claims  aimco also seeks  reimbursement  of approximately 4
million dollars spent for defense costs through november 2002  corning believes
that aimco remains responsible for the continued  representation of all insureds
and for any amount  spent on the defense of the  insureds to date  answers were
filed in january 2003 on behalf of the  defendants  other than corning  corning
has moved to dismiss  all claims  filed  against it as it was not a party to the
underlying  astrium  action  based upon the  information  developed to date and
recognizing  that the outcome of litigation is  uncertain  management  believes
that there are strong defenses to the reimbursement claim for 4 million

contracts the arbitration panel has been convened and the arbitration hearings
are scheduled for late march 2003 based upon the information  developed to date

believes that the risk of a materially adverse verdict is remote

astartetellium in july of 2002 corning filed a demand for binding arbitration

and  tellium  astartes  successor  cornings  demand  includes  a  claim  for
approximately 38 million from those parties due to material  misrepresentations
and fraud as well as a claim to have the contract canceled for breach  afn has
counterclaimed in the arbitration asking the arbitrators to decide that corning
remains obligated under the contract for future contingent payments to afn of up
to 50 million while the outcome of arbitration  proceedings concerning complex
contracts  involving  intellectual  property  matters  cannot be predicted  with
certainty  based upon the information  discovered to date  management believes
that cornings claims are well founded  management expects that the disputes in
arbitration  will be resolved  without  material  negative  impact on  cornings

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results

of operations


the financial  data related to the precision lens business which was sold in the
fourth  quarter of 2002 is reported as  discontinued  operations for all periods
presented  see note 2 to the consolidated  financial  statements and results of
discontinued operations below

overview

during 2002 corning continued the restructuring efforts that began in the second
quarter of 2001 the  telecommunications  industry continued to decline over the
course of the year as the trends  exhibited  in 2001 such as softness in demand
excess  capacity  increased  intensity of competition  and growing  pressure on
price and profits have persisted  major carriers have reduced capital  spending
for  a  variety  of  reasons  some  of  which  include  network  overcapacity
bankruptcy  of key  telecommunications  customers  and suppliers and the overall
economic  uncertainties  in the world economy  the significant  lack of capital
spending by these  carriers  resulted in  drastically  reduced sales volumes for
corning in 2002 as a result  corning  continued to see revenues decline in its
telecommunications segment and thus incurred significant losses again in 2002

these current business  conditions caused corning to revise future  expectations
for its  telecommunications  segment which  resulted in the  recognition  of the
following fourth quarter charges in 2002

    a pretax  charge of 400  million  294  million  aftertax  to impair a
     portion of the goodwill in its telecommunications segment and
    a  pretax  charge  of 269  million  195  million  aftertax  to impair
     tangible and intangible assets in its photonic technologies business

in addition corning recorded the following fourth quarter charges in 2002

    a pretax  charge of 140  million  44  million  aftertax  and  minority
     interest to impair tangible assets in its  conventional  video  components
     business due to the  maturation of the  conventional  television  market in
     north america and
    a pretax charge of 652 million 516 million aftertax for restructuring
     actions  primarily  in the  telecommunications  segment  that  resulted in
     recording a total of 13 billion of restructuring  and impairment  charges
     for the full year

corning took the  following  actions to  compensate  for a decrease in cash from
operations and preserve liquidity

    in december 2002 corning completed the sale of its precision lens business
     for  approximately  850 million and recorded a gain of 652 million  415
     million aftertax
    in july 2002  corning  issued 575 million shares of 7 series c mandatory
     convertible  preferred  stock which  generated net proceeds of 440 million
     and declared a onetime dividend of 117 million on the offering and
    from  time to  time  throughout  the  year  corning  retired  zero  coupon
     convertible  debentures  with an accreted value of 493 million for cash of
     308  million  and  recorded  total  gains of 176  million  108  million
     aftertax  corning  also  spent a total  of 490  million  to  repay  its
     commercial paper borrowings and a portion of other longterm debt

net sales

consolidated  net sales for 2002 were 32  billion  a decrease of 48 or 29
billion  from 2001 sales of 61 billion the sales decline was most pronounced
in the  telecommunications  segment where  significantly  lower demand and price
declines  for  cornings  optical  fiber  and cable  and  photonic  technologies
products  drove a sales  decline in that segment of 63 or 28 billion year to
year sales in the  technologies  segment for 2002 decreased 4 or 55 million
compared to 2001 consolidated net sales for 2001 decreased 13 or 873 million
from 2000 net  sales of 69  billion  excluding  the  impact of  acquisitions
cornings  consolidated  sales in 2001  decreased 17  compared to 2000  sales
declines for 2001 occurred in both operating segments  but were most pronounced
in the telecommunications segment where sales fell 14

gross margin

as a percentage of net sales  gross margin  decreased  from 30 to 19 in 2002
gross  margin   continued  to  be  impacted  by  lower  sales   volumes  in  the
telecommunications  segment where the lower volumes were  insufficient  to cover
the fixed  manufacturing  costs  downward  pricing  pressure also  continued to
negatively  impact  gross  margins  primarily  in the  optical  fiber and cable
business these negative trends were offset by significant fixed cost reductions
as  manufacturing  capacity  was shut  down  gross  margin in the  technologies
segment  decreased  approximately  2 points  from 2001  in 2001  gross  margin
decreased to 30 from 42 in 2000 the decrease was primarily due to the loss of
sales volume in premium fiber and photonics products and a total of 333 million
of charges for the writedown of inventory in the photonic technologies business
over the second and fourth quarters of 2001

selling general and administrative expenses

selling  general  and  administrative  sga  expenses  decreased  34 to 716
million in 2002 while sga  increased 5 points as a  percentage  of net sales to
23 over 2001  the  decrease in sga for the year  reflected  the cost  savings
which  resulted from the  restructuring  actions which began in 2001  while the
increase  as a  percentage  of net  sales  indicated  the  decline  in  revenues
continued  to outpace  the cost  benefit of  restructuring  actions  management
expects  sga as a  percentage  of sales to  decline in 2003 as a result of 2002
restructuring  actions  sga increased 5 in 2001 over 2000 to 1090  million
while sga as a percentage of net sales also  increased 3 points over 2000  the
increase was  primarily  due to a 90 million  charge  related to the release of
restrictions  on shares of  corning  common  stock held by  employees  partially
offset by the benefits of cost reduction activities  the compensation committee
removed the restrictions on approximately 48 million shares  primarily because
they were no longer  effective as a retention tool due to the sharp reduction in
share price from their grant date

research development and engineering

research  development and engineering  expenses rde totaled 483 million for
2002 which  represented a decline of 22  compared to 2001 as a percentage of
net sales  rde  increased 5 points from 2001  the decrease in expense for the
year reflected the impact of the restructuring  actions while the increase as a
percentage  of net  sales was  caused by the  decline  in  revenues  management
expects to  continue to invest in rde in 2003  but expects  rde to decline to
10 of sales in 2001 rde increased 17 to 622 million from 2000  while rde
as a  percentage  of net sales  increased 2 points over 2000  the increase as a
percentage  of sales was due to higher  spending  and  lower  revenues  in 2001
compared to 2000

amortization of goodwill

effective  january 1 2002  corning adopted  statement of financial  accounting
standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets which eliminated
the  amortization of goodwill  the new standard is discussed  further under new
accounting  standards  and  note 1 to  the  consolidated  financial  statements
amortization of goodwill totaled 363 million 344 million  aftertax in 2001
compared to 216 million  202  million  aftertax  in 2000  amortization  of
goodwill increased in 2001 as it included charges for the entire year related to
transactions completed late in 2000 the amortization of goodwill was reduced by
the impairment of goodwill charge taken in the second quarter of 2001

operating loss income

corning incurred a significant  operating loss of 27 billion in 2002 the loss
was primarily due to  restructuring  charges and goodwill and asset  impairments
totaling  21  billion  further  discussion  of  these  charges  begins  under
restructuring  impairment  and other  charges  the 2001 operating loss of 60
billion is largely  attributable to a charge of approximately 48 billion 47
billion  aftertax in the second  quarter to impair  goodwill and certain other
intangible assets of the photonic technologies  business  cornings results for
2001 were also  impacted by charges for  restructuring  actions of 953 million
which included  charges for headcount  reductions  exit costs and impairment of
plant and equipment  an operating  charge of 333 million to writedown  excess
and  obsolete  inventory  a 90  million  charge  related  to  the  release  of
restrictions  on shares of  corning  common  stock and a 28  million  charge to
writedown an investment in intellectual property

cornings 2000 results included  purchased  inprocess  research and development

equity earnings

equity earnings in 2002 were 116 million and declined 22 from 2001  primarily
due to the impairment of an equity  investment in the second quarter of 2002 for
14  million  and a 20  million  reduction  in equity  earnings  in the  fourth
quarter  primarily due to  restructuring  and  impairment  charges  recorded by
samsung   corning  micro  optics   excluding   these  items   equity  earnings
approximated  those in 2001  as a  percentage  of net  sales  equity  earnings
increased 2 points  over 2001  primarily  due to the  decline in sales  equity
earnings in 2001 were 148 million and relatively  flat  compared to 2000 as a
percentage of net sales  equity earnings were also relatively flat compared to
2000

in the  first  quarter  of 2000  corning  discontinued  recognition  of  equity
earnings  from  pittsburgh  corning  corporation  pcc and recorded a charge to

results of discontinued operations

precision lens business

on december 13 2002 corning completed the sale of its cincinnati oh precision
lens business to 3m company  3m  this business  manufactures  precision  lens
assemblies  for  projection  video  systems  corning  sold the  precision  lens
business  for cash  proceeds up to 850  million  of which 50 million has been
deposited in an escrow account  a portion of the escrow account balance will be
used to pay state  income  taxes  relating  to the  transaction  the  remaining
balance plus accrued interest will be paid to corning in december 2003  subject
to any amounts due to 3m relating to certain  indemnifications  made by corning
the  transaction  price is also subject to adjustment  due to changes in working
capital between signing and closing

in 2002  proceeds  from the sale of  precision  lens  were  approximately  800
million in cash  the gain on the sale was 415 million  net of tax  which has
been  recorded  in  income  from  discontinued  operations  in the  consolidated
statements of operations  in 2003  corning could record an additional  gain on
the sale of up to 25 million  net of tax this amount is conditional  upon the
ultimate  amount paid to corning from the escrow account  management  currently
expects to  receive  additional  proceeds  of 10  million  from 3m in the first
quarter  of 2003  and 40  million  in the  fourth  quarter  of  2003  which is
currently held in escrow

the precision  lens business is accounted  for as a  discontinued  operation and
therefore  the  results of  operations  and cash flows have been  removed  from
cornings  results of  continuing  operations  for all  periods  presented  the
precision  lens  business  was  part of  cornings  former  information  display
segment  the results of operations  for the  precision  lens business have been
excluded from the operating segments data

sales  from  discontinued  operations  increased  19  or 43  million in 2002
compared to 2001  the increase was  primarily  due to continued  strong  volume
growth for digital  projection  televisions  particularly  in north america and
asia driven by demand for larger size televisions in the  entertainment  market
sector  excluding the gain on sale  earnings for the business  increased  more
than 85 over  2001 to 63  million  as sales  volume  gains  and  manufacturing
efficiencies from new capacity were realized


page



sales  from  discontinued  operations  increased  9  or 18  million  in 2001
compared  to 2000  the  increase  was due to the growth of  digital  projection
televisions  in the us  and in china  where  the  demand  for high  definition
television  was  growing  despite  the  increase  in sales  earnings  for 2001
decreased approximately 26 to 34 million primarily due to manufacturing costs
related to capacity expansion of projection television assemblies

distribution of shares of quest diagnostics and covance inc

on  december  31  1996   corning   distributed  shares  of  quest  diagnostics
incorporated and covance inc  which  collectively  comprised  cornings health
care  services   segment   to  its  shareholders  on  a  pro  rata  basis  the
distributions  corning agreed to indemnify  quest  diagnostics on an aftertax
basis for the settlement of certain  government claims and against certain other
claims  that  were   pending  at  december  31   1996   coincident   with  the
distributions  corning recorded a payable to quest diagnostics of approximately
25 million which was managements best estimate of amounts which were probable
of  being  paid by  corning  to  quest  diagnostics  to  satisfy  the  remaining
indemnified  claims  on  an  aftertax  basis   quest  diagnostics   settled  a
significant matter with the department of justice late in 2000 requiring corning
to reimburse quest diagnostics 9 million as a result in the fourth quarter of
2000 corning released  reserves  totaling 13 million aftertax in excess of the
indemnified settlement between quest diagnostics and the department of justice

outlook

corning expects 2003 net sales to approximate 2002  reflecting a year over year
decline in the telecommunications segment and an improvement in the technologies
segment  corning also expects at a minimum to significantly  reduce operating
losses in 2003  versus 2002 as a result of  restructuring  actions in the second
half  of  2002 in  telecommunications  and an  expected  strong  performance  in
technologies  cornings  goal is to  return  to  profitability  in 2003  before
consideration  of  restructuring  or other onetime  charges  cornings goal to
return  to  profitability  is  dependent  upon  stabilization  of  revenues  and
continued strength in north america and world economies

corning will begin recognizing  equity earnings from dow corning  corporation in
the first quarter of 2003 corning does not expect to receive any dividends from
dow corning in 2003

for the  first  quarter  of 2003  corning  expects  sales in the  range of 700
million to 730  million  corning  expects a net loss in the range of 001 per
share to 004 per share  excluding gains on debt repurchases and restructuring
charges in the  quarter  this loss is net of  expected  equity  earnings in the
range of 10 million to 20 million from dow corning

management  continues to believe  corning has  sufficient  liquidity to meet its
funding needs for 2003 and beyond  corning  finished the year with 21 billion
in cash and shortterm investments and full access to an unused revolving credit
facility of 20  billion  capital  spending is  expected to  approximate  350
million to 450 million in 2003 the  anticipated  spending will focus primarily
on the  planned  expansion  in the  liquid  crystal  display  and  environmental
businesses

impairment of goodwill

2002 charge

as  discussed  in new  accounting  standards  and  note  1 to  the  consolidated
financial  statements  in january  2002  corning  adopted sfas no 142  which
requires  companies to stop amortizing  goodwill and certain  intangible  assets
with an indefinite useful life instead  sfas no 142 requires that goodwill be
reviewed  for  impairment  upon  adoption of sfas no 142  january 1 2002 and
annually  thereafter  corning  performed an initial  benchmark  assessment upon
adoption at january 1 2002  and  determined  that a transition  charge was not
required  corning  chose the fourth  quarter to conduct  its annual  impairment
test

under  sfas no  142  goodwill  impairment  occurs  if the net book  value of a
reporting  unit  exceeds its  estimated  fair value  the  majority of cornings
goodwill is included in the telecommunications reporting unit which is the same
as the  telecommunications  segment  the test  completed in the fourth  quarter
indicated  that the recorded book value of this reporting unit exceeded its fair
value as determined by discounted cash flows

management  believes the  telecommunication  industry is currently depressed but
will  ultimately  recover  management does not expect growth in this segment in
the  shortterm  but believes  that growth will return to this segment by 2005
cornings  view  that the  industry  will  recover  is  based  on the fact  that
bandwidth demand continues to grow currently  and the belief that a combination
of public policy changes  consolidation and recovery of industry  players  and
the advancement of profitable  broadband  business models will drive recovery in
the  future  the  decrease in fair value from that  measured  in the  benchmark
assessment primarily reflects

    a delay in the timing of the  expected  recovery  from late 2002  or early
     2003 to 2005
    a reduction in the shortterm cash flow expectations of the fiber and cable
     business and a lower base from which the expected recovery will occur and
    a  reduction  in the short and  longterm  cash  flow  expectations  of the
     photonic technologies business

management  retained  valuation  specialists  to assist in the  valuation of its
tangible and  identifiable  intangible  assets for purposes of  determining  the
implied  fair value of goodwill at december  31 2002  upon  completion  of the
annual assessment corning recorded a noncash impairment charge of 400 million
294  million  aftertax  to reduce  the  carrying  value of  goodwill  in the
telecommunications reporting unit to its estimated fair value of 16 billion

management cannot provide  assurance that future impairment  charges will not be
required if the  telecommunications  industry  does not recover as  projected by
management in its expected future cash flow estimates  management must exercise
judgment in assessing the  recoverability of goodwill  see critical  accounting
estimates for related discussion

2001 charge

during the first half of 2001 corning experienced a significant decrease in the
rate of growth of its  telecommunications  segment  primarily  in the  photonic
technologies business  due to a dramatic decline in infrastructure  spending in
the telecommunications  industry  during the second quarter major customers in
the photonic  technologies  business  reduced their order forecasts and canceled
orders  already  placed  as a result  management  determined  that the  growth
prospects of this business were significantly less than previously  expected and
those of historical periods

corning reviews the recoverability of its longlived assets  including goodwill
and other intangible assets  when events or changes in circumstances occur that
indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable  as a result of
the business  conditions noted above  corning  concluded such an assessment was
required for its photonic technologies  business in the second quarter  corning
assesses  recoverability  of the carrying value based upon  cumulative  expected
future pretax cash flows  undiscounted  and without  interest  charges of the
related operations

as a  result  of this  test  corning  determined  that the  longlived  assets
including  goodwill  and other  intangibles  related to the  acquisition  of the
pirelli  optical  components and devices  business the pirelli  transaction in
december  2000  as well as those of the unit into  which  netoptix  corporation
acquired in may 2000 had been integrated  were not recoverable under sfas no
121  accounting  for the  impairment of longlived  assets and for  longlived
assets to be  disposed  of which was the  governing  us  generally  accepted
accounting principle gaap guidance at that time the impairment assessment was
performed  at these  levels as  discrete  cash  flows were  available  for these
divisions  within the photonic  technologies  business  cornings  policy is to
writedown longlived assets to fair value in such circumstances

management  estimated  fair value using  several  techniques  while each method
generated  comparable fair values  management  adjusted the assets to estimates
based on average  multiples of  forecasted  revenues and earnings of  comparable
publicly  traded  companies  with  operations  in the optical  component  market
segment  this  valuation  method is  consistent  with that used in the original
valuation of the  acquisitions  of net optix and certain assets from the pirelli
transaction  the fair value of these  assets were lower in june 2001 from their
acquisition  dates as market  multiples  had  changed  from those  reflected  in
transactions consummated in 2000

in the  second  quarter  of 2001  corning  recorded  pretax  charges of 4648
million to impair a  significant  portion of goodwill and 116 million to impair
other intangible assets of the total goodwill charge of 4648 million  3038
million  related  to the  pirelli  transaction  and  1610  million  related to
goodwill resulting from the acquisition of netoptix corporation

in the  second  quarter of 2001  it was  determined  that there were  events of
impairment within portions of the photonic technologies business the accounting
literature effective at that time sfas no 121 required that intangible assets
be assessed for recoverability at the lowest level for which discrete cash flows
can be measured as a result of this analysis corning recorded a charge of 116
million to impair a portion of the patents acquired in the pirelli  transaction
the valuation methods from which this results are described above

restructuring actions

2002 restructuring actions

the continued  decline in demand in the  telecommunications  segment during 2002
required   additional   restructuring   beyond  that  taken  in  2001  to  bring
manufacturing  capacity in line with  revenue  projections  corning  recorded a
total of 13  billion  in pretax  charges  over the  second  third and fourth
quarters actions approved and initiated in 2002 included the following

    permanent  closing of cornings optical fiber  manufacturing  facilities in
     noble park victoria  australia and neustadt bei coburg germany corning
     also mothballed its optical fiber manufacturing facility in concord nc and
     transferred certain capabilities to its wilmington nc facility
    reductions in capacity and employment in cornings cabling and hardware and
     equipment locations worldwide to reduce costs
    permanent   closure  of  its   photonic   technologies   thin  film  filter
     manufacturing facility in marlborough ma
    permanent  abandonment  of  certain  construction  projects  that  had been
     stopped   in  2001  in  the   fiber   and   cable   business   within   the
     telecommunications segment
    closure   of   minor   manufacturing    facilities    primarily   in   the
     telecommunications segment
    closure and consolidation of research facilities
    elimination  of  positions  worldwide  through  voluntary  and  involuntary
     programs and
    divestiture  of a portion of the  controls and  connectors  business in the
     telecommunications segment


page



in addition  corning  impaired  cost based  investments  in a number of private
telecommunications companies based upon a decision in the fourth quarter of 2002
to divest the portfolio

     restructuring charges
     
     the 2002  restructuring  charges of 447 million  included  376 million of
     employee  separation costs including  special  termination and curtailment
     losses  related to pension  and  postretirement  health  care  plans  85
     million in other exit costs  principally  lease  termination  and contract
     cancellation  payments  and a 14  million  credit  related  to  the  2001
     restructuring actions the charge entailed the elimination of approximately
     7100 hourly and salaried positions in the  telecommunications  segment and
     corporate research and administrative staffs organizations  employees have
     been informed of the  restructuring  initiatives and benefits  available to
     them under applicable  benefit plans  these benefits included  involuntary
     separation early retirement and social programs

     impairment of plant and equipment
     
     corning has evaluated the carrying value of the  longlived  assets at each
     site impacted by the  restructuring  actions for  impairment  the carrying
     value of a longlived  asset is considered  impaired  when the  anticipated
     separately  identifiable  undiscounted  cash flows from that asset are less
     than  the  carrying  value  of  the  asset  the  impairment  charges  were
     determined  based on the amount by which the  carrying  value  exceeded the
     fair market value of the asset  corning  recorded  712 million in 2002 to
     impair  plant  and  equipment  related  to  facilities  to be  shutdown  or
     disposed   primarily  in  the  fiber  and  cable  business  the  photonic
     technologies  business  and  certain  research  facilities  the charge was
     partially offset by an 11 million  adjustment to assumed salvage values on
     asset disposals  related to the 2001 restructuring  actions  of the total
     charge  107 million pertained to abandoned  construction  projects in the
     fiber and cable business primarily the latest expansion in concord nc and
     oklahoma city ok

     a significant  portion of the assets  impaired were recently  acquired  or
     built in connection  with capacity  expansions  in  anticipation  of future
     demand  most of the impaired  facilities are currently available for sale
     others will be demolished or abandoned  the remaining  impaired  equipment
     will be auctioned sold disposed of or abandoned during 2003

     loss on divestiture
     
     in the second quarter of 2002  corning completed the sale of its appliance
     controls group which was included in the controls and  connectors  business
     in the telecommunications segment in the second and third quarter of 2002
     corning  received  cash of 24  million  note  proceeds  of 6 million and
     recorded  a loss on the sale of  approximately  16  million  10  million
     aftertax which is included in impairment charges

     impairment of cost investments
     
     during the  second and fourth  quarters  of 2002  corning  recorded  total
     charges of 107 million 66 million  aftertax  for other than  temporary
     declines in certain cost investments in the telecommunications  segment in
     the fourth quarter  corning  decided to divest its remaining  portfolio of
     cost investments in private  telecommunications  related  companies  these
     investments have been written down to their estimated fair value based upon
     information available from prospective purchasers

as of december 31 2002  approximately  5100 of the 7100  employees  had been

be  separated by december 31  2003  the  majority of these  employees  will be
separated by the end of the first quarter of 2003 corning expects approximately
one  third  of the  2002  restructuring  charges  to be  paid  in  cash  if the
restructuring actions are successfully implemented corning expects such actions
to yield  approximately  465 million in annual savings  the savings consist of
lower wage and benefit  costs  avoided  depreciation  and fixed costs on closed
facilities approximately 40 of the savings from the restructuring actions will
be realized in cost of sales with the remainder split between  selling  general
and administrative and research development and engineering expenses

impairment of longlived assets other than goodwill

photonic technologies business

the photonic  technologies  business is a manufacturer  of photonic  modules and
components for the worldwide  telecommunications industry and is reported in the
telecommunications  segment  the  telecommunications  market  is  undergoing  a
dramatic  decline in demand for  telecommunication  products as major  buyers of
network  equipment in this industry have reduced  their capital  spending  plans
over the past two years and are expected to continue such reductions in the near
future  the lack of demand for optical component products started in early 2001
and resulted in  restructuring  and  impairment  charges in 2001 and 2002  this
negative trend is expected to continue into the foreseeable future

as disclosed in cornings third quarter form 10q certain competitors indicated
that they will exit the business and others  announced  decisions to consolidate
or restructure  corning continues to evaluate  strategic  alternatives for this
business  while  certain  product  lines are promising in the event of industry
recovery the pace and extent of that recovery is uncertain  alternatives under
consideration for this business include staying in the business with scaled down
operations  or  contract  manufacturing  partnering  sale or  abandonment  in
february 2003  corning  announced it would close its optical  switching product
line and  record a pretax  charge of 20  million  to 30  million in the first
quarter of 2003 as short term projections  reflect continued operating and cash
losses and the longterm expectations are uncertain  it was determined that the
longlived assets of this business  property  plant and equipment and patents
should be evaluated for impairment

the impairment  evaluation  required  management to develop  operating cash flow
projections  for  each  strategic  alternative  and make  assessments  as to the
probability  of each outcome  it was determined  that the longlived  assets of
this business were not  recoverable  through future cash flows  the assets were
written down to estimated  salvage value  as this amount is the best reflection
of  fair  value  this  resulted  in a 269  million  195  million  aftertax
writedown of the assets  which was reflected in the line item  restructuring
impairment and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations  the
charge included 90 million related to patents the estimate of salvage value is
an area of management  judgement  see critical accounting estimates for related
discussion  the remaining  longterm  assets of this business  approximate  24
million and are classified as held for use

conventional video components business

corning  asahi video  products  company  a 51 owned  consolidated  subsidiary
conventional video components business  is a manufacturer of glass panels and
funnels  for  use  in  conventional  tube  televisions  and is  reported  in the
technologies  segment  for  sfas  no  131  reporting   the  conventional  tube
television  segment  of the market in north  america  is very  mature and highly
competitive   the  market  has  been  impacted  by  a  decline  in  demand  for
conventional  television glass associated with shifting consumer  preference for
flat  panel  and  projection   television  sets  as  well  as  other  competing
technologies  the segment has also been  impacted by dramatic  increases in the
importation  of television  glass  tubes and sets from asia  the  conventional
television tube market is undergoing  intense  competition at this time and as a
result is experiencing tremendous price pressure one major customer has already
exited this market and industry consolidation continues demand from another key
customer  is  uncertain   competition  from  imported  products  has  increased
significantly within the last year while the demand for flat screen televisions
has been  increasing  for several  years  these trends are expected to continue
into the foreseeable future

these market trends combined with cash losses in this business in the shortterm
indicated an evaluation for the  recoverability  of the longlived assets of the
business was required and management  determined  that the longlived  assets of
the business have been impaired  the impairment  evaluation required management
to develop  operating cash flow  projections for each strategic  alternative and
make  assessments as to the probability of each outcome  it was determined that
the long lived assets were not recoverable through future cash flows management
estimated  the fair  value of the  longlived  assets  which  were  limited  to
property  plant and  equipment  using the  expected  cash flow  approach  as a
measure of fair value  this  resulted in a 140 million 44 million  aftertax
and minority interest writedown of the assets which was reflected in the line
item   restructuring   impairment  and  other  charges  in  the  consolidated
statements of operations

the cash flow  realized by this  business  will be impacted by actions  taken by
competitors and customers  should our future  performance differ adversely from
our  projections  corning  could be  required to record  additional  impairment
charges  it is also  possible  that  corning  could choose to exit the business
should  cash  flows be less than  projected  the  remaining  net assets of this
business approximate 77 million

operating segments

corning  previously   grouped  its  products  into  three  operating   segments
telecommunications advanced materials and information display beginning in the
fourth quarter of 2002  cornings reportable segments consist of the following
telecommunications  and technologies  as a result of the fourth quarter sale of
the precision  lens business and the reduced  significance  of the  conventional
video components business management realigned the remainder of the information
display segment with the businesses previously reported in advanced materials to
create the  technologies  segment  the precision lens business is reported as a
discontinued operation and therefore its results have been excluded from segment
reporting and historical periods have been conformed to this presentation also
in the second  quarter of 2002  corning  revised its  definition of segment net
income  prior  to the  second  quarter  corning  disclosed  restructuring  and
impairment  charges and  acquisitionrelated  charges by segment  but  excluded
these from quantitative segment results these charges have now been included in
the  segment  net income and  historical  periods  have been  conformed  to this
presentation this change was made to increase the transparency of the impact of
these  charges  on segment  results  corning  excludes  the  restructuring  and
impairment charges and acquisitionrelated  charges in discussing the results of
each  business  in the  segment to provide  clarity on the  underlying  business
trends corning also includes the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely
associated  with  cornings  operating  segments in segment net income  segment
amounts  exclude  revenues   expenses  and  equity  earnings  not  specifically
identifiable to segments

corning  prepared the financial  results for its  operating  segments on a basis
that is  consistent  with the  manner  in which  corning  management  internally
disaggregates  financial  information  to assist in  making  internal  operating
decisions   corning  has  allocated  certain  common  expenses  among  segments
differently  than it would for  standalone  financial  information  prepared in
accordance  with gaap  these  expenses  include  interest  taxes and corporate
functions  segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other
companies

2002 vs 2001

this segment incurred  significant  restructuring and impairment charges in 2002
and 2001  the 2002 and 2001 charges are  described in detail in  restructuring
impairment and other charges  the  restructuring  activities were undertaken to
reduce the operating cost structure due to continued market declines  more than
half of the 2002 charge is impairment  of fixed  assets  primarily in the fiber
and cable  business  a  significant  portion of the asset  impairments  in this
business represent the closure of two fiber plants and permanent  abandonment of
certain construction projects that had been stopped in 2001 in the optical fiber
and cable  business  the balance of the charge  represents  impairments of cost
based  investments   primarily  in  the  photonic  technologies  business  and
severance and benefits for retirees and separated  personnel in all  businesses
in addition  the segment  incurred a 400 million  charge for the impairment of
goodwill and a 269 million charge for longlived asset  impairments at photonic
technologies  the  impairment  charge  incurred  in the second  quarter of 2001
relates to goodwill and certain acquired  intangible assets from acquisitions in
the photonic technologies business these charges are described in impairment of
goodwill and impairment of other longlived assets

sales in the segment declined 63 or 2827 million from 2001 as each business
in the  segment  experienced  a  significant  decline in volume with the largest
declines in optical  fiber and cable and the photonic  technologies  businesses
the segment  incurred losses of 19 billion in 2002  compared to a net loss of
52  billion  in 2001  the  2002  loss was  primarily  due to the  significant
decrease in sales volume and restructuring and impairment charges each business
also  reported  a  loss  in  2002   the  trend  between  years  reflects  lower
restructuring  and  impairment   charges   excluding  these  restructuring  and
impairment charges  segment net loss was 592 million compared to a loss of 81
million in 2001 the increase in the loss in 2002 reflects reduced sales volumes
and lower  prices in each  business  offset by cost  reductions  resulting  from
restructuring actions

the optical  fiber and cable  business is the largest  business in the  segment
sales in the optical fiber and cable business declined 70 or 2030 million in
2002  the decrease was  primarily  due to a sales volume  decline for fiber and
cable  products  of more  than 50 for the year as well as  double  digit  price
declines  excluding restructuring and impairment charges the optical fiber and
cable business  incurred a significant loss in 2002  compared to profits in the
prior year primarily due to significantly lower sales volume  declining prices
and unfavorable product mix

as discussed in  restructuring  actions  the optical  fiber and cable  business
undertook significant restructuring actions in the fourth quarter these actions
included permanent closure of two international fiber  manufacturing  plants and
the mothballing of the concord  nc facility  in addition  cabling  operations
will continue to be consolidated corning is not exiting any product or business
lines as a result of the decision to reduce capacity  but is adjusting capacity
to most  efficiently  meet expected  demand  levels  through at least the end of
2004  management  believes  that  the  concord  facility  can  be  returned  to
productive  capacity  within  six to  nine  months  of a  decision  to do so and
construction in progress at the concord  facility can be completed  efficiently
management  believes the concord and wilmington  plants will provide  sufficient
capacity for the foreseeable future of this business

sales in the hardware and  equipment  business  decreased  32 or 265 million
compared to 2001 the sales  decreases were primarily due to the overall lack of
spending   impacting   the   entire   telecommunications   industry   excluding
restructuring  charges the business incurred a loss driven by lower volumes and
pricing pressure in 2002 compared to a near breakeven performance in 2001 this
business  also  undertook  restructuring  actions in the fourth  quarter  these
actions included exiting certain product lines  headcount  reductions and asset
abandonments

the photonic technologies business manufactures photonic modules and components
primarily  for  the  optical   amplification   market  sales  in  the  photonic
technologies business declined 80 or 436 million compared to 2001 primarily
due to  lower  sales  volume  as  network  buildouts  in the  telecommunications
industry  declined  resulting in much lower demand for  photonic  products  the
business  incurred  a  significant  loss  for  2002  before   restructuring  and
impairment charges  primarily due to dramatically lower sales volumes however
the 2002 losses  decreased  more than 50  compared  to the losses  incurred in
2001 which included inventory  writedowns of 333 million  the results in 2002
reflect cost reductions  resulting from restructuring  actions taken in 2001 and
2002

during the second quarter of 2002 the business favorably resolved an open issue
from  the  second  quarter  of 2001  with a  major  customer  resulting  in the
recognition  of revenue of 14 million and  pretax  income of 3 million  this
revenue was recognized in part on shipment of inventory previously reserved  in
addition  the business settled an open matter with a significant vendor in 2002
resulting in the  reversal of a vendor  reserve of 20 million that was recorded
as part of the charge in the second quarter of 2001

the lack of demand  for  optical  component  products  started in early 2001 and
resulted in restructuring and impairment charges in 2001 and 2002 this negative
trend is expected to continue into the foreseeable future

as disclosed in cornings third quarter form 10q certain competitors indicated
that they will exit the business and others  announced  decisions to consolidate
or restructure  corning continues to evaluate  strategic  alternatives for this
business  while  certain  product  lines are promising in the event of industry
recovery the pace and extent of that recovery is uncertain  alternatives under
consideration for this business include staying in the business with scaled down
operations  or  contract  manufacturing  partnering  sale or  abandonment  in
february 2003 corning announced it will stop  commercialization  of its optical
switching  product in 2003 and will incur pretax  charges of 20 million to 30
million  related  to the  exit  representing  severance  and  cash  exit  costs
management  estimates  that  severance  and exit  costs  related  to a  complete
abandonment  of remaining  product  lines could  approximate  70 million to 80
million in total pretax charges

the controls and connectors business  manufactures high performance  oscillators
and  crystals  used in  various  telecommunications  applications  sales in the
controls and  connectors  business  decreased  47 or 96 million  compared to
2001  due to the sale of the appliance  controls group in may 2002 and the lack
of capital spending in the telecommunications  industry excluding restructuring
charges  earnings  were also down due to lower  sales  volumes as the  business
incurred  a loss  for the  year  compared  to  earnings  in  2001  the loss on
divestiture of 16 million 10 million aftertax is included in restructuring
impairment and other charges  the business undertook  restructuring  actions in
the fourth quarter that are expected to reduce operating costs in 2003

2001 vs 2000

sales in the telecommunications segment decreased 14 or 728 million from 2000
to 45  billion  excluding the impact of  acquisitions  the sales decline was
19 the decrease in sales was primarily  due to sales volume  decreases in most
businesses throughout the segment as capital spending in the  telecommunications
industry  decreased  significantly   segment  net  income  fell  precipitously
compared to 2000s  strong  results as net income in the optical fiber and cable
business  was more  than  offset  by  losses  in all  other  businesses  and the
significant  restructuring and impairment  charges  the loss of sales volume in
premium  fiber and  photonic  products  reduced  gross  margins  and the segment
incurred  operating  charges  totaling 333 million 221 million  aftertax to
writedown  excess  and  obsolete   inventory   including   estimated  purchase
commitments  further lowering gross margin percentages  segment net income for
2000   was   impacted   by   463   million   442   million    aftertax   of
acquisitionrelated charges primarily iprd see iprd section for more detail

sales in the  optical  fiber and cable  business in 2001  remained  flat at 29
billion compared with 2000 although sales declined significantly in the fourth
quarter  of 2001  excluding  the impact of  acquisitions  sales  declined  4
compared  to 2000  the lack of growth  reflects  the loss of volume in  premium
products  beginning in the second quarter due to the decline in longhaul demand
as capital spending for network  buildouts  diminished and the business began to
experience  volume decreases in sales of singlemode fiber in the third quarter
as a result  most  fiber  manufacturing  facilities  were  idled in the  fourth
quarter  overall  fiber and cable volume decreased  approximately  15 for the
year as a result of an  increase of  approximately  30 in the first half of the
year  offset  by a  decrease  of  approximately  50 in the  second  half  the
weightedaverage  price for cornings  optical fiber and cable products remained
relatively   stable   compared  to  2000  as  higher  prices  were  offset  by
significantly  decreased  volumes  for  premium  products  premium  fiber  as a
percentage of total fiber demand was approximately 20 in 2001

net income for the optical fiber and cable business  decreased over 5 compared
to 2000 as the loss of sales volume in premium products was partially offset by
increased  sales of lower margin  singlemode  products  in response to reduced
demand for fiber  products  corning  announced  it will  permanently  close its
optical fiber operations in deeside  north wales and its cabling  operations in
saskatoon  canada in  addition to  temporarily  ceasing  production  at smaller
cabling facilities

sales in the hardware and  equipment  business  declined 20 or 203 million in
2001  compared to 2000  excluding the impact of  acquisitions  sales declined
28  compared to 2000 the decrease was primarily due to lower sales volumes as
capital spending in the cable television  industry fell significantly from prior
year levels  business  performance  decreased  significantly to a small loss in
2001 primarily due to considerably  lower sales volumes  this business  reduced
its headcount during the year and closed a small manufacturing facility

sales in the  photonic  technologies  business  declined  48 or 503  million
compared to 2000 the sales decrease  reflected  significant  declines in orders
from  major  customers  caused  by  the  decrease  in  capital  spending  in the
telecommunications  industry the business incurred a significant operating loss
for the year largely due to lower sales volumes excess capacity a higher fixed
cost  structure and charges for excess and obsolete  inventory in the second and
fourth quarters


page



during the second quarter major customers in the photonic technologies business
reduced their order forecasts and canceled  orders already placed  as a result
management  determined that certain products were not likely to be sold in their
product life cycle  corning  recorded a charge to writedown excess and obsolete
inventory  including  estimated  purchase  commitments  of 273 million  184
million  aftertax in cost of sales in the second quarter of 2001 the business
recorded an  additional  charge of 60 million  37 million  aftertax  in the
fourth quarter as a result of lower revenue forecasts for 2002

corning  has  or is in the  process of  disposing  all such  inventory  except
approximately  100 million  corning has retained and isolated this  inventory
and in the unlikely event that product is sold  corning will fully disclose the
impact on its margins

corning announced a downsizing of the photonic  technologies business and closed
the following three manufacturing facilities in 2001

    benton park facility in benton township pa
    corning lasertrons facility in nashua nh and
    monroe park manufacturing and development operations in henrietta ny

in addition  corning scaled back its photonic technologies  operations in erwin
park  ny  and  the   remainder  of  its  photonic   facilities  to  adjust  its
manufacturing  capacity levels and headcount to lower revenue expectations  the
business reduced its headcount  approximately 75 from peak employment levels in
2001

sales in the controls and connectors  business  decreased 15 or 36 million in
2001  compared  to 2000  lower  sales  volume was the  primary  reason for the
decline due to the weak us  economy  the business  incurred an  insignificant
loss  for the  year  compared  to an  insignificant  profit  in 2000 due to the
depressed volume

outlook  business conditions in the  telecommunications  segment have been very
difficult  due  to  sharply  reduced  capital  spending  by   telecommunications
companies  management anticipates that these difficult conditions will continue
through  at  least  the end of  2003  while  management  ultimately  expects  a
recovery  it is  difficult  to forecast  when  capital  spending  by  cornings
customers will increase and therefore difficult to predict revenues and earnings
in this segment in the  shortterm  corning  expects sales to deteriorate  200
million to 250 million from 2002 sales  the industry  continues to  experience
significant  excess capacity  resulting in pricing pressure that is expected to
continue  throughout  2003  corning  expects  the  loss  in the  segment  to be
significantly  less  than  2003 due to  significantly  lower  restructuring  and
impairment  charges  the results  will also  reflect  cost savings from actions
undertaken in 2002

technologies

the  technologies   segment   manufactures   specialized  products  with  unique
properties for customer applications  utilizing glass glass ceramic and polymer
technologies its primary products include liquid crystal display glass for flat
panel  displays  ceramic  substrates for  automobile  and diesel  applications
scientific  laboratory  products  glass panels and funnels for  televisions and
cathode ray tubes

2002 vs 2001

sales in the  technologies  segment  during 2002  decreased  4 or 55 million
compared to 2001  as  increased  sales in display  technologies  environmental
technologies  and life  sciences  were  offset by much lower sales in the mature
conventional  video  components  business  decreased  demand for  semiconductor
materials  and the impact of  cornings  exit of its lighting  products  line in
2002  segment  earnings  increased  29 or 27 million  compared to 2001  as
improved  operating  performance in display  technologies  and the life sciences
business and stronger equity earnings were partially offset by restructuring and
impairment  charges and decreased  earnings in the  semiconductor  materials and
conventional video components businesses  the 2002 restructuring costs recorded
in this segment  consisted  entirely of  severance  and benefits for retired and
separated  employees in several  businesses  the impairment  charges related to
assets  held  for  use  in  the  conventional  video  components  business  see
impairment of longlived assets other than goodwill

sales in the display technologies  business the largest business in the segment
and a leading supplier of ultrathin glass substrates used to produce flat panel
display  increased  25 or 82  million  compared to 2001  the  increase was
primarily  due to higher  sales  volume as  penetration  in the  desktop  market
increased  the prior  years  sales were  negatively  impacted by an  inventory
correction  in the industry in the first  quarter of 2001  volume gains of over
46 for the current  year were  partially  offset by price  declines of 10 on a
constant  currency  basis  earnings in the business  increased over 30 for the
year  compared  to 2001  primarily  due to  volume  gains  and a more than 30
improvement in equity earnings from samsung corning precision glass company ltd
samsung  corning  precision  a korean  manufacturer of liquid crystal display
glass  both  corning and  samsung  corning  precision  have  recently  approved
expansions of manufacturing  capacity in taiwan and korea  respectively  these
capital projects are expected to begin production in 2003

sales in the environmental  technologies  business  a manufacturer of catalytic
converter substrates  increased 4 or 15 million compared to 2001 primarily
due to increased us auto production driven by financing  incentives and strong
growth in europe and japan  earnings in this business  improved 8 compared to
2001  as a  significant  increase in equity  earnings  from  cormetech  a us
designer and manufacturer of industrial catalysts was partially offset by price
declines  and  increased  manufacturing  and  development  costs  related to new
products

in october 2001  corning  announced the  construction  of a new diesel emission
control product manufacturing  facility  the new plant is being built in erwin
ny construction on the project began in 2002 and is expected to be completed in
2004

sales in the life  sciences  business  a supplier of advanced  microplates  and
other  laboratory  products  increased  5 or 13  million  compared to 2001
primarily due to strong growth in most product  lines  earnings in the business
more  than  doubled  over  2001   primarily   due  to  cost  savings  from  the
discontinuation of cornings investment in microarray technology products in the
third quarter of 2001 as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies and higher
sales

sales in the conventional video components business a manufacturer of optically
pure mechanically precise face plates and funnels for largerscreen  television
tubes  decreased  34 or 86 million  compared to 2001  pricing  pressure is
strong in this market due to increased  competition  a  significant  portion of
this business is  concentrated  with few  customers  two of which have recently
merged  one significant  customer has exited the business and sales demand from
another key customer is uncertain  management is  considering  operational  and
strategic alternatives should the business continue to decline corning recorded
an impairment of the property plant and equipment of this business recognizing
a charge of 140  million in the  fourth  quarter  of 2002  see  restructuring
impairment and other charges for further detail  excluding the asset impairment
and restructuring charges the loss in the business increased almost 50 for the
year  compared to 2001  primarily due to decreased  sales volume and continued
competitive pricing pressures samsung corning company ltd samsung corning a
50 owned  manufacturer  of glass panels and funnels based in south korea  also
experienced  pricing pressure  resulting in an approximate 10 decline in equity
earnings for 2002 compared to the prior year

sales  in  cornings  other  technologies  businesses  including  semiconductor
materials and ophthalmic  products  decreased 23 or 79 million  compared to
2001 the decrease was led by the exit of the lighting  business and lower sales
volume of high  purity  fused  silica  products in the  semiconductor  materials
business as capital spending in the semiconductor equipment industry remained at
relatively low levels  the businesses  incurred a loss for the year compared to
breakeven results in 2001 the losses were primarily due to significantly lower
sales volume and increased  spending in development  and engineering for calcium
fluoride products

2001 vs 2000

sales  in 2001 for the  technologies  segment  decreased  8  or 140  million
compared to 2000  excluding  the impact of  acquisitions  sales  declined 10
sales increases in the life sciences  business were more than offset by declines
in every other  business in this  segment  segment net income also  declined in
2001 as the segment recorded net income of 92 million compared to 270 million
in 2000 for a 66 decrease  or 178 million  the decline in profitability was
primarily due to restructuring charges and weaker performance by most businesses
in the segment  which was partially offset by improved  performance in the life
sciences business

sales in the display technology  business decreased 3 or 10 million in 2001
compared to 2000  a  significant  shift in customer  demand from japan to korea
caused volume to increase approximately 35 at samsung corning precision and 17
in the consolidated  business  this volume growth when offset by the impact of
price declines and the  deterioration of the yen  resulted in the sales decline
of 3  earnings for 2001 decreased  approximately  25  primarily due to lower
operating margins driven by pricing  pressures  startup costs incurred for the
may opening of a new manufacturing facility in taiwan and additional development
and engineering expenses for eagle2000tm a new glass substrate used in active
matrix  liquid  crystal  displays  additionally  equity  earnings from samsung
corning precision decreased over 15 compared to 2000  primarily due to corning
having a smaller ownership interest in the company in 2001 versus 2000

sales in the environmental  technologies  business decreased 8 or 32 million
in 2001  compared  to 2000  the  business  experienced  lower  sales  volumes
compared to 2000 due to decreased vehicle production volume growth in asia was
more than offset by declining volumes in north america and europe  earnings for
the  year  were  down  almost  50   primarily  due  to  lower  sales  volumes
manufacturing  inefficiencies related to the introduction of new ultra thin wall
products excess capacity and startup costs in south africa and china

sales in the life  sciences  business  increased  8 or 19  million  in 2001
compared to 2000  the  improvement  was  primarily  due to an increase in sales
volume  earnings in the base business excluding microarray  technology almost
doubled over 2000  primarily due to a shift to higher margin  products in sales
mix along with  improvements  in  manufacturing  costs and selling  general and
administrative  expenses  overall  earnings in the business were diluted due to
the investment in microarray  technology  which corning discontinued at the end
of 2001

sales in the  conventional  video  components  business  decreased  29 or 102
million in 2001 compared to 2000 the decline was primarily due to a weak us
economy and increased  competitive  pricing pressure  earnings were down almost
50 due to lower sales volumes  decreased margins a production slowdown in the
fourth quarter and lower equity earnings samsung corning also experienced lower
sales  volumes  and  increased  competitive  pricing  pressure  and thus  lower
earnings

sales in cornings other technologies  businesses  decreased 4 or 15 million
in 2001  compared to 2000  excluding the  acquisition of tropel in march 2001
sales  decreased  11  the  decrease  was due to  softness  in the  market  for
ophthalmic  products  and high purity fused  silica  earnings for the year were
approximately breakeven and down slightly compared to 2000 lower sales volumes
and production  slowdowns were partially offset by a marginal increase in equity
earnings from eurokera  a french based  manufacturer of glass ceramic cooktops
which resulted in comparable earnings between years corning exited the lighting
and  tubing  businesses  in  2002  and  shutdown  manufacturing   facilities  in
greenville oh and corning ny

outlook  management  expects sales in the  technologies  segment to increase in
2003 versus 2002 due to increased desktop monitor  penetration rates  continued
global  clean air  emission  requirements  and a recovery  in the  semiconductor
market  most businesses in this segment are expected to increase sales with the
display technologies  business at the forefront  thus  management  anticipates
sales may  improve  175  million to 225  million  over 2002  corning  expects
profitability  in this  segment to improve  approximately  100  million to 120
million in 2003 primarily through increased sales volume and the achievement of
significant manufacturing gains this segment includes south korean based equity
companies that generated  equity earnings of 124 million in 2002  political or
economic  instability in that region could adversely impact these operations and
the results of this segment overall

nonsegment results

cornings nonsegment results include the operations of steuben a crystal glass
manufacturer  and equity earnings from small nonstrategic  investments that are
not aligned with cornings two operating segments  in addition  the results of
operating segments do not include amortization of goodwill  gain on repurchases
and  retirement of debt and  impairment  charges  related to pittsburgh  corning
corporation

liquidity and capital resources

sources of cash flow and key 2002 activities

in  2002  cornings  short  and  longterm  debt  ratings  were  downgraded  to
subinvestment  grade at this subinvestment  grade level corning is precluded
from accessing the shortterm  commercial paper market  cornings access to the
longterm  debt  markets  has been and will likely  continue to be limited  the
terms that corning  could  receive on new debt issues will likely be  consistent
with those generally available to high yield issuers

as an additional source of funds corning currently has full unrestricted access
to a 20 billion  revolving  credit facility with 16 banks  expiring on august
17 2005  as of december 31 2002  there were no  borrowings  under the credit
facility  the facility  includes one financial  covenant  limiting the ratio of
total debt to total  capital  as defined  to not greater than 60 at december
31 2002 and 2001 this ratio was 47 as disclosed in restructuring impairment
and other  charges  corning  recorded an  impairment  of goodwill in the fourth
quarter  further  declines  in the fair value of  cornings  telecommunications
segment  could cause  future  impairments  of goodwill  tangible or  intangible
assets or prompt  restructuring  actions  such  charges  could cause a material
increase to cornings debt to capital ratio

on december 13 2002  corning completed the sale of its precision lens business
to 3m for net proceeds of 787 million in cash  the  transaction  resulted in a
gain of 652  million  415  million  aftertax  in addition  corning  could
receive an  additional  50  million in cash in 2003  the  majority of which is
currently on deposit in escrow

in july and august  2002  corning  issued  575  million  shares of 7 series c
mandatory  convertible  preferred stock having a liquidation  preference of 100
per share  plus accrued and unpaid  dividends  resulting in gross  proceeds of
557 million the mandatory convertible stock has an annual dividend rate of 7
payable  quarterly  in cash  the first  dividend  payment date was november 16
2002  the dividends  are also payable  immediately  upon  conversion to corning
common  sock  at the time  corning  issued the series c  convertible  preferred
stock  a onetime  dividend was declared for all dividends that will be payable
from issuance through the mandatory  conversion date of august 16 2005 corning
secured the payment of the dividends  through the issuance of a promissory  note
and used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the series c preferred stock
to  purchase  117  million of us  treasury  securities  that were  pledged as
collateral  to secure the  payments on the  promissory  note  as a result  net
proceeds of the offering were 440 million  in addition  corning  redeemed the
remaining  69  thousand  shares of series b  preferred  stock for 7  million in
august

the  series c  preferred  stock  will  automatically  convert  on the  mandatory
conversion  date of august 16  2005  into  between  50813 and 625  shares of
corning common stock  depending on the then current  market price  at any time
prior to the mandatory conversion date holders may elect to convert in whole or
part of their  shares of series c preferred  stock into 50813  shares of common
stock plus an amount of cash  equal to the market  value at that time of the pro
rata share of the  collateral  portfolio  that secures the  promissory  note at
december 31 2002  approximately  42 million  shares of the series c preferred
stock had been converted into 2133 million common shares

as the closing  price of corning  common stock was 160 on july 31  2002  the
holder could immediately convert the series c preferred stock and obtain a value
of  10172  50813  shares  valued at 160 plus  2042 in future  dividends
indicating that the preferred stock contained a beneficial conversion feature of
172 per preferred share the beneficial  conversion totaled  approximately 10
million and was charged to the  accumulated  deficit in the third  quarter  the
beneficial  conversion  was also deducted from earnings  attributable  to common
shareholders in the 2002 earnings per share calculations

in march 2001 corning filed a universal shelf  registration  statement with the
us securities and exchange commission sec that became effective in the first
quarter  the shelf  permits the  issuance of up to 50 billion of various debt
and equity  securities  subsequent to the issuance above and as of december 31
2002   cornings   remaining   capacity  under  its  shelf   registration   was
approximately 35 billion

uses of cash and key 2002 activities

in  addition  to  funding  operations  in  2002  corning  used  cash  for  debt
repurchases capital spending and restructuring actions

during 2002 corning repurchased and retired zerocoupon  convertible debentures
with an accreted  value of 493 million in exchange for cash of 308 million for
the year ended december 31 2002  corning  recorded gains of 176 million 108
million  aftertax on these  transactions for the year ended december 31 2002
corning  recorded  the  gain  on  repurchases  as a  component  of  income  from
continuing  operations  as permitted by sfas no 145 the remaining  debentures
may be put back to corning on november 8 2005  at 81954 per debenture and on
november 8 2010 at 90529 per  debenture  corning has the option of settling
this  obligation in cash  common stock  or a combination of both from time to
time  corning may repurchase  certain additional debt securities in openmarket
or privately negotiated  transactions  through february 14 2003 corning spent
an additional 165 million to repurchase and retire more zero coupon convertible
debentures and expects to record a pretax gain of approximately  34 million in
the first quarter of 2003

corning also spent 233 million to retire its commercial paper borrowings during
2002  corning had no commercial  paper  borrowings as of december 31 2002 nor
does it anticipate issuing commercial paper in the foreseeable future in total
corning spent 815 million in 2002 to pay down short and longterm debt

corning reduced its capital  spending  dramatically in 2002 which reflected the
downturn  in  telecommunications  and was  part  of a  comprehensive  effort  to
conserve  cash  capital  spending  totaled 04 billion  17 billion and 15
billion in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the high level of capital spending
in  2001  and  2000  related  primarily  to  capacity  expansions  in  cornings
telecommunications  segment and expanded  research and  development  facilities
cornings  2003  capital  spending  program  is  expected  to be limited to 350
million to 450 million capital spending activity in 2003 is primarily expected
to be the planned  expansion  in the liquid  crystal  display and  environmental
businesses

during 2002 corning made payments of 256 million related to employee severance
and  termination  costs and 22  million  in other  exit  costs  resulting  from
restructuring actions  corning expects additional payments for actions taken in
2001 and 2002 to  approximate  290 million in 2003 in february  2003  corning
announced it will exit its optical switching product line and incur cash charges
of 20 million to 30 million

in the third  quarter of 2002  corning  repurchased  55 million  shares of its
common stock in a privately negotiated transaction for 23 million

key balance sheet data

at december 31 2002  cash and  shortterm  investments  totaled 21  billion
compared with 22 billion at december 31 2001  the decrease from december 31
2001 was  primarily due to short and longterm  debt  repayments  restructuring
payments and the use of working  capital  these items were partially  offset by
significantly  lower capital  spending  the sale of the precision lens business
and  proceeds  from the  issuance  of series c mandatory  convertible  preferred
stock

the increase in working  capital  excluding  cash and  shortterm  investments
reflected lower  shortterm  borrowings and accounts payable and the recognition
of an income tax  receivable  compared to december 31 2001 the increase in the
current  ratio  was  primarily  due  to  the  elimination  of  commercial  paper
borrowings  trade accounts receivable and inventories  decreased largely due to
significantly lower sales and sales volumes compared to 2001

in 2001 tax legislation was enacted in the us that extended the net operating
loss carryback period from two to five years  due to this  legislation  change
corning  will be  able to  carryback  the  anticipated  2002  us  federal  net
operating loss and claim a refund which would not have otherwise been available
other  accounts  receivable at december 31 2002  included a receivable of 192
million  as a result of corning  availing  itself of this  opportunity  corning
expects to receive this refund in the second quarter of 2003

credit ratings

cornings credit ratings as of february 18 2003 were as follows

note  all three rating agencies maintain a negative outlook

in july 2002 all three rating agencies announced a downgrade which is reflected
in the ratings  above  should  business  performance  decline  further from the
levels  experienced  in 2002  these ratings could  receive  further  review for
possible downgrade although the subinvestment grade ratings preclude cornings
access to the commercial paper market  cornings overall financial  flexibility
remains  adequate as a result of its cash position  shortterm  investments and
committed revolving credit facilities  cornings debt agreements do not include
covenants  that  accelerate the maturity of borrowings as a result of changes in
credit ratings

if business  performance  should decline  further from levels seen in the fourth
quarter of 2002 cornings ability to enter into foreign exchange contracts with
a duration of greater than one year could be adversely impacted such limitation
would not  significantly  impact  the  companys  current  hedging  program  in
addition  the  subinvestment  grade  credit  rating  has  in some  instances
resulted in requirements to deposit cash with  counterparties  under performance
surety bond and letter of credit arrangements at december 31 2002 82 million
of restricted cash was included in other longterm assets

a security  rating is not a  recommendation  to buy sell or hold securities and
may be subject to revision or  withdrawal  at any time by the  assigning  rating
organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating

management assessment of liquidity

cornings   2002   earnings  were  not  adequate  to  cover  its  fixed  charges
principally  interest  and related  charges on debt  primarily as a result of
losses incurred in cornings  telecommunications  segment  cornings  earnings
will likely not be sufficient to cover its fixed charges in 2003

cornings  major  source  of  funds  in 2003  will be its  cash  and  shortterm
investments management believes corning has ample liquidity to meet its funding
needs for 2003 and beyond  which  includes  funding  operations  restructuring
payments research and development and capital expenditures

at december 31 2002  corning had guaranteed  debt of equity  affiliates  which
totaled 14 million  in addition  corning and certain of its subsidiaries have
provided other  financial  guarantees and contingent  liabilities in the form of
purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones standby letters
of credit and  performance  bonds  some of which do not have fixed or scheduled
expiration dates corning has agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow
corning  corporation  as  discussed  in  note 10 to the  consolidated  financial
statements  the funding of the dow corning credit facility is subject to events
connected to the bankruptcy  plan as described in note 10  management  believes
the significant  majority of these  guarantees and contingent  liabilities  will
expire without being funded

corning has leased equipment from three unconsolidated  special purpose entities
spe for which the sole purpose is the leasing of  equipment to corning  these
spes are not  consolidated  in the 2002  financial  statements  since the equity
investor of the spe has made a  substantial  investment  that is at risk for the
life of the spe however the financial accounting standards board fasb issued
interpretation 46  consolidation of variable interest entities in january 2003
interpretation  46 will require the  consolidation of variable interest entities
vie by the primary  beneficiary  management is still assessing the impacts of
this  interpretation  however  it is reasonably  possible that corning will be
considered  the  primary  beneficiary  of the three  vies  and  therefore  will
consolidate  these entities  beginning on july 1 2003 as of december 31 2002
the total assets in unconsolidated vies were 46 million in addition cornings
maximum  loss  exposure  as a result of its  involvement  with these vies is 46
million  this amount  represents  payments  that would be due to the vie in the
event of a total loss of the equipment  corning carries insurance  coverage for
this risk

pensions

corning has a number of defined benefit pension plans covering  certain domestic
and international  employees  its largest single pension plan is cornings us
qualified  plan at december 31 2002  this plan accounted for 83 of cornings
consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and 89
of the related  plans  assets  in 2002  global  capital  market  developments
resulted in negative returns on this plans assets and a decline in the discount
rate used to estimate the related pension  liability  as a result  at december
31 2002 this us plans  accumulated  benefit  obligation  abo exceeded the
fair value of its assets which required corning to record an additional minimum
pension  liability in accordance  with sfas no 87  employers  accounting for
pensions  the  effect of this  noncash  adjustment  was to  increase  pension
liabilities  by 322  million  increase  intangible  assets by 61  million and
increase other comprehensive loss by 261 million 161 million aftertax


page



corning has traditionally  contributed to this qualified us pension plan on an
annual  basis  over the last ten years  voluntary  contributions  averaged 25
million  a year  corning  has  historically  contributed  in  excess of the irs
minimum requirements  and as a result mandatory contributions are not expected
to be required  for this us  plan until 2006  in the fourth  quarter of 2002
corning made voluntary  pension  contributions to this us plan of 30 million
resulting in total contributions for the year of 56 million corning expects to
increase the level of voluntary  contributions  to this us  plan over the next
few years for 2003 corning anticipates making voluntary contributions totaling
60 million to this plan

critical accounting policies and estimates

the preparation of financial  statements  requires  management to make estimates
and  assumptions  that affect  amounts  reported  therein  the  estimates  that
required  managements  most  difficult  subjective  or complex  judgments  are
described below

impairment of goodwill in the telecommunications reporting unit

sfas no 142  goodwill and other intangible  assets  requires  management to
make judgments about the fair value of its reporting unit corning measures fair
value on the basis of discounted  expected future cash flows the  determination
of expected future cash flows involves  judgment  cornings  judgment was based
upon our historical experience in the  telecommunications  business our current
knowledge from our commercial relationships  and available external information
about future trends with this input it is managements  expectation that there
will be minimal  volume  growth in the short term  volume  growth is assumed to
accelerate beginning in 2005 commensurate with overall market recovery terminal
value of the business assumes a growth in perpetuity of 3 these cash flows are
also used to value  intangible and tangible  assets which  determine the implied
value of reporting unit goodwill  the discount rate applied to these cash flows
represents a  telecommunications  weighted  average  cost of capital  based upon
current debt and equity  activity of 11 public  companies  representing  a cross
section of worldwide  competitors of the reporting unit corning used a discount
rate of 12 in its  calculation of fair value of the expected  future cash flows
and recorded an impairment  charge of 400 million  had corning used a discount
rate of 115  the fair value of the  reporting  unit would have  exceeded  its
carrying value and there would not have been an  impairment  had corning used a
discount  rate  of  125  the  pretax   impairment  charge  would  have  been
approximately 225 million higher

impairment of assets held for use

sfas no 144  accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets
requires  management  to assess  the  recoverability  of the  carrying  value of
longlived  assets when an event of  impairment  has occurred  management  must
exercise  judgment in assessing  whether an event of  impairment  has  occurred
corning  concluded events of impairment had occurred in two of its businesses in
the fourth quarter of 2002 and the company  recorded  pretax  charges  totaling
409 million  in each  circumstance  behavior of external  parties  including
customers  and  competitors  were  considered  in  the  determination  that  an
assessment for impairment was required  management must also exercise  judgment
in the  determination of expected future cash flows against which to compare the
carrying value of the asset group being  evaluated  in both  measurements  the
carrying value far exceeded the expected cash flows  management  then exercised
judgment in  determining  the fair value of the assets from which the impairment
charge was measured  for its photonic technologies  business  management based
the fair value of its  longlived  assets on the actual  results of recent asset
auctions  of  similar  equipment  for  the  conventional  television  business
management   exercised   judgment  about  alternative  volume  and  sales  price
scenarios  computed  discounted  cash flows and assigned  its best  estimate of
probability to each alternative  management has reduced the useful lives of the
fixed assets of this business as a result of this assessment

restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions

during  2001 and 2002  corning  recorded  writedowns  of  property  plant and
equipment  as a  result  of  decisions  to  exit  facilities  primarily  in the
telecommunications   segment   assets   impaired  were   primarily   equipment
construction in progress and buildings  some of the equipment is to be sold and
some  abandoned  corning used  information  available  from recent  auctions of
telecommunications   equipment  to  estimate   salvage   value  when   measuring
impairment  the  estimated  salvage  values are very low  primarily due to the
currently depressed market for telecommunications related equipment the salvage
values of  property  impaired  were also  estimated  to be  minimal  as  certain
facilities  will be abandoned and not sold  it is possible that actual  results
will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to reserves

valuation allowances for deferred income taxes

sfas no 109  accounting  for income taxes  requires  management to exercise
judgment about its future results in assessing the realizability of its deferred
tax assets at december 31 2002  corning had gross deferred tax assets of 18
billion  corning  determined  that the  likelihood  of  realization  of certain
deferred tax assets is less than 50 and recorded  valuation  allowances of 417
million   if  future  taxable  income  differs  from   managements   estimate
adjustments  to these  allowances  will be required  and will impact  future net
income

probability of litigation outcomes

sfas  no  5  accounting  for  contingencies  requires  management  to  make
judgments  about  future  events that are  inherently  uncertain  in making its
determinations of likely outcomes of litigation  matters  management  considers
the evaluation of outside counsel  knowledgeable  about each matter  as well as
known  outcomes  in case law  see item 3  legal  proceedings  for a detailed
discussion of the key litigation matters the company faces the most significant
matter  involving  managements  most  complex  judgment  is that of  pittsburgh
corning  corporation  there are a number of factors  bearing upon the companys
potential  liability  including the inherent complexity of a chapter 11 filing
the companys  history of success in defending  itself against  asbestos claims
the companys  assessment of the strength of its corporate  veil  defenses  the
companys  continuing  dialogue with its insurance  carriers and the  claimants
representatives  and other factors the companys conclusion subject to change
as future events unfold  is that there is no guarantee that a global settlement
can or will be  reached  and that it is more  likely  than not that the company
will continue to litigate

pension assumptions

in 2002 management made a change in assumption that will impact pension expense
in future periods  specifically  management has lowered its expected longterm
rate of return on pension assets from 9 to 85 management has not altered the
nature of the pension trust investments recent asset performance has been below
the 9  assumption  as  such  it is  lowering  its  longterm  rate of  return
assumption  this  will  increase  cornings  pension  expense  as  measured  in
accordance with sfas no 87  employers  accounting for pension  compared to
amounts recorded in 2002 the increase will approximate 8 million in 2003

inprocess research and development

corning  completed  a  number  of  purchase  acquisitions  in  2000  as part of
analyzing each of these acquisitions  corning made a decision to buy technology
that  had not  yet  been  commercialized  rather  than  develop  the  technology
internally  corning based this  decision on a number of factors  including the
amount of time it would take to bring the  technology  to market  corning  also
considered  its  internal  research  resource  allocation  and its  progress  on
comparable technology  if any corning expects to use the same decision process
in the future

in connection  with the  acquisitions  accounted for under the purchase  method
management  is  responsible  for  estimating  the fair  value of the  assets and
liabilities acquired  management has made estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported  amounts of assets  liabilities  and expenses  resulting from such
acquisitions

amounts  allocated  to  purchased  iprd  were  established   through  recognized
valuation  techniques in the high technology  communications  industry  certain
projects  were  acquired  for  which  technological  feasibility  had  not  been
established at the date of acquisition and for which no alternative  future uses
existed in accordance with sfas no 2 accounting for research and development
costs as  interpreted by fasb  interpretation  no 4  applicability  of fasb
statement no 2 to business combinations  accounted for by the purchase method
amounts  assigned to iprd meeting the above  criteria must be charged to expense
at the date of consummation of the purchase

the value  allocated to projects for which a charge was recorded was  determined
by the traditional  income approach  which discounts  expected future debtfree
income to present  value  the discount rates used were specific to each project
and were derived from a cost of capital for each  specific  acquisition  target
adjusted upward for the stage of completion of each project


page



expected future debtfree income was derived with the following considerations

    revenues were estimated based on relevant market size growth trends in the
     industry and individual product sales cycles
    estimated operating expenses included cost of goods sold selling  general
     and  administrative  expenses  and  research and  development  expenses to
     maintain the products once they have been introduced
    estimated tax expenses  were  specific to each acquired  entity and its tax
     profile and
    for certain  projects  as  appropriate  a return on core  technology  was
     deducted based upon market standards for licensed existing technology and a
     return on assets was deducted based upon industry comparisons

the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired  technology into  commercially
viable  products  consists  principally  of  planning   designing  and  testing
activities necessary to determine that the product can meet market expectations
corning expected that products  incorporating the acquired technology from these
projects  will be completed  and will begin to generate cash flows over the five
years following integration

the timing and success of development of the technologies not abandoned  remains
a risk due to the  remaining  effort to  achieve  technical  viability  rapidly
changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products and significant
competition in the marketplace

the following is a more detailed  discussion of the valuations  associated  with
acquisitions for which such charges have been recorded

acquisition of pirellis optical components and devices business


on december 12 2000 corning completed the pirelli  transaction  this business
had a significant  number of research and  development  projects  ongoing at the
time of  acquisition  of  which  12 were  valued  as  iprd  projects  projected
debtfree  income was  initially  discounted  using a rate of 17 to reflect the
weightedaverage cost of capital entity risk for this entity each product was
also  discounted  to account for the research  projects  stage of  development
corning recorded a nontax  deductible iprd charge of 323 million in the fourth
quarter of 2000

costs to complete the inprocess research programs were originally  estimated to
approximate  25 million to 30 million at the valuation  date  these  projects
have been categorized into four product technologies as follows

lithium niobate modulators

the business is  developing a number of different  lithium  niobate  modulators
lithium niobate  modulators are ideally suited for use in highspeed  longhaul
optical communications networks the technology has been chosen by a majority of
longhaul  equipment  suppliers  because it has the best combination of optical
electronic and reliability performance  five of the research projects qualified
as iprd projects and the completion  percentages  of these five projects  ranged
from 10 to 90 a nontax  deductible charge of 235 million was recognized and
the value of individual modulator projects inprocess ranged from 19 million to
83 million

corning plans to continue research on lithium niobate modulators  however  due
to the downturn in the telecommunications industry future revenues expected from
these projects will be significantly less than originally estimated

submarine products

the business had planned to develop high  reliability  980  nanometer  nm pump
laser chips and modules for submarine use  these devices are components  within
an optical amplifier at the acquisition date two iprd projects with completion
percentages  of 10 and 50 were  valued  a  nontax  deductible  charge of 26
million  resulted  from  980  nm  pump  laser  submarine  projects  in  process
individual research values were 3 million and 23 million

as part of the  downsizing of the photonic  technologies  business  announced on
july 9  2001  corning  abandoned  this  project  this  action  did not have a
material impact on cash flow or the results of operations


page



gratings

at the date of acquisition  three qualifying  gratings programs with completion
percentages  ranging  from 20 to 85 were  valued  a nontax  deductible  iprd
charge of 16 million  resulted from gratings  programs  individual  inprocess
projects were valued between 2 million and 11 million

as part of the  downsizing of the photonic  technologies  business  announced on
july 9  2001  corning  abandoned  this  project  this  action  did not have a
material impact on cash flow or the results of operations

specialty fiber

two  specialty  fiber  programs  at the  business  met the  definition  of iprd
specialty  fibers are used in conjunction  with several other components to make
an erbium  doped  fiber  amplifier  which  boosts the  strength  of the optical
signal  at the acquisition  date  these projects were 40 and 60 complete  a
nontax  deductible  iprd charge of 46 million  resulted from  specialty  fiber
programs with the largest program being valued at 42 million

corning plans to continue research in specialty fiber

intellisense


on june 12 2000  corning  completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of
intellisense  a manufacturer and developer of microelectromechanical  systems
mems or small electromechanical  microfabricated devices mems technology
when integrated with optics and packaging expertise  enables the development of
optical adddrop switches and optical cross connects  that are expected to play
a key role in the development and buildout of the optical  networking  layer as
of the acquisition  date  intellisense had three qualifying  research  projects
underway  these  research and  development  projects are  anticipated to result
primarily  in the  development  of new  telecommunications  products  projected
debtfree  income was  initially  discounted  using a rate of 20 to reflect the
weightedaverage  cost of capital entity risk for  intellisense  each product
was also discounted to account for the research  projects stage of development
the completion  percentages ranged from 10 to 90 at the acquisition date the
projected costs to complete the iprd programs approximated 20 million  corning
recorded a 7 million  iprd  charge in the  second  quarter of 2000  no project
valued exceeded 5 million

failure of any single project would not materially  impact  cornings  financial
condition results of operations or liquidity

as of december 31 2002  one of the projects has been  canceled  the other two
projects are  continuing  with one at a reduced level  as a result  the future
revenues expected from these projects will be significantly less than originally
estimated

nz applied technologies


on may 5 2000  corning  completed the  acquisition of nz applied  technologies
nzat  nzat was  developing a line of high speed  solidstate  components for
dense  wavelength  division  multiplexing  systems  such  as  variable  optical
attenuators  that will meet  industry  demands for speed and quality  of these
projects four were determined to meet the criteria for purchased iprd as of the
acquisition date  projected  debtfree income was initially  discounted using a
rate of 21 to reflect the  weightedaverage  cost of capital  entity risk for
nzat  each product was also  discounted  to account for the research  projects
stage of development  the completion percentages ranged from 10 to 80 at the
acquisition date the projected costs to complete the iprd programs approximated
10 million a 44 million nontax deductible iprd charge was recognized and the
value of individual projects ranged from 1 million to 29 million

in the third  quarter of 2002  due to the  significant  downturn  in demand for
telecommunication  products  corning decided to suspend the research related to
these  projects  when  the  demand  for  cornings  telecommunication  products
rebound  management will reevaluate the market at that time and a decision will
be made as to whether research and development on these projects should resume

photonics technology research center


on february 14 2000 corning acquired the photonics  technology research center
ptrc  located in suffolk uk the ptrc had extensive research and development
efforts  underway at the  acquisition  date including work on planar  integrated
optics  semiconductor  optical  amplifiers  electroabsorption  modulators and
optical networking devices  seven projects were determined to meet the criteria
for purchased iprd  projected  debtfree  income was determined for each of the
projects  and  initially   discounted  using  a  rate  of  35  to  reflect  the
weightedaverage  cost of capital  entity risk for ptrc each product was also
discounted  to account for the  research  projects  stage of  development  the
completion  percentages  ranged from 50 to 80 at the  acquisition  date  the
projected costs to complete the iprd programs  approximated  40 million  a 42
million  25 million  aftertax  iprd charge was  recognized  and the value of
individual projects ranged from less than 1 million to 16 million

in the fourth  quarter of 2002  due to the  significant  downturn in demand for
telecommunication  products  corning announced it would close this facility and
abandon most of the projects  research will continue  related to  semiconductor
optical   amplifiers  and   electroabsorption   modulators  at  other  research
facilities  as a result  the future revenues expected from these projects will
be significantly less than originally estimated

environment

corning  has  been  named  by the  environmental  protection  agency  under  the
superfund  act  or  by  state  governments  under  similar  state  laws  as  a
potentially  responsible  party for 12 active  hazardous waste sites  under the
superfund  act  all parties who may have  contributed  any waste to a hazardous
waste site  identified by such agency are jointly and severally liable for the
cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees  otherwise  it is cornings  policy to
accrue  for its  estimated  liability  related  to  superfund  sites  and  other
environmental  liabilities  related to  property  owned and  operated by corning
based on expert analysis and continual  monitoring by both internal and external
consultants  corning has accrued  approximately  22 million for its  estimated
liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation at december 31 2002
based upon the  information  developed  to date  management  believes  that the
accrued  amount is a reasonable  estimate of cornings  estimated  liability and
that the risk of an  additional  loss in an amount  materially  higher than that
accrued is remote

in june 2001  the fasb issued sfas no 143  accounting  for asset  retirement
obligations  this standard  addresses  financial  accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the
associated  asset retirement  costs  corning was required to implement sfas no
143 on january 1 2003 corning does not expect this standard to have a material
impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations

in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144  accounting for the impairment or
disposal  of  longlived   assets  this  standard  supercedes  sfas  no  121
accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to
be  disposed  of the  standard  retains  the  previously  existing  accounting
requirements  related to the  recognition  and  measurement of the impairment of
longlived   assets  to  be  held  and  used  while  expanding  the  measurement
requirements  of  longlived  assets  to be  disposed  of  by  sale  to  include
discontinued  operations  it also expands on the previously  existing reporting
requirements  for  discontinued  operations  to include a component of an entity
that either has been  disposed  of or is  classified  as held for sale  corning
adopted sfas no 144 on january 1 2002  corning has followed  this standard to
measure  impairments  of  longlived  assets  through  2002 and report  business
divestitures

in april  2002  the fasb  issued  sfas no  145  which  rescinds  sfas no  4
reporting  gains  and  losses  from  extinguishment  of  debt  sfas  no  44
accounting  for  intangible   assets  of  motor  carriers  and  sfas  no  64
extinguishments of debt made to satisfy  sinkingfund  requirements and amends
sfas no 13  accounting  for leases this  statement  updates  clarifies and
simplifies  existing accounting  pronouncements  as a result of rescinding sfas
no 4 and sfas no 64 the criteria in accounting  principles bulletin apb no
30 will be used to  classify  gains  and  losses  from  extinguishment  of debt
corning adopted the reporting  guidance of sfas no 145 in the second quarter of
2002 in its  accounting for  repurchases  and retirement of debt see note 14 to
the consolidated financial statements  the remaining provisions of sfas no 145
will be  adopted by corning  in fiscal  year 2003  corning  does not expect the
adoption  of  the  remaining  provisions  to  have  a  material  impact  on  its
consolidated financial position or results of operations

in june 2002  the fasb issued sfas no 146  accounting  for costs  associated
with exit or disposal  activities this standard nullifies emerging issues task
force issue no 943  liability  recognition for certain employee  termination
benefits and other costs to exit an activity  including  certain costs incurred
in a  restructuring  this  standard  requires  that  a  liability  for a cost
associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is
incurred rather than the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan corning
is  required  to  implement  sfas no 146 on january 1 2003  corning  does not
expect this  standard to have a material  impact on its  consolidated  financial
position or results of operations

in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 guarantors accounting
and disclosure  requirements for guarantees  including  indirect  guarantees of
indebtedness of others which expands previously issued accounting guidance and
disclosure  requirements for certain guarantees  the interpretation requires an
entity to recognize  an initial  liability  for the fair value of an  obligation
assumed by issuing a  guarantee  the  provision  for  initial  recognition  and
measurement  of  the  liability  will  be  applied  on a  prospective  basis  to
guarantees  issued or modified after december 31 2002  corning does not expect
this  interpretation  to have a material  impact on its  consolidated  financial
position or results of operations

in december  2002  the fasb issued sfas no 148  accounting  for  stockbased
compensation   transition  and  disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no
123 which provides optional  transition  guidance for those companies electing
to voluntarily adopt the accounting provisions of sfas no 123 in addition the
statement  mandates  certain interim  disclosures  that are incremental to those
required  by sfas no 123  corning  will  continue  to account for  stockbased
compensation  in  accordance  with apb no 25 as such  corning does not expect
this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated  financial  position
or results of operations  corning has adopted the disclosureonly provisions of
sfas no 148 at december 31 2002

in january  2003  the fasb  issued  interpretation  no 46  consolidation  of
variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51 which requires all
vies to be consolidated by the primary  beneficiary  the primary beneficiary is
the entity that holds the  majority of the  beneficial  interests in the vie in
addition the interpretation expands disclosure  requirements for both vies that
are  consolidated  as well as vies  from  which the  entity  is the  holder of a
significant  amount  of the  beneficial  interests  but not the  majority  the
disclosure  requirements of this  interpretation are effective for all financial
statements issued after january 31 2003 the consolidation requirements of this
interpretation  are  effective  for all periods  beginning  after june 15 2003
management is still assessing the impacts of this interpretation however it is
reasonably  possible that corning will be considered the primary  beneficiary of
three  existing  spes and therefore  would need to  consolidate  these  entities
beginning on july 1 2003 the assets and debt of these entities at december 31
2002 approximates 46 million

item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks


corning operates and conducts business in many foreign countries and as a result
is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates  cornings  exposure
to exchange rate effects includes

    exchange  rate  movements  on  financial   instruments   and   transactions
     denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings and
    exchange  rate  movements   upon   conversion  of  net  assets  in  foreign
     subsidiaries  for which the  functional  currency  is not the us  dollar
     which impact cornings net equity

cornings most significant  foreign currency  exposures relate to japan  korea
taiwan and western european  countries  corning selectively enters into foreign
exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 12 months or less
to hedge its  exposure  to  exchange  rate risk on  foreign  source  income  and
purchases  the hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the
underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions the objective of these
contracts is to neutralize  the impact of exchange  rate  movements on cornings
operating  results  corning also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts
when situations  arise where its foreign  subsidiaries  or corning  incorporated
enter into lending situations  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated
in  currencies  other than their  local  currency  corning  holds a  derivative
contract that hedges certain foreign  currency  denominated net asset exposures
corning  does not hold or issue  derivative  financial  instruments  for trading
purposes

equity in  earnings of  associated  companies  has  historically  represented  a
significant amount of cornings loss income from continuing operations equity
in earnings of associated  companies net of impairments was 116 million in 2002
with  foreignbased  affiliates  comprising  over 100 of this amount due to the
impairments  recorded in equity  income  samsung  corning  and samsung  corning
precision glass totaled 124 million in equity earnings for 2002  exchange rate
fluctuations  and actions taken by  management of these  entities to reduce this
risk can affect the earnings of these companies

corning uses a sensitivity  analysis to assess the market risk  associated  with
its foreign  currency  exchange  risk  market risk is defined as the  potential
change  in fair  value of  assets  and  liabilities  resulting  from an  adverse
movement in foreign currency  exchange rates at december 31 2002  corning and
its consolidated subsidiaries had open forward contracts open option contracts
foreign  denominated  debt and foreign cash and cash  equivalent  holdings  with
values  exposed to exchange  rate  movements  all of which were  designated  as
hedges at december 31 2002 a 10 adverse  movement in quoted foreign  currency
exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of 117
million

the nature of cornings  foreign  exchange  rate risk  exposures has not changed
materially from december 31 2001

interest rate risk management

in march and april of 2002  corning  entered into  interest rate swaps that are
fair  value  hedges  and  economically  exchanged  275  million  of fixed  rate
longterm  debt to floating rate debt  under the terms of the swap  agreements
corning  will pay the  counterparty  a  floating  rate  that is  indexed  to the
sixmonth  libor rate and receive  the fixed rates of 83 to 8875  which are
the stated  interest  rates on the longterm  debt  instruments  as a result of
these  transactions  corning is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes
the interest rate on these instruments is reset every six months and they expire
in 14 to 23 years it is cornings policy to conservatively  manage its exposure
to changes in  interest  rates  cornings  policy is that  total  floating  and
variable  rate debt will not exceed 35 of the total debt  portfolio at anytime
at  december  31  2002   cornings   consolidated  debt  portfolio   contained
approximately 8 of variable rate instruments

competition

corning  competes  across  all of its  product  lines with many large and varied
manufacturers  both domestic and foreign  some of these competitors are larger
than corning and some have broader product lines

competition  within the  telecommunications  industry is intense  among  several
significant  companies  corning  represents an important market presence in the
segments  principal  product  lines  price  and new  product  innovations  are
significant  competitive factors the current downturn in the telecommunications
industry may change the competitive landscape in the future

within  the  advanced  materials  segment  cornings  principal  products  face
competition from a variety of materials manufacturers some of which manufacture
similar products made from materials other than glass and ceramics  among other
things innovation product quality performance and service are key competitive
elements  competition  is  also  intense  for  certain  businesses  within  the
information display segment as new entrants may be able to offer lower prices

corning strives to maintain its market position  through  technology and product
innovation  for  the  future  cornings  competitive  advantage  lies  in  its
commitment  to  research  and  development  its  financial  resources  and  its
commitment  to  quality  there is no  assurance  that  corning  will be able to
maintain its market position or competitive advantage

raw materials

cornings  production  of  specialty  glasses  and  related  materials  requires
significant quantities of energy and batch materials

although energy shortages have not been a problem recently corning has achieved
flexibility  through  important  engineering  changes to take  advantage  of the
lowestcost energy source in most significant processes specifically cornings
principal manufacturing processes can now be operated with natural gas propane
oil or electricity or a combination of these energy sources

as  to  resources  ores   minerals   and  processed  chemicals  required  in
manufacturing  operations   availability  appears  to  be  adequate  cornings
suppliers  from time to time may  experience  capacity  limitations in their own
operations  or may  eliminate  certain  product  lines  nevertheless  corning
believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch chemicals
and raw materials for many products corning has alternative glass compositions
that would allow  operations to continue  without  interruption  in the event of
specific materials shortages

certain key optical  components  used in the  manufacturing  of products  within
cornings telecommunications segment are currently available only from a limited
number of sources  any future  difficulty  in obtaining  sufficient  and timely
delivery  of  components  could  result  in  delays  or  reductions  in  product
shipments or reduce cornings gross margins

patents and trademarks

inventions by members of cornings research and engineering staff have been and
continue to be important to the companys growth  patents have been granted on
many of these inventions in the united states and other countries some of these
patents  have  been  licensed  to  other   manufacturers   including  cornings
associated companies many of the earlier patents have now expired

most of cornings products are marketed under the following trademarks corning
celcor costar  fibergain  hpfs leaf metrocor  purepath pyrex steuben and
vycor   subsidiaries  and  divisions  of  corning   frequently  use  their  own
trademarks

protection of the environment

corning  has a program to ensure  that its  facilities  are in  compliance  with
state federal and foreign pollutioncontrol  regulations this program resulted
in capital and operating expenditures during the past several years in order to
maintain  compliance with such regulations  capital  expenditures for pollution
control in continuing  operations were approximately 64 million in 2001 and are
estimated to be 12 million in 2002

cornings 2001 operating  results from  continuing  operations were charged with
approximately  59 million for  depreciation  maintenance  waste  disposal and
other operating  expenses  associated with pollution  control  corning believes
that its compliance program will not place it at a competitive disadvantage

risk factors

the  following  cautionary  statements  are not exclusive and are in addition to
other factors  discussed  elsewhere in this annual report  in cornings filings
with the securities and exchange commission or in materials incorporated therein
by reference

our  sales  could be  negatively  impacted  if one or more of our key  customers
substantially reduced orders for our products

our customer base is relatively  concentrated  and a modest number of customers
account  for  a  high  percentage  of  net  sales  in  our   telecommunications
environmental  products and information  display product  businesses  if we are
unable to establish or maintain good relationships with key customers  it could
negatively affect our results of operations and financial performance

some of our major  customers  have reduced  modified  cancelled or rescheduled
orders  for our  products  and have  expressed  uncertainty  as to their  future
requirements  as a result  our sales  have  declined  and it is  difficult  to
predict future sales accurately  the conditions contributing to this difficulty
include

    uncertainty   regarding   the   capital   spending   plans  of  the   major
     telecommunications  carriers  upon whom our customers and  ultimately we
     depend for sales

    the  telecommunications  carriers  current  limited  access to the capital
     required for expansion and

    general market and economic uncertainty

the current economic downturn may be more severe and prolonged than expected if
our net sales continue to decline  our ability to return to  profitability  and
improve free cash flow for future periods may be impeded

                                       2

if  we  do  not  successfully  adjust  our  manufacturing  volumes  or  achieve
manufacturing  yields or sufficient product reliability  our operating results
could suffer

in the current  economic  downturn  we have  responded to the softer  market by
cutting  costs  including the reduction of our  manufacturing  volumes  in the
third and fourth quarters of 2001 we approved and began executing  formal plans
to close seven major  manufacturing  facilities  and downsize  our  workforce by
approximately 12000 positions  we cannot assure you that we have mitigated the
adverse  effects  of a softer  market  nor can we  assure  you that  additional
adjustments will not be necessary to respond to further market changes

the manufacture of our products  involves highly complex and precise  processes
requiring production in highly controlled and clean environments changes in our
manufacturing  processes  or those of our suppliers could significantly  reduce
our  manufacturing  yields and  product  reliability  in some  cases  existing
manufacturing  techniques  which  involve  substantial  manual  labor  may  be
insufficient  to achieve the volume  or cost targets of our customers  we will
need to develop new  manufacturing  processes and techniques to achieve targeted
volume and cost levels  while we continue to devote substantial  efforts to the
improvement of our  manufacturing  techniques and processes  we may not achieve
cost  levels  in our  manufacturing  activities  that  will  fully  satisfy  our
customers

we have incurred and may in the future incur restructuring  inventoryrelated
and other charges the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately

as a result of the business  downturn  we approved and began  executing  formal
plans to close seven major  manufacturing  facilities and downsize our workforce
by approximately  12000 positions  as a result of these actions we recorded a
total  charge  of  961  million  590  million  aftertax  which  included  a
restructuring  charge of 419 million and a charge to impair plant and equipment
of 542 million  we also recorded pretax charges totaling 333 million for the
writedown of excess and obsolete inventory in the second and fourth quarters of
2001  our  ability to forecast  our  customers  needs for our  products in the
current economic  environment is very limited  accordingly  additional charges
for restructuring  inventory adjustments  or writedowns and other charges may
be  required  if  the  business  downturn  is  more  severe  than  we  currently
anticipate

if the  markets for our  products  do not  develop and expand as we  anticipate
demand for our products may decline  which would negatively  impact our results
of operations and financial performance

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies
evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions  our success
is  expected  to depend  in  substantial  part  on the  timely and  successful
introduction  of new  products  upgrades  of current  products  to comply  with
emerging  industry  standards  our  ability to acquire  technologies  needed to
remain  competitive  and our  ability  to  address  competing  technologies  and
products  in addition  the following  factors  related to our products and the
markets for them could have an adverse  impact on our results of operations  and
financial performance

    if we are unable to introduce  optical fiber or any other leading products
     such as our glass for flat  panel  displays  that can  command  competitive
     prices in the marketplace

    if we are unable to  achieve  or  maintain a  favorable  mix of  products
     including a mix of sales between premium and nonpremium products

    a decline  in  demand  or an  unanticipated  change in market  demand  for
     specific products

    if we are unable to continue  to develop  new product  lines to address our
     customers  diverse  needs within the several  market  segments in which we
     participate  this  requires  a high  level of  innovation  as well as the
     accurate anticipation of technological and market trends or

    if we are not successful in creating the infrastructure required to support
     anticipated growth in product demand

                                       3

we face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely
affect our results of operations and financial performance

we are currently facing pricing  pressures in several of our leading  businesses
as a result  of  intense  competition  emerging  new  technologies  and  excess
manufacturing capacity in both the domestic and the international  marketplaces
while we will work toward reducing our costs to respond to pricing pressures we
may not be able to achieve  proportionate  reductions  in costs  as a result of
potential overcapacity and the current economic downturn  pricing pressures may
increase in the foreseeable future

we have  incurred and may in the future  incur  goodwill  and other  intangible
asset impairment charges

acquisitions recorded as purchases for accounting purposes have resulted and in
the future may result in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and
other purchased  intangibles  the  amortization  and impairment of these assets
through  2001  and  potential   impairment  of  these  assets   thereafter   has
significantly reduced and could further reduce our net income

during the first half of 2001 we experienced a significant decrease in the rate
of  growth  of  our  telecommunications   segment  primarily  in  the  photonic
technologies business  due to a dramatic decline in infrastructure  spending in
the telecommunications  industry  during the second quarter major customers in
the photonic  technologies  business reduced their order forecasts and cancelled
orders already placed  management  determined that the growth prospects of this
business  were  significantly  less  than  previously   expected  and  those  of
historical  periods  as a result  we determined  that the  longlived  assets
including  goodwill  and  other  intangibles  acquired  in  connection  with our
acquisition of optical  technologies  usa from pirelli and cisco systems and our
acquisition of netoptix corporation were not recoverable in the second quarter
of 2001 we recorded a pretax charge of approximately 476 billion to impair a
significant  portion of the goodwill and other  intangible  assets in connection
with these acquisitions

in june 2001  the  financial  accounting  standards  board issued  statement of
financial accounting standards sfas no 142 pursuant to which goodwill will no
longer be amortized  but will be subject to impairment tests at least annually
sfas no 142 was  effective  for us on january 1  2002  an  assessment  of the
recoverability  of goodwill  recorded on the date of adoption  must be performed
within one year we do not anticipate a transitional  impairment charge from the
adoption of the standard however future changes in the expected performance of
our businesses could cause us to take further  impairment  charges  at december
31 2001 corning had 19 billion in goodwill

we may be limited in our ability to obtain  additional  capital on  commercially
reasonable terms

although we believe existing cash shortterm investments operating cash flows
access to capital markets and borrowing capacity collectively provide adequate
resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures
relating to the expansion of existing  businesses  and  acquisitions  we may be
required to seek additional  financing to compete  effectively in these markets
our public  debt  ratings  affect our ability to raise debt and the cost of such
debt in february 2002  fitch  downgraded our longterm rating from bbb to bbb
with a negative  outlook  in november  2001  standard  poors  downgraded our
corporate rating from a to bbb and maintained a negative outlook while removing
us from creditwatch with negative  implications  and moodys reduced our senior
debt  rating  from a3 to baa1 with a  negative  outlook  these and any  further
downgrades  could increase  borrowing costs and affect our ability to access the
debt capital  markets  including the commercial  paper market  on a consistent
basis  the  pricing  of our  common  stock may limit our  ability to access the
equity capital markets on terms and in amounts that would be satisfactory to us

difficulties we may encounter in managing our growth could adversely  affect our
results of operations

we have  historically  achieved  growth  through  a  combination  of  internally
developed  new products and  acquisitions  our growth  strategy  depends on our
ability to continue  developing or acquiring new products for our customer base
we expect to  continue  to pursue  acquisitions  of other  companies  as well as
equity  ventures to develop new  technologies  and  product  lines  although we
cannot guarantee that we will be successful or that we will have cash or equity
sufficient to complete strategic  acquisitions  the success of each acquisition
will depend in part upon our ability

    to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our organization

                                       4

page

    to  manufacture  and  sell  the  products  of the  businesses  acquired  at
     satisfactory prices and gross margins

    to retain key personnel of the acquired businesses

    to apply our financial and  management  controls and reporting  systems and
     procedures to the acquired businesses and

    to successfully complete technology initiatives

if  our  products  or  components   purchased  from  our  suppliers   experience
performance issues our business will suffer

our business depends on our producing  excellent  products of consistently  high
quality  to this end our products  including  components  purchased  from our
suppliers  are  rigorously  tested for  quality  both by us and our  customers
nevertheless  our  products  are  highly  complex  and our  customers  testing
procedures are limited to evaluating  our products under likely and  foreseeable
failure scenarios for various reasons including  among others the occurrence
of performance problems  unforeseeable in testing  our products and components
purchased from our suppliers may fail to perform as expected performance issues
could  result  from  faulty  design  or  problems  in  manufacturing   we  have
experienced  such  performance  issues in the past and  remain  exposed  to such
performance  issues  in some cases  product  redesigns or  additional  capital
equipment may be required to correct a defect  in addition  any significant or
systemic  product  failure  could  result in lost future  sales of the  affected
product and other products as well as result in customer relations problems

interruptions  of  supplies  from our key  suppliers  may affect our  results of
operations and financial performance

interruptions  of supplies from our key suppliers could disrupt  production  or
impact our ability to increase  production and sales we obtain several critical
components used in the production of telecommunications  products from a limited
number  of  suppliers  some of which are also our  competitors  we do not have
longterm  or volume  purchase  agreements  with  every  supplier  and may have
limited options for  alternative  supply if these suppliers fail to continue the
supply of components

we face intense competition in several of our businesses

we face intense competition in several of our businesses we expect that we will
face  additional  competition  from  existing  competitors  and from a number of
companies  that may enter our  markets  since  some of the  markets in which we
compete are characterized by rapid growth and rapid technology changes  smaller
niche and startup companies may become our principal competitors in the future
we  must  invest  in  research   and   development   expand  our   engineering
manufacturing  and  marketing  capabilities  and  continue to improve  customer
service and support in order to remain competitive while we expect to undertake
the investment  and effort in each of these areas  we cannot assure you that we
will be able to maintain or improve our  competitive  position  our competitors
may have  greater  financial  engineering  manufacturing  marketing  or other
support resources  market  consolidation may also create additional or stronger
competitors and may intensify competition

we may experience  difficulties in obtaining or protecting intellectual property
rights

we may encounter  difficulties  costs or risks in protecting  our  intellectual
property  rights or  obtaining  rights to  additional  intellectual  property to
permit us to continue or expand our businesses other companies  including some
of our large  competitors  hold patents in our industries and are  aggressively
seeking to expand their patent portfolios  the intellectual  property rights of
others  could  inhibit our  ability to  introduce  new  products in our field of
operations  unless we secure licenses on commercially  reasonable terms we are
and  may  in  the  future  be  subject  to  claims  of  intellectual   property
infringement  from time to time and we cannot  assure  you as to the  outcome of
such claims

we face risks related to our international operations and sales

we have  customers  located  outside the united  states  as well as significant
foreign  operations  including  manufacturing  and sales  as a result of these
international operations we face a number of risks including

    the difficulty of effectively managing our diverse global operations

                                       5

    change in regulatory requirements

    tariffs and other trade barriers

    political and economic instability in foreign markets and

    fluctuations  in  foreign  currencies  which  may  make our  products  less
     competitive  in  countries  in  which  local  currencies  decline  in value
     relative to the dollar

if we fail to attract and retain key  personnel  our results of operations  and
financial performance may suffer

our future  success  will be  determined  in part by our  ability to attract and
retain  in the current  business  environment  key  scientific  and  technical
personnel for our research  development and engineering  efforts  our business
also depends on the continued  contributions of our executive officers and other
key  management  and  technical  personnel  a key to  attracting  and retaining
qualified  employees is our ability to provide employees with the opportunity to
participate  in the  potential  growth of our business  through such programs as
stock  option  plans and employee  investment  plans  the value of which may be
adversely  affected by the  discontinuation  of the payment of  dividends on our
common stock negative stock price performance or stock price volatility we may
also find it more difficult to attract or retain qualified  employees due to our
recent  reductions  in the  workforce  while  we  believe  that  we  have  been
successful in attracting and retaining key personnel  we cannot assure you that
we will continue to be successful in the future

if we provide customer  financing in the future  it could expose us to the term
credit quality of our customers

we  currently  do not  provide  customer  financing  however  the  competitive
environment  in which we  operate  may  require us to  provide  mediumterm  and
longterm  customer  financing in the future if we do so we will be exposed to
the term credit quality of our customers  in the event of economic uncertainty
or reduced  demand for customer  financings in the capital and bank markets  we
may be  required to continue to hold some  customer  financing  obligations  for
longer periods prior to placement with thirdparty lenders

acts of  terrorism  or war and any  military or economic  response by the united
states may harm our financial condition or results of operations

our financial  condition or results of operations  may be adversely  affected by
acts of terrorism  military or economic actions taken in response or to prevent
similar acts of terrorism  or any negative impacts on the economy of terrorists
acts or military responses

current or future  litigation  may harm our  financial  condition  or results of
operations

pending  threatened or future litigation is subject to inherent  uncertainties
our financial  condition or results of operations  may be adversely  affected by
unfavorable outcomes expenses and costs exceeding amounts estimated or insured

our quarterly results may fluctuate

we expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in our quarterly results  all
of the concerns we have  discussed  under risk factors in this form 10k could
affect our operating results in addition our operating results may be affected
by

    seasonality

    the timing of the receipt of product  orders from a limited number of major
     customers

    the announcement and introduction of new products by us

    expenses associated with litigation and

    the costs associated with the acquisition or disposition of a business

our  common  stock  price  has   experienced  and  may  continue  to  experience
substantial volatility

the market price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be
highly volatile because of the following factors

    fluctuations in our quarterly results

    announcements by our competitors and customers of technological innovations
     or new products

    developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights and

    general market conditions

in addition  changes in the markets valuation of telecommunications  equipment
stocks  and in particular those that participate in supplying optical fiber and
photonic  products  could cause our common stock to be volatile or decline from
current levels  the stock market has from time to time experienced  significant
price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of
particular  companies  which fluctuation may also cause the price of our common
stock to decline

our results of operations and financial  performance in future  quarters may not
meet the expectations of public market  securities  analysts and investors  and
that could cause significant volatility in the price of our common stock

during 2001  corning undertook a restructuring  program that closed seven major
manufacturing  facilities and consolidated  certain smaller  facilities  in the
opinion of  management  cornings  facilities are now suitable and adequate for
production and  distribution  of the companys  products based upon the level of
demand we anticipate in 2002 at december 31 2001 corning was not productively
utilizing a significant portion of space in the facilities  due to the slowdown
in the  telecommunications  industry  which lowered the demand for premium fiber
products  the  company  temporarily  idled  most  of  its  fiber  manufacturing
facilities and slowed cable manufacturing in the fourth quarter



item 3  legal proceedings


environmental litigation corning has been named by the environmental protection
agency under the  superfund  act or by state  governments  under  similar state
laws as a potentially  responsible  party at 12 active  hazardous  waste sites
under the  superfund  act all parties who may have  contributed  any waste to a
hazardous  waste site  identified  by such  agency  are jointly and  severally
liable  for the cost of  cleanup  unless  the  agency  agrees  otherwise  it is
cornings  policy to accrue for its  estimated  liability  related to  superfund
sites and other  environmental  liabilities related to property owned by corning
based on expert analysis and continual  monitoring by both internal and external
consultants  corning has accrued  approximately  24 million for its  estimated
liability for  environmental  cleanup and litigation at december 31 2001 based
upon the  information  developed to date  management  believes that the accrued
reserve is a reasonable  estimate of the companys  estimated liability and that
the risk of an additional loss in an amount  materially higher than that accrued
is remote

dow corning bankruptcy corning and the dow chemical company each own 50 of the
common stock of dow corning  corporation  on may 15 1995  dow corning  sought
protection  under the  reorganization  provisions  of  chapter  11 of the united
states  bankruptcy  code and  thereby  obtained a stay of  approximately  19000
breastimplant  product liability lawsuits on november 8 1998 dow corning and
the tort  claimants  committee  jointly  filed a revised plan of  reorganization
joint plan which was confirmed by the  bankruptcy  court on november 30 1999
on december 21 1999 the  bankruptcy  court issued an opinion that approved the
principal  elements  of the  joint  plan with  respect  to tort  claimants  but
construed  the joint plan as  providing  releases for third  parties  including
corning and dow chemical as  shareholders  only with respect to tort  claimants
who voted in favor of the joint plan on november 13 2000  the district  court
entered an order reversing the bankruptcy  courts december 21 1999 opinion on
the release and  injunction  provisions and confirmed the joint plan on october
23 2001  the us  court of appeals for the sixth circuit heard oral arguments
on appeals  taken by foreign  claimants  the us  government  and certain tort
claimants from various  portions of the district  courts order  on january 29
2002 the sixth circuit affirmed the  determinations  made in the district court
with respect to the foreign  claimants  but remanded to the district  court for
further  proceedings  with  respect  to the  claims of the us  government  for
recovery of medical  expenses paid on behalf of tort  claimants and with respect
to the findings  supporting  the  nondebtor  releases in favor of dow cornings
shareholders  and insurers  as a result of the remand  there may be additional
hearings  in the  district  court  the timing and scope of the  proceedings  on
remand are not known at this  point  and the sixth  circuits  ruling adds some
uncertainty with respect to the ultimate  confirmation of the joint plan if the
joint  plan is upheld  but the  shareholder  releases  are not given  their full
effect  corning would expect to defend any remaining claims against it and any
new  claims on the same  grounds  that led to a series of orders and  judgments
dismissing  all claims  against  corning in the federal courts and in many state
courts  as  described  under  the  heading  implant  tort  lawsuits  immediately
hereafter  management  believes that the claims against  corning lack merit and
that the breast  implant  litigation  against  corning will be resolved  without
material impact on cornings financial statements

under the terms of the joint plan  dow corning would be required to establish a
settlement trust and a litigation facility to provide a means for tort claimants
to settle or litigate  their claims  dow corning  would have the  obligation to
fund the trust and the facility  over a period of up to 16 years  in an amount
up to  approximately  33  billion  subject  to  the  limitations  terms  and
conditions  stated in the joint plan  corning and dow chemical have each agreed
to provide a credit  facility to dow corning of up to 150 million 300 million
in the aggregate subject to the terms and conditions stated in the joint plan
the joint plan also provides for dow corning to make full payment  through cash
and the issuance of senior notes  to its commercial  creditors  the commercial
creditors have contested the bankruptcy courts disallowance of their claims for
postpetition  interest at default  rates of interest  and have appealed to the
district  court  while the  amounts at issue on this  appeal  are  subject to a
variety of  contingencies  it is possible that the aggregate claim exceeds 100
million  dow  corning is  vigorously  contesting  the  appeal  if and when dow
corning  emerges from  bankruptcy  corning expects to resume the recognition of
equity earnings from dow corning  corning does not expect to receive  dividends
from dow corning in the foreseeable future

appeals for the eleventh  circuit  dismissed  the  plaintiffs  appeal from that
judgment  in state court  legislation  corning was awarded summary judgment in

crossclaim  by dow  chemical on february 21  1997  on february 11 1998  the
intermediate appeals court in louisiana vacated this judgment as premature  the
louisiana  cases were  transferred  to the united states  district court for the
eastern  district of michigan  southern  division  michigan  federal court to
which  substantially  all breast implant cases were  transferred in 1997 in the
michigan  federal  court  corning is named as a defendant in  approximately  70
pending cases including some cases with multiple claimants in addition to the
transferred  louisiana  cases the michigan federal court heard cornings motion
for summary  judgment on february  27 1998  but has not ruled  based upon the
information  developed  to date and  recognizing  that the  outcome  of  complex
litigation  is  uncertain  management  believes  that the risk of a  materially
adverse result in the implant  litigation against corning is remote and believes
the implant  litigation against corning will be resolved without material impact
on cornings financial statements

federal securities cases a federal securities class action lawsuit was filed in
1992 against corning and certain individual  defendants by a class of purchasers
of corning stock who allege  misrepresentations  and omissions of material facts
relative to the silicone gel breast implant  business  conducted by dow corning
this  action is pending in the united  states  district  court for the  southern
district of new york the class consists of those purchasers of corning stock in
the period from june 14 1989 to january 13 1992  who allegedly  purchased at
inflated prices due to the nondisclosure or concealment of material information
and were damaged when  cornings  stock price declined in january 1992 after the
food and drug administration  fda requested a moratorium on dow cornings sale
of silicone gel implants no amount of damages is specified in the complaint in
1997 the court  dismissed the individual  defendants from the case in december
1998  corning filed a motion for summary  judgment  requesting  that all claims
against  it  be  dismissed   plaintiffs   requested  the  opportunity  to  take
depositions before responding to the motion for summary judgment  the discovery
process is  continuing  and the court has set no  schedule  to address the still
pending  summary  judgment  motion  corning  intends to continue to defend this
action vigorously  based upon the information developed to date and recognizing
that the  outcome of  litigation  is  uncertain  management  believes  that the
likelihood of a materially adverse verdict is remote

directors were named defendants and served in four different  lawsuits  alleging
violations of the us  securities  laws in connection  with cornings  november

status  corning  has not yet  answered  these  lawsuits  and  there has been no
determination if they will proceed as a class action or who will be lead counsel
for plaintiffs  management is prepared to defend these lawsuits vigorously and
recognizing that the outcome of litigation is uncertain  believes it has strong
defenses to the claims alleged in the complaints

alleged patent  infringement of two patents  relating to the properties of fused
silica materials used in the optical  components of stepper machines  the suits
request  damages and an injunction  preventing  sales of infringing  products in

pittsburgh corning corporation corning and ppg industries inc each own 50 of
the capital stock of pittsburgh corning corporation pcc pcc and several other
defendants  have been  named in  numerous  lawsuits  involving  claims  alleging
personal  injury from  exposure to asbestos  on april 16  2000  pcc filed for
chapter 11  reorganization in the united states bankruptcy court for the western
district of  pennsylvania  as of the  bankruptcy  filing  pcc had in excess of
140000  open  claims  and now has in  excess of  240000  open  claims  in the
bankruptcy court pcc obtained a preliminary  injunction against the prosecution
of asbestos  actions against its two shareholders to afford the parties a period
of time the injunction  period in which to negotiate a plan of  reorganization
for pcc the injunction period has been extended until april 15 2002 under the
terms of the bankruptcy courts order pcc ppg industries and corning will have
90 days  following  expiration  of the  injunction  period to seek  removal  and
transfer  of  stayed  cases  that  have  not  been  resolved  through  a plan of
reorganization  as a result of pccs  bankruptcy  filing  corning  recorded an
aftertax  charge of 36  million  in the first  quarter  of 2000 to impair  its
entire investment in pcc and discontinued recognition of equity earnings at the
time pcc filed for bankruptcy protection there were approximately 12400 claims
pending against corning alleging various theories of liability based on exposure
to  pccs  asbestos  products  although  the  outcome  of  litigation  and  the
bankruptcy case is uncertain  management  believes that the separate  corporate
status  of  pcc  will  continue  to  be  upheld  management  is  continuing  to
investigate  cornings  options for  defending  claims  against it  which might
include  vigorously  defending  itself  on all  fronts  or  exploring  a global
settlement  through the  bankruptcy  process  it is probable that there will be
intensive  negotiations  throughout the first half of 2002  concerning  terms of
pccs plan of reorganization  including whether or not corning and its insurers
may participate by making a contribution  in exchange for a release  management
cannot  estimate  the  probability  that  corning  will be able to secure such a
release upon terms and conditions  satisfactory to corning and its insurers the
range of cost for these options net of  insurance  cannot be estimated at this
time  corning is named in  approximately  14000 other cases alleging  injuries
from  asbestos and those cases have been covered by insurance  without  material
impact to corning to date although asbestos litigation is inherently difficult
and the outcome of litigation is uncertain  management  believes  these matters
will be resolved  without a materially  adverse  impact on  cornings  financial
position  if corning and its insurers agree to a global settlement  through the
bankruptcy process such outcome may be material to the results of operations of
the period in which such costs if any are recognized

item 7 managements  discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations


cornings  financial  results in 2001  deteriorated  significantly  from 2000 as
capital spending in the telecommunications  industry diminished  the demand for
premium fiber  declined  considerably  in the second quarter and the downturn in
the us  economy  in the latter  half of the year  negatively  impacted  all of
cornings  businesses  as a  result  sales and  earnings  fell in all three of
cornings  operating  segments  corning impaired  goodwill and other intangible
assets in its photonic technologies business totaling approximately 48 billion
and recorded  333 million to  writedown  excess and obsolete  inventory  as a
result of the declining  performance and  expectations  management took several
steps  throughout the year to reduce its cost structure  those actions included
the following

    incurred  pretax  charges  of 961  million  related  to actions to reduce
     overall  headcount by approximately  12000 employees and impair longlived
     assets  including  the  closing of seven  major  plants  primarily  in the
     telecommunications and advanced materials segments
    idled fiber manufacturing facilities for most of the fourth quarter and
    reduced capital expenditures in 2001 from the originally planned investment
     of 25 billion to 18 billion and lowered the capital  budget for 2002 to
     under 500 million

results of operations

consolidated  net sales for 2001 were 63  billion  a 12 decrease  from 2000
excluding  the  impact of  acquisitions  cornings  consolidated  sales in 2001
decreased  16  compared  to  2000  sales  declines  for 2001  occurred  in all
operating segments but were most pronounced in the  telecommunications  segment
where  sales  fell 14  consolidated  sales for 2000 were 71  billion  a 50
increase over 1999 sales of 47 billion excluding acquisitions  sales in 2000
increased 36 over 1999

in 2001 corning incurred a loss from continuing  operations of 55 billion or
589 per  share  compared  with  income  from  continuing  operations  of 409
million  or 046 per share in 2000 and income from  continuing  operations of
511 million or 065 per share in 1999

the 2001 loss is largely  attributable to a charge of approximately 48 billion
47 billion  aftertax in the second  quarter to impair  goodwill and certain
other intangible assets of the photonic technologies business cornings results
for the year were also  impacted  by charges for  restructuring  actions of 961
million 590 million  aftertax and minority  interest which included  charges
for headcount  reductions  exit costs and  impairment  of plant and  equipment
further  discussion  of these  charges  begins under  impairment of goodwill and
other  intangible  assets  restructuring  actions  and  notes  4 and  5 to  the
consolidated financial statements  corning recorded an operating charge of 273
million 184 million  aftertax in the second quarter to writedown excess and
obsolete inventory  primarily in the photonic  technologies  business  corning
recorded operating charges totaling 178 million 109 million aftertax in the
fourth quarter for the following

    90  million  related to the release of  restrictions  on shares of corning
     common stock held by employees
    60 million to  writedown  excess and  obsolete  inventory in the photonic
     technologies business and
    28 million to writedown an investment in intellectual property

                                       12

income and earnings per share from continuing  operations  declined 20 and 29
respectively  between  2000  and 1999  primarily  due to  substantial  noncash
acquisitionrelated  charges  incurred in 2000  the charges  included gains and
losses on the disposition and restructuring of businesses  purchased inprocess
research and development iprd charges other  acquisitionrelated  charges and
impairment losses in addition as a result of its acquisition strategy corning
began to record significant amounts of amortization of purchased intangibles and
goodwill  in 2000  these  amounts  increased  in 2001  despite  the  impairment
charges see nonsegment results for a discussion of these items

corning believes a better  understanding of the changes in its operating results
is provided by comparing  its  operating  results on a pro forma basis  corning
retroactively  changed  its  definition  of pro forma net  income in the  fourth
quarter of 2001 to include the  amortization  of  purchased  intangibles  in the
calculation  of pro forma net income and pro forma  diluted  earnings per share
pro forma  results for 2000 and 1999 have been  restated  for the change and are
presented  below  pro forma net income excludes  impairment and amortization of
goodwill   impairment  of  other  intangible  assets   restructuring  actions
purchased  iprd  charges   onetime   acquisitionrelated   charges  and  other
nonrecurring  items  this measure is not in accordance  with or an alternative
for  accounting  principles  generally accepted in the united states of america
gaap and may not be  consistent  with  measures  used by other  companies  it
should be considered supplemental data

pro forma  net  income in 2001  totaled  157  million  or 017 per  share  a
decrease of 85 and 86  respectively  from 2000 pro forma net income in 2000
was 11 billion or 122 per share an increase of 106 and 83 respectively
over 1999  corning  calculates  pro forma net income  from  loss  income from
continuing operations as follows aftertax and minority interest in millions

the  decrease in pro forma net income in 2001 was  primarily  due to lower sales
volumes  charges for  inventory  writedowns  and stock  compensation  charges
cornings results for 2001 weakened  significantly  over the course of the year
quarterly  revenues  and  pro  forma  net  income  loss  were as  follows  in

pro forma net income loss         268        74          76      261

the  first  half of the year was  impacted  as  capital  spending  in the  north
american  longhaul sector declined  thus lowering demand for premium fiber and
photonic products used in new networks  the situation  intensified in the third
quarter as carriers in north america and other regions began to delay  purchases
of singlemode fiber particularly in september  finally  cornings businesses
in advanced  materials  and  information  display  also began  experiencing  the
effects of a slowing us  economy as the events of september 11th disrupted the
markets and the economy even further

outlook

corning  believes  that  2002  will  be a  very  challenging  year  as  industry
conditions  experienced in the second half of 2001 extend into 2002  management
expects  first  quarter  revenues  to  approximate  the fourth  quarter of 2001
management  does not expect recovery to begin until late 2002 or early 2003 as
a result  management  expects  sales for 2002 to be  significantly  below  2001
levels and anticipates  corning will continue to incur losses in the shortterm
corning  expects to realize  cost savings from  restructuring  actions  taken in
2001 however  these improvements may be offset by pricing pressures in several
key businesses

management  believes  corning has ample  liquidity to meet its funding needs for
2002  corning  finished  the year  with  22  billion  in cash and  shortterm
investments   and  an  unused   revolving   credit  facility  of  20  billion
managements  focus in 2002 will be to reduce  cornings  cash  requirements  to
manageable levels and restore its operations to profitability

cornings  longterm strategy remains  unchanged  corning will continue to make
significant  investments in research and  development  for all segments and will
invest  in  the  expansion  of the  liquid  crystal  display  business  and  the
development of diesel substrates during this industry downturn

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets

during the first half of 2001 corning experienced a significant decrease in the
rate of growth of its  telecommunications  segment  primarily  in the  photonic
technologies business  due to a dramatic decline in infrastructure  spending in
the telecommunications  industry  during the second quarter major customers in
the photonic  technologies  business  reduced their order forecasts and canceled
orders  already  placed  as a result  management  determined  that the  growth
prospects of this business were significantly less than previously  expected and
those of historical periods

corning reviews the recoverability of its longlived assets  including goodwill
and other intangible assets  when events or changes in circumstances occur that
indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable  as a result of
the business  conditions noted above  corning  concluded such an assessment was
required for its photonic technologies  business in the second quarter  corning
assesses  recoverability  of the carrying value based upon  cumulative  expected
future pretax cash flows  undiscounted  and without  interest  charges of the
related operations

as a  result  of this  test  corning  determined  that the  longlived  assets
including goodwill and other intangibles acquired from pirelli in december 2000
as well as those of the unit into which  netoptix  corporation  acquired in may
2000  had  been  integrated  were  not  recoverable  cornings  policy  is to
writedown longlived assets to fair value in such circumstances

management  estimated  fair value using  several  techniques  while each method
generated  comparable fair values  management  adjusted the assets to estimates
based on average  multiples of  forecasted  revenues and earnings of  comparable
publicly  traded  companies  with  operations  in the optical  component  market
segment

in the second  quarter  corning  recorded  pretax charges of 4648 million to
impair a  significant  portion of  goodwill  and 116  million  to impair  other
intangible assets of the total charge of 4764 million 3154 million related
to the acquisition of the pirelli optical  components and devices  business the
pirelli  transaction and 1610 million related to goodwill  resulting from the
acquisition of netoptix corporation

restructuring actions

corning has approved and executed several  restructuring  actions throughout the
year these actions and the charges relating to them are described below

in the first quarter of 2001  corning  reduced its  workforce by  approximately
3300  positions  primarily  in the  photonic  technologies  and  hardware  and
equipment   businesses   these  workforce  reductions  included  mostly  hourly
production  workers and resulted in minimal  severance  charges  in april 2001
corning  completed an  additional  workforce  reduction of  approximately  1000
positions  in  photonic   technologies   including  both  hourly  and  salaried
employees  the second quarter reductions resulted in a restructuring  charge of
8 million 5 million aftertax

                                       14

in the third quarter of 2001  additional  actions were approved and undertaken
primarily in the telecommunications segment which included the following

    closure of three  manufacturing  facilities  in the  photonic  technologies
     business resulting in the elimination of approximately 800 positions and
    elimination of approximately 2900 positions worldwide in the optical fiber
     and cable  business  this  action  included a voluntary  early  retirement
     program for certain employees along with involuntary separations

as a result of these  actions  corning  recorded a total charge of 339 million
222 million  aftertax which included a restructuring  charge of 103 million
and a charge to impair plant and equipment of 236 million in the third quarter
the restructuring  charge included 6 million for net pension and postretirement
benefit curtailment charges

in  response  to the  continued  deteriorating  business  condition  management
approved and recorded the following restructuring actions in the fourth quarter

    closure or  consolidation  of several  manufacturing  locations  as well as
     smaller businesses across all operating segments
    discontinuation  of  its  initiative  in  corning   microarray   technology
     products part of cornings life sciences business and
    further  headcount  reduction of  approximately  4000 positions across all
     businesses  research and staff organizations  this action also included a
     selective  voluntary early retirement  program for certain  employees along
     with involuntary separations

as a result of actions taken in the fourth quarter corning recorded a charge in
the quarter of 614 million 363 million aftertax and minority interest which
included a restructuring charge of 308 million and a charge to impair plant and
equipment of 306 million  the  restructuring  charge  included 35 million for
pension and postretirement  termination benefits and 25 million for net pension
and postretirement benefit curtailment charges

the  carrying  value of a  longlived  asset  is  considered  impaired  when the
expected  separately  identifiable  undiscounted  cash flows from that asset are
less  than  the  carrying  value  of the  asset  the  impairment  charges  were
determined  based on the amount by which the  carrying  value  exceeded the fair
market value of the asset

a significant portion of the assets impaired was recently acquired  or built in
connection with capacity  expansions in  anticipation of future demand  most of
the  impaired  facilities  are  currently  available  for sale  others  will be
demolished  the impaired equipment will be auctioned  sold or disposed during
2002

the facilities  closed in the year primarily relate to the photonics and optical
fiber and cable  businesses  that corning is not exiting  the operations  being
exited comprise the majority of the lighting business of the advanced  materials
segment  this  business is not  material  to  cornings  revenues or  financial
results

in summary  cornings  restructuring  actions  totaled  961 million in pretax
charges for the year ended  december 31 2001  of which 95 million  related to
exit costs primarily for lease  termination and contract  cancellation  charges
approximately one third of this total charge is expected to be paid in cash the
total number of positions  eliminated was  approximately  12000 as of december
31 2001  approximately 10100 of the 12000 employees had been separated under
the plans  corning  expects to realize  savings of  approximately  400 million
annually  beginning  in 2002 as a result  of these  restructuring  actions  the
savings  are  expected  to be  realized  primarily  in cost of sales and also in
selling  general and  administrative  expenses and  research  development  and
engineering expenses

noncash  charges for employee  related  costs were 66 million with 35 million
for  pension and  postretirement  termination  benefits  and 31 million for net
pension and postretirement benefit curtailment charges curtailment charges were
recorded primarily due to the decrease in expected future years of service  the

of equity  affiliates  that are  closely  associated  with  cornings  operating
segments in segment net income  corning retroactively changed its definition of
segment net income in the fourth quarter of 2001 to include the  amortization of
purchased  intangibles  in addition  during the quarter  ended march 31  2001
corning realigned one product line from the advanced  materials segment into the

corning  prepared the financial  results for its three  operating  segments on a
basis that is consistent with the manner in which corning management  internally
disaggregates  financial  information  to assist in  making  internal  operating
decisions   corning  has  allocated  certain  common  expenses  among  segments
differently  than it would for stand  alone  financial  information  prepared in
accordance  with gaap  the  nonrecurring  items noted above are  excluded  from
segment net income but are described more fully in nonsegment results

the  telecommunications  segment  produces  optical  fiber  and  cable  optical
hardware and equipment  photonic modules and components and optical  networking
devices for the worldwide telecommunications industry

2001 vs 2000

sales in the telecommunications segment decreased 14 from 2000 to 45 billion
excluding the impact of acquisitions the sales decline was 19 the decrease in
sales was primarily due to sales volume decreases in most businesses  throughout
the segment as capital  spending in the  telecommunications  industry  decreased
significantly  segment net income fell precipitously  compared to 2000s strong
results  as net income in the  optical  fiber and cable  business  was more than
offset by losses in all other  businesses  the loss of sales  volume in premium
fiber and  photonic  products  reduced  gross  margins and the segment  incurred
operating  charges totaling 333 million 221 million  aftertax to writedown
excess and obsolete inventory including estimated purchase commitments further
lowering gross margin percentages

sales in the  optical  fiber and cable  business in 2001  remained  flat at 29
billion compared with 2000 although sales declined  significantly in the fourth
quarter  of 2001  excluding  the  impact of  acquisitions  sales  declined  4
compared  to 2000  the lack of growth  reflects  the loss of volume in  premium
products  beginning in the second quarter due to the decline in longhaul demand
as capital spending for network  buildouts  diminished and the business began to
experience  volume decreases in sales of singlemode fiber in the third quarter
as a result  most  fiber  manufacturing  facilities  were  idled in the  fourth
quarter  overall  fiber and cable volume decreased  approximately  15 for the
year as a result of an  increase of  approximately  30 in the first half of the
year  offset  by a  decrease  of  approximately  50 in  the  second  half  the
weightedaverage  price for cornings  optical fiber and cable products remained
relatively stable compared to 2000 as higher prices were offset by significantly
decreased volumes for premium  products  premium fiber as a percentage of total
fiber demand was approximately 20 in 2001

net income for the optical fiber and cable  business  decreased over 5 compared
to 2000 as the loss of sales volume in premium  products was partially offset by
increased  sales of lower margin  singlemode  products  in response to reduced
demand for fiber  products  corning  announced  it will  permanently  close its
optical fiber operations in deeside  north wales and its cabling  operations in
saskatoon  canada in  addition to  temporarily  ceasing  production  at smaller
cabling facilities

sales  in the  hardware  and  equipment  business  declined  20 in 2001 to 817
million compared to 102 billion in 2000 excluding the impact of acquisitions
sales declined 28 compared to 2000 the decrease was due to lower sales volumes
as capital spending in the cable  television  industry fell  significantly  from
prior year levels  business performance decreased significantly to a small loss
in 2001 due to  considerably  lower sales  volumes  this  business  reduced its
headcount during the year and closed a small manufacturing facility

the photonic  technologies business manufactures photonic modules and components
primarily  for  the  optical   amplification   market  sales  in  the  photonic
technologies  business  declined  over 50 to 462 million  compared  with 104
billion in 2000 the sales decrease reflects significant declines in orders from
major   customers   caused  by  the   decrease   in  capital   spending  in  the
telecommunications  industry the business incurred a significant operating loss
for the year as a result of lower sales volumes excess capacity a higher fixed
cost  structure and charges for excess and obsolete  inventory in the second and
fourth quarters

during the second quarter major customers in the photonic technologies business
reduced their order forecasts and cancelled orders already placed  as a result
management  determined that certain products were not likely to be sold in their
product life cycle  corning recorded a charge to writedown excess and obsolete
inventory  including  estimated  purchase  commitments  of 273 million  184
million  aftertax in cost of sales in the second quarter of 2001 the business
recorded an  additional  charge of 60 million  37 million  aftertax  in the
fourth quarter as a result of lower revenue forecasts for 2002

corning  has  or is in the  process  of  disposing  all such  inventory  except
approximately  100 million  corning has retained and isolated this  inventory
and in the unlikely event that product is sold  corning will fully disclose the
impact on its margins

corning announced a downsizing of the photonic  technologies business and closed
the following three manufacturing facilities in 2001

    benton park facility in benton township pa
    corning lasertrons facility in nashua nh and
    monroe park manufacturing and development operations in henrietta ny

in addition  corning scaled back its photonic technologies  operations in erwin
park  ny  and  the   remainder  of  its  photonic   facilities  to  adjust  its
manufacturing  capacity levels and headcount to lower revenue expectations  the
business reduced its headcount  approximately 75 from peak employment levels in
2001

the controls and connectors business manufactures control systems  switches and
encoders  sales in this business decreased 15 to 205 million in 2001 compared
to 241  million in 2000  lower  sales  volume was the  primary  reason for the
decline due to the weak us  economy  the business  incurred an  insignificant
loss  for the  year  compared  to an  insignificant  profit  in 2000  due to the
depressed volume

the optical networking business manufactures  wavelength management products and
optical switch modules the business began shipping products to customers in the
third quarter of 2000  sales for 2001 were 38 million and comprised  mostly of
dynamic  spectral  equalizers  compared to partial year sales of 11 million in
2000  the loss in 2001 was greater than 2000  primarily  due to the 28 million
pretax  writedown  of an  investment in  intellectual  property  in addition
volumes were lower than expected and development spending increased

sales to cornings  largest  customer in 2001 were under 10 of consolidated and
telecommunications segment sales

2000 vs 1999

sales in the telecommunications segment increased 74 over 1999 to 52 billion
excluding the impact of acquisitions  sales growth was 50 the sales growth in
the segment was led  primarily  by volume  gains in the optical  fiber and cable
business  hardware and equipment and photonic technologies businesses  segment
net income more than doubled in 2000 compared to 1999 the  percentage  increase
in segment net income  exceeded  the  increase in sales  reflecting  an overall
increase  in  segment  gross  margin  percentage  and a  decrease  in  research
development and engineering as a percentage of sales

sales in the optical fiber and cable  business in 2000  increased  approximately
70 over 1999 to  approximately  29  billion  the increase in sales  resulted
chiefly  from the impact of  acquisitions  and strong  volume  gains for leafr
optical  fiber  volume  growth  continued to be driven by  regional  local and
longhaul  telephone  companies  and  cable  television   operators   including
significant  european  carriers  benefiting  from continued  deregulation of the
telecommunications industry throughout europe approximately 460 million of the
increase in optical fiber and cable sales primarily  resulted from the following
acquisitions

    the  acquisition  of the  remaining  50  interest  in siecor  gmbh and the
     cabling business  previously owned by siemens in the first quarter of 2000
     and
    the  acquisition  of the  optical  cable  business  from bicc  plc and the
     remaining 50 interest in optical  waveguides  australia  pty ltd in the
     second quarter of 1999

excluding the impact of these acquisitions sales in the optical fiber and cable
business  increased  42 for the year  principally  due to sales volume gains of
almost 50  reflecting  continued  strong  demand for  cornings  premium fiber
products  volume of premium fiber and cable products  including cornings leaf
optical  fiber  more than doubled over the same period in 1999  price declines
ranged  between 5 and 10 for  cornings  optical  fiber and cable  products in
comparison with last year the weightedaverage optical fiber and cable price in
2000 remained relatively stable compared to 1999 the rate of price declines for
cabled  products  slowed   throughout  2000   commensurate  with  the  worldwide
tightening of optical fiber supply

net income from the optical fiber and cable business increased approximately 84
in 2000  compared  to 1999  the strong  earnings  performance  is due to volume
growth in highdata  rate products  relatively  stable pricing and a shift to a
higher premium product mix

sales in the  telecommunications  hardware and equipment business increased over
82 in 2000 to approximately 102 billion this increase resulted from a higher
sales volume of existing  products  the siemens  transaction  and  particularly
strong demand from cable television customers offset in part by price declines
excluding the impact of acquisitions sales increased 57 over 1999 overall net
income almost doubled over 1999 largely due to sales volume increases

sales in the  photonic  technologies  business  more than  doubled  over 1999 to
approximately  10 billion  the business realized strong sales volume gains in
2000 led by new product sales  growth in amplifier sales and acquisitions  the
operating  performance in this business  improved in 2000 as the business became
solidly  profitable  due to  strong  volume  productivity  gains  and more cost
efficient  access to pump lasers achieved  through the acquisition of lasertron
corning  continued  to  invest  heavily  in  research  and  development  in this
business

sales in the  controls and  connectors  business  increased  14 in 2000 to 241
million net income from this business improved slightly  moving from breakeven
in  1999  to  modest  profitability  in  2000  primarily  due to  sales  volume
increases

during  the  third  quarter  of 2000  the  optical  networking  business  began
shipments of its  wavelength  management  products to customers  sales for 2000
were 11 million  this business operated at a loss due to significant  research
and development investments

sales to cornings  largest  customer  accounted  for  approximately  12 of the
telecommunications  segment sales in 2000  including a  significant  portion of
total sales in the photonic technologies business but under 10 of consolidated
sales

outlook  management  believes  the weak  conditions  in the  telecommunications
industry  experienced in the second part of 2001 will continue into 2002  first
quarter sales are expected to approximate  fourth quarter 2001 levels  however
losses are expected to decrease somewhat due to restructuring  actions taken and
the absence of nonrecurring charges

management does not expect a recovery in this industry until late 2002 or early
2003 corning  anticipates that recovery in this segment is dependent on capital
spending by network operators and cable television entities as they add fiber to
metro access  networks in the us and on the level of demand in  international
markets  as the industry  currently  has  significant  excess  capacity  price
pressure is expected to continue throughout 2002

2001 vs 2000

sales in 2001 for the advanced  materials  segment  decreased 3 to 993 million
compared  to  sales  of  102   billion  in  2000   excluding  the  impact  of
acquisitions  sales declined 5 sales increases in the life sciences  business
were  more  than  offset  by  declines  in the  environmental  technologies  and
semiconductor materials businesses  segment net income also declined in 2001 as
the segment  recorded net income of 46 million  compared to 80 million in 2000
for a 43  decrease  the decline in  profitability  was primarily due to weaker
performance  by  the  environmental  technologies  and  semiconductor  materials
businesses  partially  offset  by  improved  performance  by the  life  sciences
business

sales in the environmental  technologies  business  the largest business in the
segment and a manufacturer of catalytic  converter  substrates  decreased 8 in
2001 to 379 million  the business  experienced lower sales volumes compared to
2000 due to decreased  vehicle  production  volume growth in asia was more than
offset by declining  volumes in north america and europe  earnings for the year
were  down  almost  50  primarily  due to lower  sales  volumes  manufacturing
inefficiencies  related to the  introduction  of new ultra  thin wall  products
excess capacity and startup costs in south africa and china

in october 2001 corning announced the approval of a new diesel emission control
product manufacturing  facility the new plant will be located in erwin ny with
construction  to begin in 2002  initial  production  of  substrate  and  filter
products is expected in early 2004

sales in the life  sciences  business  a supplier of advanced  microplates  and
other  laboratory  products  increased  8  over  2000  to  267  million  the
improvement  was primarily  due to an increase in sales volume  earnings in the
base business almost doubled over 2000 primarily due to a shift to higher margin
products  in sales  mix  along  with  improvements  in  manufacturing  costs and
selling general and administrative  expenses  overall earnings in the business
were  diluted due to the  investment  in  microarray  technology  which  corning
discontinued at the end of 2001

sales in cornings other advanced materials businesses  including semiconductor
materials  and  ophthalmic  products  decreased  4 in 2001  to  347  million
excluding the  acquisition  of tropel in march 2001  sales  decreased  11 the
decrease  was due to softness  in the market for  ophthalmic  products  and high
purity fused silica earnings for the year were approximately breakeven and down
slightly  compared to 2000  lower sales volumes and  production  slowdowns were
partially  offset by a marginal  increase in equity  earnings from  eurokera  a
french based  manufacturer  of glass ceramic  cooktops  resulting in comparable
earnings between years corning plans to exit the lighting and tubing businesses
in  2002  and  has  announced  the  shutdown  of  manufacturing  facilities  in
greenville oh and corning ny

2000 vs 1999

sales in the advanced materials segment were relatively flat compared to 1999 at
approximately  10  billion   chiefly  due  to  growth  in  the  environmental
technologies  business  which  was  offset  by  a  sales  decline  due  to  the
divestiture  of the quanterra  business in january 2000 and flat  performance in
other advanced  materials  businesses  excluding the impact of the divestiture
sales  improved  6  segment  net  income  declined  17 in  2000  as  earnings
improvements  in other advanced  materials  businesses  were more than offset by
decreased  performance  in  environmental  technologies  and life sciences while
equity earnings remained flat

sales in the environmental  technologies  business increased almost 3 over 1999
to 411 million  the growth in sales  resulted from a strong global auto market
in 2000 and increased market penetration of cornings thinwall products coupled
with increases in the base substrate  business that was partially  offset by the
weak euro  earnings in this business decreased  approximately 12  principally
due to  startup  costs of new  plants in south  africa  and china and  elevated
research and development spending on diesel substrate programs

sales in the  life  sciences  business  of 248  million  were  down  over 6 in
comparison  to 1999 as the business  continued to see a shift in spending in the
pharmaceutical  industry  from  traditional  products to genomics  the business
reported a small loss in 2000 compared to a modest profit in 1999  the loss was
primarily  due to an  increased  commitment  to  research  and  development  and
marketing costs  associated with the launch of cornings  microarray  technology
products  in the third  quarter of 2000  excluding  startup  costs  related to
microarrays earnings were flat compared to 1999

                                       20

page

sales in cornings other advanced  materials  businesses  were relatively  flat
compared to 1999 at approximately 362 million the flat performance was due to
elevated  sales  of high  purity  fused  silica  products  in the  semiconductor
materials  business  which was  offset  by the  impact  of the  divestiture  of
quanterra in january  excluding the  divestiture  of quanterra  sales improved
over 23 earnings from these businesses more than doubled over 1999 due largely
to increased volume and despite flat performances from eurokera and keraglass a
french based manufacturer of glass ceramic cooktops

outlook the environmental technologies businesses experienced slow sales at the
end of 2001 and that trend is expected to continue  into 2002  sales  growth in
environmental  technologies  will be dependent upon an overall economic recovery
in the us as well as europe  evidenced by increased vehicle production  the
life  sciences  business is expected to continue its 2001 growth trends in 2002
the other businesses in this segment  experienced sales declines over the latter
half of the year and that trend is  expected to  continue  into 2002  growth in
other advanced materials businesses will depend on recovery in the semiconductor
materials business and the general economy

flat  panel  displays  display  technologies  glass  panels and  funnels  for
televisions and cathode ray tubes conventional video components and precision
lens assemblies for projection video systems

2001 vs 2000

sales in the information  display segment  decreased 11 in 2001 to 800 million
as sales decreases in the conventional video components and display technologies
businesses more than offset an increase in the precision lens business  segment
net income declined 36 with each business deteriorating compared to 2000

sales in the display technology business a leading supplier of ultrathin glass
substrates  used to produce flat panel display  decreased 3 to 323 million in
2001 a significant  shift in customer  demand from japan to korea caused volume
to increase  approximately  35 at samsung corning  precision glass company ltd
samsung  corning  precision  an equity  affiliate and korean  manufacturer of
liquid crystal display glass and 17 in the consolidated business  this volume
growth when offset by the impact of price declines and the deterioration of the
yen  resulted  in  the  sales  decline  of  3   earnings  for  2001  decreased
approximately  25  primarily due to lower operating  margins driven by pricing
pressures  startup costs  incurred for the may opening of a new  manufacturing
facility in taiwan and  additional  development  and  engineering  expenses  for
eagle2000tm  a new glass  substrate  used in  active  matrix  liquid  crystal
displays additionally equity earnings from samsung corning precision were down
over 15 compared to 2000  primarily due to corning  having a smaller  ownership
interest in the company in 2001 vs 2000

sales in the conventional video components business a manufacturer of optically
pure mechanically precise face plates and funnels for largerscreen  television
tubes were 252 million  down 29 compared to 2000 the decrease was primarily
due to a weak us economy and increased competitive pricing pressure  earnings
were down almost 50 due to lower sales volumes decreased margins a production
slowdown  in the fourth  quarter  and lower  equity  earnings  samsung  corning
company  ltd  samsung  corning  a  manufacturer  based in south  korea  that
produces  glass panels and funnels for  television  and display  monitors  also
experienced lower sales volumes and increased competitive pricing pressure  and
thus lower  earnings  corning owns 50 of samsung corning and accounts for this

sales in the  precision  lens  business  a  manufacturer  of lens  systems  for
projection  video and a  specialist  at making  lenses  from  optical  plastics
increased  9 to 225  million in 2001  the  increase  was due to the growth of
digital  projection  television  in the us and china where the demand for high
definition  television was growing  despite the increase in sales earnings for
2001  decreased  approximately  30  primarily  due to  increased  research  and
development  spending and manufacturing  costs related to capacity  expansion of
projection television assemblies

2000 vs 1999

sales in the information  display segment increased 28 in 2000 to 894 million
primarily due to strong growth in the display  technologies  and precision  lens
businesses  segment  net income  more than  doubled  as did  equity  earnings
reflecting increased earnings in each business over 1999

sales in the conventional video components  business remained relatively flat at
354 million for 2000 compared to 1999 due to slightly lower volumes offset in
part by price  increases  as the supply of  television  glass  began to tighten
earnings in this  business  increased  83  compared to 1999  primarily  due to
higher equity earnings  in addition to cost reductions and the impact of volume
and mix as a shift to higher premium products  occurred in 2000 the increase in
equity earnings reflected improved volume and stable pricing at samsung corning

sales in the display  technologies  business in 2000  increased 76 over 1999 to
333  million  this  significant  increase was the result of  continued  strong
demand for the business  liquid crystal glass for flat panel  displays  led by
increased penetration into the desktop display market earnings in this business
more than doubled  compared to 1999  reflecting  strong volume gains and stable
pricing  also equity earnings from samsung corning  precision more than doubled
largely due to strong volume gains in the korean marketplace

sales in the precision lens business  increased 32 in 2000 to 207 million as a
result of strong volume growth for projection  televisions  driven by demand for
larger size digital television sets in the entertainment market sector earnings
in this  business  increased  59  over  1999  primarily  due to  volume  gains
manufacturing efficiencies and the refocusing of product lines

during the fourth  quarter of 2000  samsung  corning  recognized a nonoperating
gain of 23 million from the  divestment of its 40 interest in samsung  corning
precision  cornings  11 million  share of this gain is excluded  from segment
equity earnings

outlook  management expects the display technologies  business to see growth in
sales  volume in 2002  primarily  due to  increased  penetration  of flat panel
monitors  this  business  will  continue to be impacted by its  exposure to the
exchange  rate of the yen  management  expects the soft  economy to continue to
impact the  conventional  video  components  business  in 2002 as low demand and
overcapacity of glass exert downward pressure on prices in addition changes in
the  competitive  environment in the  conventional  television  glass market may
present  significant  challenges to this business  the projection lens business
anticipates modest growth that will be dependent on global economic recovery

compared to 216 million 202  million  aftertax in 2000 and 24 million 18
million  aftertax in 1999  amortization  of goodwill  increased in 2001 as it
included  charges for the entire year related to transactions  completed late in

income taxes

cornings  effective  benefit tax rate for  continuing  operations was 74
589 and 307 in 2001  2000 and 1999  respectively  the effective tax rates
for the three years are not comparable primarily due to the significant amounts
of amortization of goodwill and other intangible  assets in 2001 and 2000 along
with significant charges for impairment of goodwill in 2001 and iprd in 2000 as
these charges are not tax deductible these items reduce the benefit in 2001 and
increase the expense in 2000 note 8 to the  consolidated  financial  statements
reconciles the statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate

liquidity and capital resources

corning is meeting its  funding  needs  through  operating  cash flows  outside
borrowings and equity issuances  at december 31 2001 corning had 22 billion
in cash and shortterm  investments and an unused  revolving  credit facility of
20 billion

cash flows and working capital

sources of cash flow in 2001 were primarily operations  generating cash of 14
billion  and  financing  transactions  primarily  issuances  of public debt and
equity  securities  providing  cash of 09 billion  corning used cash of 24
billion in investing  activities  primarily  for capital  expenditures  and the
purchase of shortterm investments

cash provided by operations in 2001 was  comparable  with 2000 results  despite
the decrease in net income due to the magnitude of noncash  charges  increased
depreciation  and second half  reduction in working  capital as sales  declined
corning expects cash from operations in 2002 to be significantly less than 2001
primarily due to lower operating earnings and restructuring  payments  if sales
improve from fourth quarter 2001 levels  corning expects to use cash as working
capital  increases   commensurate  with  higher  demand   cash  and  shortterm
investments on hand at december 31 2001 access to commercial paper markets and
the  revolving  credit  facility are  alternative  sources of  liquidity  these
vehicles are discussed separately below

corning has invested  significant  cash in capital  expansions in the last three
years  during  2001  corning  reduced its capital  spending  program  from its
original plan of 25 billion to conserve cash  capital  spending  totaled 18
billion  17 billion  including 02 billion in accrued capital expenditures
and 757 million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the high level of capital
spending  since 1999  relates  primarily  to capacity  expansions  in  cornings
telecommunications  segment and expanded  research and  development  facilities
cornings 2002 capital spending program is expected to be less than 500 million
as all expansionrelated  programs in the  telecommunications  segment are being
delayed  indefinitely  expansions  in 2002 are  expected to be primarily in the
liquid crystal display and environmental businesses

cornings net investment in shortterm instruments during 2001 was 467 million
compared to its initial net investment of 715 million in 2000 in 2000 corning
began  investing  its  excess  cash in highly  liquid  debt  securities  such as
assetbacked securities  municipal and corporate bonds and us treasury notes
these investments are on deposit with a major financial institution

corning raised approximately 225 million in august 2001 through the issuance of
142 million  shares of common  stock  the proceeds are expected to finance the
acquisition of lucent  technologies  controlling  equity  interests in shanghai
fiber optic co ltd and beijing  fiber optic cable co ltd this  transaction
is expected to close in the first half of 2002

in addition  in november 2001 corning  completed a convertible debt offering of
665 million  due november 1 2008 see note 12 to the  consolidated  financial
statements  for more  detail  corning  intends to use the net  proceeds of this
offering for general corporate purposes

dividends paid to common shareholders in 2001 totaled 112 million compared with
210  million  in 2000  and  176  million  in 1999  on july 9  2001  corning
announced the discontinuation of the payment of dividends on its common stock

cornings working capital decreased from 27 billion at the end of 2000 to 21
billion at the end of 2001 the ratio of current  assets to current  liabilities
was 21 at the  end of  2001  compared  to 24 at the  end of  2000  cornings
working  capital in 2001 and 2000 included large cash and shortterm  investment
balances  excluding cash and shortterm investments  cornings working capital
for 2001 was 106  million  or a decrease of 997  million  compared to 891
million in 2000  the  decrease in noncash  components  of working  capital was
primarily  due to lower  inventories  and a  significant  decrease  in  accounts
receivable days sales outstanding in trade receivables decreased to 54 days for
the fourth  quarter of 2001  from 56 days for the fourth quarter of 2000 as of
december  31  2001  corning had not  provided  vendor  financing to any of its
customers  cornings  longterm debt as a percentage of total capital increased
from 27 at yearend  2000 to 45 at the end of 2001  the increase is primarily
due to the reduction in  shareholders  equity  arising from losses  recorded in
2001 and the issuance of convertible debt in november 2001

financing matters and credit ratings

commercial  paper  borrowings  outstanding  at december 31  2001  totaled 233
million with a weightedaverage  maturity of 23 days cornings commercial paper
program is supported  by the 20  billion  revolving  credit  facility  with 18
banks  expiring on august 17  2005  as of december  31  2001  there were no
borrowings  under the  facility  the  facility  includes a  covenant  requiring
corning to maintain a total debt to capital ratio as defined  not greater than
60 at december 31 2001 this ratio was 47

a  all three credit rating agencies have  maintained a negative  outlook which
     means a rating may be lowered

should business  performance  decline from the levels  experienced in the fourth
quarter of 2001  these  ratings  could  receive  further  review  for  possible
downgrade  a downgrade in shortterm  ratings  could result in a  significantly
reduced  ability  to access the  commercial  paper  market and higher  borrowing
costs  cornings debt  agreements do not include  covenants that accelerate the
maturity of borrowings as a result of changes in credit ratings

a security  rating is not a  recommendation  to buy sell or hold securities and
may be subject to revision or  withdrawal  at any time by the  assigning  rating
organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating

in march 2001 corning filed a universal shelf  registration  statement with the
us securities and exchange commission sec that became effective in the first
quarter  the shelf  permits the  issuance of up to 50 billion of various debt
and equity  securities  as of december 31 2001  cornings  remaining capacity
under its shelf registration was approximately 41 billion

cornings   2001   earnings  were  not  adequate  to  cover  its  fixed  charges
principally  interest  and related  charges on debt  primarily as a result of
losses incurred in cornings  telecommunications  segment and the impairment of
goodwill cornings earnings may not be sufficient to cover its fixed charges in
2002

management  believes  that  corning has ample  liquidity  retains  satisfactory
access to the capital markets and maintains unused revolving credit facilities

noncancelable   sublease  to  quest  diagnostics  totaled  47  million   quest
diagnostics  in turn has a noncancelable  sublease covering  approximately 31
million of the minimum  lease  payments  due to  corning  corning has agreed to
indemnify quest diagnostics should quest  diagnostics  sublessee default on the
minimum lease payments  additionally  corning  continues to guarantee  certain
obligations of quest diagnostics totaling 14 million

at december 31 2001 corning had guaranteed debt of equity affiliates  totaling
16 million in addition  corning and certain of its subsidiaries have provided
other  financial  guarantees and contingent  liabilities in the form of purchase
price  adjustments  related to attainment  of  milestones  standby  letters of
credit  and  performance  bonds  some of which do not have  fixed or  scheduled
expiration dates corning has agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow
corning as discussed in note 9 to the  consolidated  financial  statements  the
funding of the dow corning credit facility is subject to events connected to the
bankruptcy  plan as described  in note 9  management  believes the  significant
majority of the other guarantees and contingent  liabilities will expire without
being funded

inprocess research and development

corning  completed  a  number  of  purchase  acquisitions  in  2000  as part of
analyzing each of these acquisitions  corning made a decision to buy technology
that  had not  yet  been  commercialized  rather  than  develop  the  technology
internally  corning based this  decision on a number of factors  including the
amount of time it would take to bring the  technology  to market  corning  also
considered  its  internal  research  resource  allocation  and its  progress  on
comparable technology  if any corning expects to use the same decision process
in the future

in connection  with the  acquisitions  accounted for under the purchase  method
management  is  responsible  for  estimating  the fair  value of the  assets and
liabilities acquired  management has made estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported  amounts of assets  liabilities  and expenses  resulting from such
acquisitions

amounts  allocated  to  purchased  iprd  were  established   through  recognized
valuation  techniques in the high technology  communications  industry  certain
projects  were  acquired  for  which  technological  feasibility  had  not  been
established at the date of acquisition and for which no alternative  future uses
existed in accordance with sfas no 2 accounting for research and development
costs  as  interpreted  by  financial   accounting   standards   board  fasb
interpretation  no  4  applicability  of fasb  statement  no  2 to  business
combinations  accounted for by the purchase  method  amounts  assigned to iprd
meeting  the  above  criteria  must  be  charged  to  expense  at  the  date  of
consummation of the purchase

the value  allocated to projects for which a charge was recorded was  determined
by the traditional  income approach  which discounts  expected future debtfree
income to present  value  the discount rates used were specific to each project
and were derived from a cost of capital for each  specific  acquisition  target
adjusted upward for the stage of completion of each project

expected future debtfree income was derived with the following considerations

    revenues were estimated based on relevant market size growth trends in the
     industry and individual product sales cycles
    estimated operating expenses included cost of goods sold selling  general
     and  administrative  expenses  and  research and  development  expenses to
     maintain the products once they have been introduced
    estimated tax expenses  were  specific to each acquired  entity and its tax
     profile and
    for certain  projects  as  appropriate  a return on core  technology  was
     deducted based upon market standards for licensed existing technology and a
     return on assets was deducted based upon industry comparisons

                                       26

the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired  technology into  commercially
viable  products  consists  principally  of  planning   designing  and  testing
activities necessary to determine that the product can meet market expectations
corning expects that products  incorporating the acquired  technology from these
projects  will be completed  and will begin to generate cash flows over the five
years following integration

management  expects to continue  supporting  the majority of these  research and
development  efforts  projects  abandoned are noted below  this support is not
expected to change cornings research and development  expense trends  however
the timing and success of development of these  technologies  remains a risk due
to the  remaining  effort  to  achieve  technical  viability  rapidly  changing
customer  markets   uncertain   standards  for  new  products  and  significant
competition in the marketplace

the following is a more detailed  discussion of the valuations  associated  with
acquisitions for which such charges have been recorded

acquisition of pirellis optical components and devices business


on december 12 2000 corning completed the pirelli  transaction  this business
had a significant  number of research and  development  projects  ongoing at the
time of  acquisition  of  which  12 were  valued  as  iprd  projects  projected
debtfree  income was  initially  discounted  using a rate of 17 to reflect the
weightedaverage cost of capital entity risk for this entity each product was
also  discounted  to account for the research  projects  stage of  development
corning recorded a nontax  deductible iprd charge of 323 million in the fourth
quarter of 2000

costs to complete the inprocess  research  programs are expected to approximate
25 million to 30  million  these  projects  have been  categorized  into four
product technologies as follows

lithium niobate modulators

the business is  developing a number of different  lithium  niobate  modulators
lithium niobate  modulators are ideally suited for use in highspeed  longhaul
optical communications networks the technology has been chosen by a majority of
longhaul  equipment  suppliers  because it has the best combination of optical
electronic and reliability performance  five of the research projects qualified
as iprd projects  and the completion  percentages of these five projects ranged
from 1090 a nontax deductible charge of 235 million was recognized and the
value of individual modulator projects inprocess ranged from 19 million to 83
million

submarine products

the business had planned to develop high  reliability  980  nanometer  nm pump
laser chips and modules for submarine use  these devices are components  within
an optical amplifier at the acquisition date two iprd projects with completion
percentages  of 10 and 50 were  valued  a  nontax  deductible  charge of 26
million  resulted  from  980  nm  pump  laser  submarine  projects  in  process
individual research values were 3 million and 23 million

as part of the  downsizing of the photonic  technologies  business  announced on
july 9  2001  corning  abandoned  this  project  this  action  did not have a
material impact on cash flow or the results of operations

gratings

at the date of acquisition  three qualifying  gratings programs with completion
percentages  ranging from 2085 were valued a nontax  deductible iprd charge
of 16 million resulted from gratings programs  individual  inprocess projects
were valued between 2 million and 11 million

as part of the  downsizing of the photonic  technologies  business  announced on
july 9  2001  corning  abandoned  this  project  this  action  did not have a
material impact on cash flow or the results of operations

specialty fiber

two  specialty  fiber  programs  at the  business  met the  definition  of iprd
specialty  fibers are used in conjunction  with several other components to make
an erbium  doped  fiber  amplifier  which  boosts the  strength  of the optical
signal  at the acquisition  date  these projects were 40 and 60 complete  a
nontax  deductible  iprd charge of 46 million  resulted from  specialty  fiber
programs with the largest program being valued at 42 million

                                       27

intellisense


on june 12 2000  corning  completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of
intellisense  a manufacturer and developer of microelectromechanical  systems
mems or small electromechanical  microfabricated devices mems technology
when integrated with optics and packaging expertise  enables the development of
optical adddrop switches and optical cross connects  that are expected to play
a key role in the development and build out of the optical  networking layer as
of the acquisition  date  intellisense had three qualifying  research  projects
underway  these  research and  development  projects are  anticipated to result
primarily  in the  development  of new  telecommunications  products  projected
debtfree  income was  initially  discounted  using a rate of 20 to reflect the
weightedaverage  cost of capital entity risk for  intellisense  each product
was also discounted to account for the research  projects stage of development
the completion  percentages  ranged from 1090  at the acquisition  date the
projected costs to complete the iprd programs approximated 20 million  corning
recorded a 7 million  iprd  charge in the  second  quarter of 2000  no project
valued exceeded 5 million

if  none  of the  projects  are  successfully  completed  corning  may  lose an
opportunity  to capitalize on emerging  markets  failure of any single  project
would not materially impact cornings financial condition results of operations
or liquidity

in all material  respects  the research  projects have progressed as planned at
acquisition

nz applied technologies


on may 5 2000 corning completed the acquisition of nzat nzat was developing a
line of  high  speed  solidstate  components  for  dense  wavelength  division
multiplexing  systems  such as  variable  optical  attenuators  that will meet
industry demands for speed and quality of these projects  four were determined
to meet the criteria for purchased iprd as of the  acquisition  date  projected
debtfree  income was  initially  discounted  using a rate of 21 to reflect the
weightedaverage  cost of capital  entity risk for nzat each product was also
discounted  to account for the  research  projects  stage of  development  the
completion  percentages  ranged  from  1080  at the  acquisition  date  the
projected costs to complete the iprd programs  approximated  10 million  a 44
million  nontax  deductible  iprd  charge  was  recognized  and  the  value  of
individual projects ranged from 1 million to 29 million

if  none  of the  projects  are  successfully  completed  corning  may  lose an
opportunity  to capitalize on emerging  markets  failure of any single  project
would not materially impact cornings financial condition results of operations
or liquidity

in the fourth  quarter  of 2000  nzat  completed  certain  product  development
milestones for its variable optical attenuator products

photonics technology research center


on february 14 2000  corning acquired ptrc  located in suffolk  uk the ptrc
had extensive research and development  efforts underway at the acquisition date
including work on planar integrated optics  semiconductor  optical  amplifiers
electroabsorption  modulators and optical  networking  devices  seven projects
were  determined to meet the criteria for purchased  iprd  projected  debtfree
income was determined for each of the projects and initially  discounted using a
rate of 35 to reflect the  weightedaverage  cost of capital  entity risk for
ptrc  each product was also  discounted  to account for the research  projects
stage of development  the completion  percentages  ranged from 5080  at the
acquisition date the projected costs to complete the iprd programs approximated
40 million  a 42 million 25 million  aftertax  iprd charge was recognized
and the value of  individual  projects  ranged  from less than 1 million to 16
million

if  none  of the  projects  are  successfully  completed  corning  may  lose an
opportunity  to capitalize on emerging  markets  failure of any single  project
would not materially impact cornings financial condition results of operations
or liquidity

environment

corning  has  been  named  by the  environmental  protection  agency  under  the
superfund  act  or  by  state  governments  under  similar  state  laws  as  a
potentially  responsible  party for 12 active  hazardous waste sites  under the
superfund  act  all parties who may have  contributed  any waste to a hazardous
waste site  identified by such agency are jointly and severally liable for the
cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees  otherwise  it is cornings  policy to
accrue  for its  estimated  liability  related  to  superfund  sites  and  other
environmental  liabilities  related to  property  owned and  operated by corning
based on expert analysis and continual  monitoring by both internal and external
consultants  corning has accrued  approximately  24 million for its  estimated
liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation at december 31 2001
based upon the  information  developed  to date  management  believes  that the
accrued  amount is a reasonable  estimate of cornings  estimated  liability and
that the risk of an  additional  loss in an amount  materially  higher than that
accrued is remote

market risk disclosures

corning operates and conducts business in many foreign countries and as a result
is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates  cornings  exposure
to exchange rate effects includes

    exchange  rate  movements  on  financial   instruments   and   transactions
     denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings and
    exchange  rate  movements   upon   conversion  of  net  assets  in  foreign
     subsidiaries  for which the  functional  currency  is not the us  dollar
     which impact cornings net equity

cornings most significant  foreign currency  exposures relate to japan  korea
taiwan and western european  countries  corning selectively enters into foreign
exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 12 months or less
to hedge its  exposure  to  exchange  rate risk on  foreign  source  income  and
purchases  the hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the
underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions the objective of these
contracts is to neutralize  the impact of exchange  rate  movements on cornings
operating  results  corning also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts
when situations  arise where its foreign  subsidiaries  or corning  incorporated
enter into lending situations  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated
in currencies  other than their local  currency  corning does not hold or issue
any derivative  contracts that hedge its foreign currency  denominated net asset
exposures  corning does not hold or issue derivative financial  instruments for
trading purposes

equity in  earnings of  associated  companies  has  historically  represented  a
significant  amount of cornings  income from continuing  operations  equity in
earnings of  associated  companies  was 148 million in 2001 with  foreignbased
affiliates comprising 93 of this amount exchange rate fluctuations and actions
taken by  management  of these  entities  to  reduce  this risk can  affect  the
earnings of these companies

corning uses a sensitivity  analysis to assess the market risk  associated  with
its foreign  currency  exchange  risk  market risk is defined as the  potential
change  in fair  value of  assets  and  liabilities  resulting  from an  adverse
movement in foreign currency  exchange rates at december 31 2001  corning and
its consolidated subsidiaries had open forward contracts open option contracts
foreign  denominated  debt and foreign cash and cash  equivalent  holdings  with
values  exposed to exchange  rate  movements  all of which were  designated  as
hedges at december 31 2001 a 10 adverse  movement in quoted foreign  currency
exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these  instruments of 83
million

the nature of cornings  foreign  exchange rate risk  exposures have not changed
materially from december 31 2000  however  cornings  acquisition  activity in
2000 has expanded its presence in  international  markets and thus increased the
degree of its exposures overall

in  2000   corning  began   investing  in  startup   companies  with  emerging
technologies in the telecommunications  industry these investments are recorded
at cost and contain a high degree of risk as the technologies  under development
may never yield  marketable  products  investments  of this nature totaled 133
million  and 52 million at december  31 2001 and 2000  respectively  corning
routinely assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of these investments
and will impair these assets when a decline in value is other than temporary

critical accounting policies

the preparation of financial  statements  requires  management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein the estimates that require
managements  most  difficult  subjective  or complex  judgments  are described
below the critical judgments impacting the financial statements include

    the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
    inventory writedown and realizability determinations
    salvage values of assets impaired in connection with restructuring actions
    valuation allowances for deferred income taxes and
    purchased iprd

                                       29

in each situation management is required to make estimates about the effects of
matters or future events that are inherently  uncertain  specifically  in its
assessment  of impairment of goodwill and other  intangible  assets  management
made estimates of the fair values based upon forecasted revenues and operations
refer to  impairment  of  goodwill  and other  intangible  assets  for  further
discussion  of  managements   determination  of  its  impairment   charge  an
assessment of inventory  realizability requires management to forecast sales and
future  technological  developments  an estimation of salvage values associated
with  assets to be disposed of requires  judgments  concerning  such  factors as
fluctuating real estate markets and timing of disposal  corning has reduced its
deferred  tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be
realized   in  so  doing  corning  has  estimated  future  taxable  income  in
determining the valuation allowance  valuing purchased iprd requires management
to  estimate  the  amount and timing of future  cash  flows  resulting  from new
product introductions

corning used what it believes are reasonable  assumptions and where  applicable
established valuation techniques in making its estimates

new accounting standards

in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 141  business  combinations  and sfas
no 142  goodwill and other intangible  assets among other  provisions  all
future business  combinations will be accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting  and the use of the  poolingofinterests  method is  prohibited  for
transactions initiated after june 30 2001 in addition goodwill will no longer
be amortized but will be subject to impairment tests at least annually sfas no
142 was  effective  for  corning  on  january  1  2002  an  assessment  of the
recoverability  of goodwill  recorded on the date of adoption  must be performed
within one year  at december  31 2001  goodwill  approximated  19  billion
corning does not anticipate a transitional  impairment  charge from the adoption
of the standard

the following table presents a reconciliation  of reported net loss income and
loss  earnings per share to adjusted net loss income and loss earnings per
share as if sfas no 142 had been in effect as follows

transaction  gains and  losses  affecting  cash  flows are  included  in current
earnings

identifiable  foreign  currency  commitments  gains  and  losses  on  contracts
identified as hedges are deferred and included in the measurement of the related
foreign currency  transactions  gains and losses on foreign currency contracts

availableforsale  which  are  stated  at  estimated  fair  value  these  debt
securities include us treasury notes state and municipal bonds  assetbacked
securities corporate bonds commercial paper and certificates of deposit these
investments are on deposit with a major financial institution  unrealized gains
and losses net of tax are computed on the basis of specific identification and
are reported as a separate component of accumulated other  comprehensive  income
loss in shareholders equity until realized

other investments

corning  has  other  costbased  investments  primarily  in  nonpublicly  traded
companies  these  investments  are included in other  investments  on cornings
balance sheet and are generally carried at cost a decline in the value of these
costbased investments below cost that is deemed other than temporary is charged
to earnings resulting in a new cost basis for that investment

inventories

inventories  are  stated at the  lower of cost  firstin  firstout  basis or
market

property and depreciation

land  buildings and equipment  are recorded at cost  depreciation  is based on
estimated  useful  lives of  properties  using  the  straightline  method  the
estimated  useful lives range from 2040 years for  buildings and 320 years for
the majority of cornings equipment

goodwill and other intangible assets

investment  costs  in  excess  of the  fair  value of net  assets  acquired  are
amortized  over  appropriate  periods not  exceeding 40 years  but  principally
ranging from 5 to 25 years for  acquisitions  over the past three  years  other
intangible  assets are recorded at cost and  amortized  over  periods  generally
ranging from 5 to 20 years

impairment of longlived assets

corning reviews the recoverability of its longlived assets  including goodwill
and other intangible assets  when events or changes in circumstances occur that
indicate  that the  carrying  value of the  asset  may not be  recoverable  the
assessment of possible  impairment is based on cornings  ability to recover the
carrying  value of the  asset  from  the  expected  future  pretax  cash  flows
undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations  if these
cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is
recognized for the difference  between  estimated fair value and carrying value
the measurement of impairment  requires management to estimate the fair value of
longlived assets

1  longlived  assets  primarily  include  investments  plant and  equipment
     goodwill and other intangible assets

4   inventory writedown

during the second quarter major customers in the photonic technologies business
reduced their order forecasts and canceled  orders already placed  as a result
management  determined that certain products were not likely to be sold in their
product life cycle  corning recorded a charge to writedown excess and obsolete
inventory  including  estimated  purchase  commitments  of 273 million  184
million aftertax in cost of sales in the second quarter of 2001 in the fourth
quarter  corning  recorded an  additional  charge of 60 million  37  million
aftertax in cost of sales for excess and obsolete  inventory  primarily in the
photonic technologies business in response to continued weak demand

5   impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets

during the first half of 2001 corning experienced a significant decrease in the
rate of growth of its  telecommunications  segment  primarily  in the  photonic
technologies business  due to a dramatic decline in infrastructure  spending in
the telecommunications  industry  during the second quarter major customers in
the photonic  technologies  business  reduced their order forecasts and canceled
orders  already  placed  as a result  management  determined  that the  growth
prospects of this business were significantly less than previously  expected and
those of historical periods

5   impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets concluded

corning reviews the recoverability of its longlived assets  including goodwill
and other intangible assets  when events or changes in circumstances occur that
indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable  as a result of
the business  conditions noted above  corning  concluded such an assessment was
required for its photonic technologies  business in the second quarter  corning
assesses  recoverability  of the carrying value based upon  cumulative  expected
future pretax cash flows  undiscounted  and without  interest  charges of the
related operations

as a  result  of this  test  corning  determined  that the  longlived  assets
including goodwill and other intangibles  acquired from the pirelli  transaction
in december 2000 as well as those of the unit into which  netoptix  corporation
acquired  in may  2000 had been  integrated  were not  recoverable  cornings
policy is to writedown longlived assets to fair value in such circumstances

management  estimated  fair value using  several  techniques  while each method
generated  comparable fair values  management  adjusted the assets to estimates
based on average  multiples of  forecasted  revenues and earnings of  comparable
publicly  traded  companies  with  operations  in the optical  component  market
segment

in the second  quarter  corning  recorded  pretax charges of 4648 million to
impair a  significant  portion of  goodwill  and 116  million  to impair  other
intangible assets of the total charge of 4764 million 3154 million related
to the pirelli transaction and 1610 million related to goodwill resulting from
the acquisition of netoptix corporation

6   restructuring actions

corning has approved and executed several  restructuring  actions throughout the
year these actions and the charges relating to them are described below

in the first quarter of 2001  corning  reduced its  workforce by  approximately
3300  positions  primarily  in the  photonic  technologies  and  hardware  and
equipment   businesses   these  workforce  reductions  included  mostly  hourly
production  workers and resulted in minimal  severance  charges  in april 2001
corning  completed an  additional  workforce  reduction of  approximately  1000
positions  in  photonic   technologies   including  both  hourly  and  salaried
employees  the second quarter reductions resulted in a restructuring  charge of
8 million 5 million aftertax

in the third quarter of 2001  additional  actions were approved and undertaken
primarily in the telecommunications segment which included the following

    closure of three  manufacturing  facilities  in the  photonic  technologies
     business resulting in the elimination of approximately 800 positions and
    elimination of approximately 2900 positions worldwide in the optical fiber
     and cable  business  this  action  included a voluntary  early  retirement
     program for certain employees along with involuntary separations

as a result of these  actions  corning  recorded a total charge of 339 million
222 million  aftertax which included a restructuring  charge of 103 million
and a charge to impair plant and equipment of 236 million in the third quarter
the restructuring  charge included 6 million for net pension and postretirement
benefit curtailment charges

in  response  to the  continued  deteriorating  business  condition  management
approved and recorded the following restructuring actions in the fourth quarter

    closure or  consolidation  of several  manufacturing  locations  as well as
     smaller businesses across all operating segments
    discontinuation  of  its  initiative  in  corning   microarray   technology
     products part of cornings life sciences business and
    further  headcount  reduction of  approximately  4000 positions across all

     selective  voluntary early retirement  program for certain  employees along
     with involuntary separations

6   restructuring actions concluded

the  carrying  value of a  longlived  asset  is  considered  impaired  when the
expected  separately  identifiable  undiscounted  cash flows from that asset are
less  than  the  carrying  value  of the  asset  the  impairment  charges  were
determined  based on the amount by which the  carrying  value  exceeded the fair
market value of the asset

a significant portion of the assets impaired was recently acquired  or built in
connection with capacity  expansions in  anticipation of future demand  most of
the  impaired  facilities  are  currently  available  for sale  others  will be
demolished  the impaired equipment will be auctioned  sold or disposed during
2002

the facilities  closed in the year primarily relate to the photonics and optical
fiber and cable  businesses  that corning is not exiting  the operations  being
exited comprise the majority of the lighting business of the advanced  materials
segment  this  business is not  material  to  cornings  revenues or  financial
results

in summary  cornings  restructuring  actions  totaled  961 million in pretax
charges for the year ended  december 31 2001  of which 95 million  related to
exit costs primarily for lease  termination and contract  cancellation  charges
approximately one third of this total charge is expected to be paid in cash the
total number of positions  eliminated was  approximately  12000 as of december
31 2001  approximately 10100 of the 12000 employees had been separated under
the plans

noncash  charges for employee  related  costs were 66 million with 35 million
for  pension and  postretirement  termination  benefits  and 31 million for net
pension and postretirement benefit curtailment charges curtailment charges were
recorded primarily due to the decrease in expected future years of service  the

the change in the total  valuation  allowance  for the years ended  december 31
2001 and 2000  was an  increase  of 90  million  and a decrease of 6 million
respectively

corning currently provides income taxes on the earnings of foreign  subsidiaries
and associated companies to the extent they are currently taxable or expected to
be remitted  taxes have not been provided on 1 billion of accumulated  foreign
unremitted earnings which are expected to remain invested indefinitely

corning as required provided for tax on undistributed earnings of its domestic
subsidiaries  and  affiliated  companies  beginning  in 1993 even  though  these
earnings  have been and will  continue to be  reinvested  indefinitely  corning
estimates  that 32  million of tax would be payable on  pre1993  undistributed
earnings  of its  domestic  subsidiaries  and  affiliated  companies  should the
unremitted earnings reverse and become taxable to corning corning expects these
earnings to be reinvested indefinitely

at  december  31  2001   corning  had  tax  benefits   attributable   to  loss
carryforwards and credits  aggregating 264 million that expire at various dates
beginning in 2002 through 2021 if not  utilized  a significant  portion of the
tax benefits for which no valuation allowance has been provided relate to united
states loss  carryforwards  although  realization  is not assured  corning has
concluded  that  it is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  united  states  loss
carryforwards will be realized prior to their expiration date

dow corning corporation

corning is a 50 owner of dow corning corporation dow corning  a manufacturer
of silicones  the other 50 of dow corning is owned by the dow chemical company
dow chemical

on may  15  1995  dow  corning  sought  protection  under  the  reorganization
provisions  of chapter  11 of the  united  states  bankruptcy  code and  thereby
obtained  a  stay  of  approximately  19000  breastimplant  product  liability
lawsuits  on november 8 1998  dow  corning and the tort  claimants  committee
jointly filed a revised plan of reorganization  joint plan which was confirmed
by the  bankruptcy  court on november  30  1999  on  december  21  1999  the
bankruptcy  court issued an opinion that approved the principal  elements of the
joint  plan with  respect to tort  claimants  but  construed  the joint plan as
providing  releases  for third  parties  including  corning and dow chemical as
shareholders  only with  respect  to tort  claimants  who voted in favor of the
joint plan on november 13 2000 the district court entered an order  reversing
the bankruptcy  courts  december 21 1999 opinion on the release and injunction
provisions  and confirmed the joint plan on october 23 2001 the us court of
appeals for the sixth circuit  heard oral  arguments on appeals taken by foreign
claimants  the us government and certain tort claimants from various portions
of the district  courts order on january 29 2002 the sixth circuit  affirmed
the  determinations  made in the  district  court with  respect  to the  foreign
claimants  but  remanded to the  district  court for further  proceedings  with
respect to the claims of the us  government  for recovery of medical  expenses
paid on behalf of tort claimants and with respect to the findings supporting the
nondebtor  releases in favor of dow cornings  shareholders and insurers  as a
result of the remand  there may be additional  hearings in the district  court
the timing and scope of the  proceedings  on remand are not known at this point
and the  sixth  circuits  ruling  adds some  uncertainty  with  respect  to the
ultimate  confirmation  of the joint  plan  if the joint plan is upheld but the
shareholder  releases are not given their full effect  corning  would expect to
defend any remaining  claims against it and any new claims on the same grounds
that led to a series of orders  and  judgments  dismissing  all  claims  against
corning in the federal  courts and in many state courts as  described  under the
heading implant tort lawsuits in legal proceedings item 3 management believes
that  the  claims  against  corning  lack  merit  and that  the  breast  implant
litigation against corning will be resolved without material impact on cornings
financial statements

under the terms of the joint plan  dow corning would be required to establish a
settlement trust and a litigation facility to provide a means for tort claimants
to settle or litigate  their claims  dow corning  would have the  obligation to
fund the trust and the facility  over a period of up to 16 years  in an amount
up to  approximately  33  billion  subject  to  the  limitations  terms  and
conditions  stated in the joint plan  corning and dow chemical have each agreed
to provide a credit  facility to dow corning of up to 150 million 300 million
in the aggregate subject to the terms and conditions stated in the joint plan
the joint plan also provides for dow corning to make full payment  through cash
and the issuance of senior notes  to its commercial  creditors  the commercial
creditors have contested the bankruptcy courts disallowance of their claims for
postpetition  interest at default  rates of interest  and have appealed to the
district  court  while the  amounts at issue on this  appeal  are  subject to a
variety of  contingencies  it is possible that the aggregate claim exceeds 100
million  dow  corning is  vigorously  contesting  the  appeal  if and when dow
corning  emerges from  bankruptcy  corning expects to resume the recognition of
equity earnings from dow corning  corning does not expect to receive  dividends
from dow corning in the foreseeable future

pittsburgh corning corporation

corning and ppg industries inc each own 50 of the capital stock of pittsburgh
corning  corporation  pcc pcc and several other defendants have been named in
numerous  lawsuits  involving  claims alleging  personal injury from exposure to
asbestos  on april 16  2000  pcc filed for chapter 11  reorganization  in the
united states  bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania  as of
the bankruptcy  filing  pcc had in excess of 140000 open claims and now has in
excess  of  240000  open  claims  in the  bankruptcy  court  pcc  obtained  a
preliminary  injunction  against the prosecution of asbestos actions against its
two shareholders to afford the parties a period of time the injunction  period
in which to negotiate a plan of  reorganization  for pcc the injunction  period
has been  extended  until  april 15  2002  under  the terms of the  bankruptcy
courts  order  pcc ppg  industries  and corning  will have 90 days  following
expiration of the injunction period to seek removal and transfer of stayed cases
that have not been  resolved  through a plan of  reorganization  as a result of
pccs bankruptcy filing  corning recorded an aftertax charge of 36 million in
the  first  quarter  of  2000  to  impair  its  entire  investment  in  pcc  and
discontinued  recognition  of  equity  earnings  at  the  time  pcc  filed  for
bankruptcy  protection  there were approximately  12400 claims pending against
corning  alleging  various  theories  of  liability  based on  exposure to pccs
asbestos products although the outcome of litigation and the bankruptcy case is
uncertain  management  believes that the separate  corporate status of pcc will
continue to be upheld management is continuing to investigate cornings options
for defending claims against it which might include vigorously defending itself
on all fronts or exploring a global settlement through the bankruptcy  process
it is probable that there will be intensive  negotiations  throughout  the first
half of 2002 concerning terms of pccs plan of reorganization including whether
or not corning and its  insurers may  participate  by making a  contribution  in
exchange for a release  management cannot estimate the probability that corning
will be able to secure such a release upon terms and conditions  satisfactory to
corning and its insurers the range of cost for these options net of insurance
cannot be estimated at this time  although  asbestos  litigation  is inherently
difficult and the outcome of litigation is uncertain management believes these
matters  will be  resolved  without a  materially  adverse  impact on  cornings
financial  position  if corning and its insurers  agree to a global  settlement
through the bankruptcy  process  such outcome may be material to the results of
operations of the period in which such costs if any are recognized

corning and ppg  industries  inc each own 50 of the capital stock of pcc pcc
and several  other  defendants  have been named in numerous  lawsuits  involving
claims alleging  personal injury from exposure to asbestos  it is probable that
there  will  be  intensive  negotiations  throughout  the  first  half  of  2002
concerning  terms of pccs  plan of  reorganization  including  whether  or not
corning and its insurers may  participate by making a  contribution  in exchange
for a release  management  cannot estimate the probability that corning will be
able to secure such a release upon terms and conditions  satisfactory to corning
and its insurers  the range of cost for these options net of insurance cannot
be estimated at this time although asbestos litigation is inherently difficult
and the outcome of litigation is uncertain  management  believes  these matters
will be resolved  without a materially  adverse  impact on  cornings  financial
position for a broader discussion see note 9

the ability of certain  subsidiaries and associated  companies to transfer funds
is limited by  provisions  of certain  loan  agreements  and foreign  government
regulations  at  december  31  2001  the  amount  of equity  subject  to such
restrictions  for  consolidated  subsidiaries  totaled 84  million  while this
amount is legally  restricted  it does not result in  operational  difficulties
since  corning  has  generally  permitted  subsidiaries  to retain a majority of
equity to support their growth  programs  at december 31 2001 loans of equity
affiliates  guaranteed by corning totaled 16 million in addition  corning and
certain  of its  subsidiaries  have  provided  other  financial  guarantees  and
contingent  liabilities  in the form of purchase  price  adjustments  related to
attainment of milestones  standby letters of credit and performance  bonds as
described  in note 9  corning  has agreed to provide a credit  facility  to dow
corning up to 150 million  the amounts of these obligations are represented in
the following table in millions

the funding of the dow corning credit facility is subject to events connected to
the bankruptcy plan as described in note 9 management  believes the significant
majority of the other guarantees and contingent  liabilities will expire without
being funded

hedging activities

corning operates and conducts business in many foreign  countries  as a result
there is exposure to  potentially  adverse  movement  in foreign  currency  rate
changes  corning enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with
durations  generally 12 months or less to reduce its  exposure to exchange  rate
risk on foreign source income and purchases the objective of these contracts is
to  neutralize  the  impact of  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  movements  on
cornings operating results

corning engages in foreign currency  hedging  activities to reduce the risk that
changes in exchange  rates will  adversely  affect the  eventual  net cash flows
resulting  from the sale of products to foreign  customers  and  purchases  from
foreign  suppliers  the hedge contracts  reduce the exposure to fluctuations in
exchange rate  movements  because the gains and losses  associated  with foreign
currency balances and transactions are generally offset with gains and losses of
the hedge  contracts  because the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates
on hedge  contracts  offsets the related  impact on the  underlying  items being
hedged these financial instruments help alleviate the risk that might otherwise
result from currency exchange rate fluctuations

the following table in millions summarizes the notional amounts and respective
fair values of the derivative financial  instruments at december 31 2001 these
contracts are held by corning and its subsidiaries and mature at varying dates

                                            notional amount       fair value

   foreign exchange option contracts            140                   4

the  forward  and  option  contracts  used by corning in  managing  its  foreign
currency  exposures contain an element of risk in that the counterparties may be
unable to meet the terms of the agreements however corning minimizes this risk
by limiting the counterparties to a diverse group of highlyrated major domestic
and international  financial institutions with which corning has other financial
relationships   corning  is  exposed  to  potential  losses  in  the  event  of
nonperformance  by these  counterparties  however  corning does not expect to
record any losses as a result of counterparty default  corning does not require
and is not required to place collateral for these financial instruments

in  december  1998  one  of  cornings   subsidiaries  entered  into  financing
agreements  which  provide  for the sale of certain  future yen based  revenues
beginning  february 1999 and expiring in december  2001  these  contracts  were
terminated in july 2000  these contracts  required the  counterparty to advance
us  dollars in amounts up to 10  million  each month and corning to repay the
notes only to the extent of future yen  denominated  revenues  the  obligations
under these contracts were not cancelable by either party  borrowings under the
agreements bore interest at a premium to the eurodollar rate  transaction gains
or  losses  related  to these  contracts  were  deferred  and  recognized  as an
adjustment to the revenue securing the note repayments borrowings were recorded
on the balance sheet only to the extent they were  outstanding  the  cumulative
borrowings  between  january  2000 and july  2000 were 60  million  cumulative
repayments approximated 66 billion yen for the same period

17  loss earnings per common share

basic  earnings  per share is computed by dividing  income  available  to common
shareholders  the  numerator by the  weightedaverage  number of common shares
outstanding the denominator for the period diluted earnings per share assumes
that any dilutive convertible preferred shares  subordinated notes convertible
zero coupon  debentures and convertible  debentures  outstanding were converted
with related preferred stock dividend requirements and outstanding common shares
adjusted  accordingly  it also  assumes  that  outstanding  common  shares were
