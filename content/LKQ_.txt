covid19 impact 

the covid19 pandemic and the resulting governmental actions taken to control the virus have impacted and are expected to continue to impact our business in 2020 2021 and into 2022 the effects include but are not limited to a reduction in demand for our products and services relative to 2019 liquidity challenges for certain of our customers and suppliers and organizational changes such as personnel reductions and route consolidation undertaken mostly in 2020 driven by cost actions to mitigate the actual and expected revenue decline the continuing impact of covid19 on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments including the severity and duration of the pandemic and the related impact on the global economy which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time for further discussion regarding the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business and financial results see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

north america segment 

our north america segment is composed of wholesale operations which consists of aftermarket and salvage operations and self service retail operations 

wholesale operations 

our wholesale operations in north america sell five product types aftermarket oem recycled oem remanufactured oem refurbished and to a lesser extent new oem parts to professional collision and mechanical vehicle repair businesses which represents the source of the majority of the revenue generated by the segment additionally by way of two acquisitions in 2019 we entered the diagnostics and repair services business which we expect to grow in the coming years as the number of technological comp onents in vehicles increases in january 2021 the diagnostic and repair services acquisitions were combined into a single brand known as elitek vehicle services 

inventory 

our principal aftermarket product types consist of those most frequently damaged in collisions including bumper covers automotive body panels lights and automotive glass products such as windshields platinum plus is our exclusive product line offered under the keystone brand of aftermarket products we also developed a product line called “value line” for more value conscious often selfpay consumers certain of our products are certified by an independent organization the certified automotive parts association “capa” capa is an association that evaluates the quality of aftermarket collision replacement products compared to oem collision replacement products our salvage products include both mechanical and collision parts including engines transmissions door assemblies sheet metal products such as trunk lids fenders and hoods lights and bumper assemblies 

the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from independent manufacturers and distributors located primarily in north america and asia principally taiwan in 2021 approximately 44 of our aftermarket purchases were made from our top 6 vendors with our largest vendor providing approximately 11 of our annual inventory purchases for the north america segment we believe we are one of the largest customers of each of these suppliers outside of this group no other supplier provided more than 5 of our supply of aftermarket products in 2021 we purchased approximately 44 of our aftermarket products in 2021 directly from manufacturers in taiwan and other asian countries approximately 53 of our aftermarket products were purchased from vendors located in the us however we believe the majority of these products were manufactured in taiwan mexico or other foreign countries 

within our wholesale operations we focus our procurement on products that are in the most demand based on a number of factors such as historical sales records of vehicles by model and year customer requests and projections of future supply and demand trends because lead times may be historically 40 days or more on imported aftermarket products sales volumes and instock inventory are important factors in the procurement process 

we procure recycled products for our wholesale operations by acquiring total loss vehicles typically sold at regional salvage auctions and then dismantling and inventorying the parts the availability and pricing of the salvage vehicles we procure for our wholesale recycled products operations may be impacted by a variety of factors including the production level of new vehicles and the percentage of damaged vehicles declared total losses our bidding specialists are equipped with a proprietary software application that allows them to compare the vehicles at salvage auctions against our current inventory levels historical demand and recent average selling prices to arrive at an estimated maximum bid additionally we have embedded artificial 

intelligence technology into our salvage procurement software to assist in the procurement decision making process reducing the amount of labor and human error in the process 

scrap and other materials 

our salvage operations generate scrap metal and other materials that we sell to metals recyclers vehicles that have been dismantled for recycled products and crush only endoflife vehicles acquired from other companies are typically crushed using equipment on site in other cases we will hire mobile crushing equipment to crush the vehicles before they are transported to shredders and scrap metal processors damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products including wheels we also sell the precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts such as catalytic converters 

customers 

we sell our products to wholesale customers that include collision and mechanical repair shops and new and used car dealerships as well as to retail customers the majority of these customers tend to be individuallyowned small businesses although the number of independent and dealeroperated collision repair facilities has declined over the last decade as regional or national multiple shop operators mso have increased their geographic presence through consolidation 

automobile insurance companies affect the demand for our collision products while insurance companies do not pay for our products directly they ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount as a result insurance companies often influence the types of products used in a repair the use of our alternative products instead of new oem products provides a direct benefit to insurance companies by lowering the cost of repairs by often decreasing the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and by providing a replacement product that is of high quality and comparable performance to the part replaced 

our sales personnel are encouraged to promote lkq to customers as a “onestop shop” by offering comparable options from our other product lines if the desired part is not in stock to support these efforts our sales staff has access to both recycled and aftermarket sales systems to encourage cross selling 

to better serve our customers we take a consolidated approach to the electronic sale of wholesale products in our north america segment a full suite of ecommerce services is available to approved partners that helps us improve order accuracy reduce return rate and better fit our customer workflow using these services in coordination with our partners products can be searched priced and ordered without leaving the customers own operating systems 

distribution 

we have a distribution network of warehouses and cross dock facilities which allows us to develop and maintain our service levels with local repair shops while providing industry leading fulfillment rates that are made possible by our nationwide presence our delivery fleet utilizes a third party software provider to optimize delivery routes and to track the progress of delivery vehicles throughout their runs this third party software connects into each of our wholesale systems to allow a single interface for our management team to have a single delivery to our customer regardless of the product line or operating system our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries as required by our customers using drivers who routinely deliver to the same customers our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network we operate a delivery fleet of mediumsized trucks and smaller trucks and vans which deliver multiple product types on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs and improve customer service 

competition 

we consider all suppliers of vehicle collision and mechanical products to be competitors including aftermarket suppliers recycling businesses refurbishing operations parts remanufacturers oems and internetbased suppliers we compete with alternative parts distributors on the basis of our nationwide distribution system our product lines and inventory availability customer service our relationships with insurance companies and to a lesser extent price we compete with oems primarily on the basis of price and to a lesser extent on service and product quality we do not consider retail chains that focus on the doityourself market to be our direct competitors since many of our wholesale product sales are influenced by insurance companies who ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount rather than the end user and there is limited overlap in the products that we sell 

information technology systems 

in our aftermarket operations we use a third party enterprise management system and other third party software packages for an electronic data interchange tool and ecommerce tools to enhance our online businesstobusiness initiatives  orderkeystonecom and keyless 

our wholesale recycled product locations in north america operate an internallydeveloped proprietary enterprise management system called lkqx we believe that the use of a single system across a majority of our wholesale recycled product operations helps facilitate the sales process allows for continued implementation of standard operating procedures and improves training efficiency employee transferability access to our national inventory database management reporting and data storage the system also supports an electronic exchange process for identifying and locating parts at other select recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock 

we also use other third party software packages for both businesses to leverage the centralized data and information that a single system provides such as a data warehouse to conduct enhanced analytics and reporting and an integrated budgeting system 

self service operations 

our self service retail operations most of which operate under the name “lkq pick your part” allow consumers to come directly to the yard to pick parts off of salvage vehicles in addition to revenue from the sale of parts core scrap steel and other metals we charge a nominal admission fee to access the property 

inventory 

we acquire inventory for our self service retail product operations from a variety of sources including but not limited to towing companies vehicle auctions the general public municipality sales insurance carriers and charitable organizations we procure salvage vehicles for our self service retail product operations that are generally older and priced lower than the salvage vehicles we purchase for our wholesale recycled product operations vehicles are delivered to our locations by the seller or we arrange for transportation once on our property minimal labor is required to process the vehicle other than removing the battery fluids refrigerants catalytic converters and hazardous materials the extracted fluids are stored in bulk and subsequently sold to recyclers vehicles are then placed in the yard for customers to remove parts in our self service business availability of a specific part will depend on which vehicles are currently at the site and to what extent parts may have been previously sold we usually keep a vehicle at our facility for 30 to 120 days depending on the capacity of the yard and size of the market before it is crushed and sold to scrap metal processors 

scrap and other materials 

our self service operations generate scrap metal alloys and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that we no longer make available to the public and crush only vehicles acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products including wheels we also extract and sell the precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts such as catalytic converters 

customers 

the customers of our self service yards are frequently doityourself mechanics small independent repair shops servicing older vehicles auto rebuilders and resellers the scrap from the vehicle hulks when not processed by us is sold to metals recyclers with whom we may also compete when procuring salvage vehicles for our operations 

competition 

there are competitors operating self service businesses in all of the markets in which we operate in some markets there are numerous competitors often operating in close proximity to our operations we try to differentiate our business by the quality of the inventory and the size and cleanliness of the property we also differentiate our business from our competitors through our app which allows customers to receive daily push notifications when vehicles in which they have identified an interest are placed into their favorite yards in addition to allowing customers to see our available inventory the app also allows customers to input search parameters including for specific parts and the year make and model of the vehicle to identify the population 

of vehicles that might be available from which to pull compatible parts we do not consider retail chains that focus on the doityourself market to be our direct competitors as there is limited overlap in the products that we sell 

europe segment 

our europe segment operates in over 20 countries and was built on four key acquisitions ecp 2011 sator 2013 rhiag 2016 and stahlgruber 2018 additionally in 2014 we expanded our european segment to include wholesale recycling operations through our acquisition of a business with salvage and vehicle repair facilities in sweden and norway and in 2016 we acquired an equity investment in mekonomen ab mekonomen the leading independent car parts distributor in the nordic region of europe mekonomen is independent of our existing european operations but we have identified areas where the companies can work together in a mutually beneficial manner primarily related to procurement and category management 

1 lkq europe 

our european strategy facilitated through our 1 lkq europe program is to leverage the strengths of acquired businesses reduce procurement costs by consolidating and streamlining our product offerings and combine into an integrated organization driving for functional excellence with the necessary technology linking our business processes with our customers and suppliers as part of our 1 lkq europe program we are integrating our european operations as we optimize purchasing warehousing systems logistics and backoffice functions and align our private label products across the segment we are reorganizing our noncustomerfacing teams and support systems through various projects including the implementation of a common erp platform rationalization of our product portfolio and creation of a europe headquarters office and central back office while certain projects were delayed in 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic such as our procurement initiatives and the new headquarters in switzerland we also accelerated certain projects such as the integration of previously acquired networks and sharing of resources across lkq europe we have continued the project on schedule after the restart we completed the organizational design and implementation projects in june 2021 with the remaining projects scheduled to be completed by 2024 

inventory 

our inventory is primarily composed of mechanical aftermarket parts for the repair of vehicles 3 to 15 years old our top selling products include brake pads discs and sensors clutches electrical products such as spark plugs and batteries steering and suspension products filters and oil and automotive fluids we currently have over 900000 uniq ue part numbers our goal is to reduce the complexit y of our product portfolio reduce the number of parts offered and reduce the number of suppliers we have phased out or replaced more than 150 brands in the past couple of years we believe that more than 70 of our product portfolio existing at the start of the program in 2019 could be reviewed for possible reduction 

in 2021 our top supplier represented 8 of our aftermarket inventory purchases for our europe segment no other suppliers comprised more than 5 of our purchases further we purchased 93 of our products from companies in europe and 73 and 17 of our total inventory purchases were made in euros and pounds sterling respectively in 2021 as part of our 1 lkq europe initiatives we are expanding the distribution of our private label products our key strategic private label products are optimal era and mpm oils 

in our nordic operations we purchase severely damaged or total loss vehicles from insurance companies which are transferred to our dismantling facilities or sold to other third party dismantlers 

customers 

we primarily operate a twostep ie direct sales to repair shop customers distribution model in europe although certain businesses located in italy the netherlands germany switzerland and hungary operate partially a threestep ie sales to distributors who in turn sell to repair shop customers distribution model in our twostep operations we sell the majority of our products to commercial customers primarily consisting of professional repairers including both independent mechanical repair shops and collision repair shops in our threestep operations we sell products to wholesale distributors or jobbers in addition to our sales to repair shops and wholesale distributors we generate a portion of our revenue through sales to retail customers from ecommerce platforms and from counter sales at the branch locations 

distribution 

our european operations employ a distribution model in which inventory is stored at national or international distribution centers or regional hubs with fast moving product stored at branch locations the large distribution centers regularly restock the smaller branches and hubs and hold slower moving items helping us to improve fulfillment rates product is moved through the distribution network on our trucks vans or via common carrier we have built a new central distribution center in the netherlands similar to our central distribution centers in tamworth england and sulzbachrosenberg germany that will allow us to consolidate multiple regional distribution centers we believe that our distribution network is larger than those of any of our principal competitors in europe 

competition 

we view all suppliers of replacement repair products as our competitors including other alternative parts suppliers and oems and their dealer networks we face significant competition in many markets where even smaller competitors can compete on price and service and the oems compete via ties to brand loyalty of the consumer while also remaining competitive on price service and availability we believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other alternative parts suppliers primarily through our distribution network efficient stock management systems and proprietary technology which allows us to deliver our products quickly as well as through our product lines and inventory availability pricing and service reliability 

information technology systems 

our aftermarket operations in europe use various information technology it systems our systems are complex and designed to perform a variety of tasks depending on the market including but not limited to customer orders inventory management warehouse and logistics and financial reporting certain of our it systems can interface with the respective it systems of our repair shop customers which enables our customers to identify and order the part required for the repair as part of our 1 lkq europe strategy to create an integrated european company we initiated a multiyear program to develop and implement a european wide enterprise resource planning erp system which will reduce the number of it systems we operate a pilot for the erp system was successfully deployed in our operating unit in switzerland in the first quarter of 2020 after a pause during 2020 due to the disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic the implementation of the erp program resumed and we implemented the new erp system in italy in the second half of 2021

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related repairs our aftermarket glass operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the second and third quarters when the demand for automotive replacement glass increases after the winter weather our specialty vehicle operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the second quarter when vehicle owners tend to install this equipment and lower revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter when the number of rv trips tends to decline as a result of the winter weather however the covid19 pandemic created an increased demand in the rv market in 2020 and 2021 and the effect on demand extended into the fourth quarter of 2021 additionally seasonality may affect our product mix for example collision parts tend to have higher demand in the winter as there are generally higher accident rates 

environmental social and governance matters 

environmental 

we contribute to a healthy environment for example our north american recycling operations harvest vehicle components for reuse in the repair of vehicles once the parts are harvested the remaining valuable materials are removed and repurposed for use in the manufacturing of new basic materials such as steel aluminum plastic and rubber additionally we extract fluids that we recycle or utilize in our own operations such as fuel to run our own truck fleet 

our recycling efforts are a key pillar of our mission statement of being a responsible steward of the environment and a true partner with the communities in which we operate this stewardship has been embedded in our culture since the company’s founding in 1998 our recycling efforts preserve natural resources reduce the demand for scarce landfill space and help decrease air and water pollution 

the table below highlights our north american recycling operation’s efforts in 2021 to minimize the environmental impact of total loss and endoflife vehicles with effective and proper vehicle disposition and lists the approximate number or amount of parts or other materials removed from such vehicles and sold or used by us in our operations 



social 

we continuously strive to improve the effect of our operations and the awareness of all of our employees with respect to social issues refer to the human capital section above for more information 

we also strive to improve the communities in which we operate the employees at our facilities are encouraged to volunteer in local community activities and we have established a charitable foundation to distribute funds to local causes 

governance 

we continue to make substantial progress in the area of corporate governance our board of directors refreshment process has resulted in over half of our current board being added since august 2018 and we have three women on our board additionally over 80 of our directors are independent we believe that the skill sets of our newly constituted board effectively address the areas of focus that are important for our short and longterm strategic objectives including the continued focus on the integration of our european operations 

we have adopted “proxy access” which permits an eligible stockholder to nominate and include in our proxy materials director nominees subject to the terms set forth in our bylaws we also have majority voting for the election of our directors requiring a director who fails to receive a majority vote to tender his or her resignation to the board 

our board of directors adopted a revised code of ethics in 2019 to help ensure that everyone at lkq is clear on our mission values and guiding ethical principles the code of ethics covers a variety of topics including the use of company assets bribery and corruption conflicts of interest discrimination harassment health and safety privacy and data protection protecting confidential information and reporting code of ethics violations it is now available in over 20 languages through our website at wwwlkqcorpcom  we also now operate one single anonymous global speak up line available in every language in which we routinely conduct business 




 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the occurrence of any of the following risks or of unknown risks and uncertainties may adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition for a summary of risk factors refer to special note on forwardlooking statements in part i of this annual report on form 10k 

risks relating to our business 

our operating results and financial condition have been and will likely continue to be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic and could be adversely affected by other public health emergencies 

the covid19 pandemic resulted in additional risks that could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

efforts to combat the virus have been complicated by viral variants and uneven access to and acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines globally the pandemic resulted in governments and other authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and business closures these measures have impacted and may continue to impact our workforce and operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers these measures also resulted in a reduction in miles driven as a result we have experienced and may continue to experience unpredictable reductions in demand for our products we were permitted to operate in most of the jurisdictions we serve including in jurisdictions that mandated the closure of certain businesses however there is no assurance that we will be permitted to continue operations under future government orders or other restrictions and although certain restrictions related to the covid19 pandemic have eased uncertainty continues to exist regarding such measures and potential future measures 

continued uncertainties related to the magnitude duration and persistent effects of the covid19 pandemic may significantly adversely affect our business these uncertainties include among other things the duration and impact of the resurgence in covid19 cases the emergence contagiousness and threat of new and different strains of virus the availability acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines additional closures or other actions as mandated or otherwise made necessary by governmental authorities including employee vaccine mandates disruptions in the supply chain including those caused by industry capacity constraints material availability and global logistics delays and constraints arising from among other things the transportation capacity of ocean shipping containers and a prolonged delay in resumption of operations by one or more key suppliers or the 

failure of any key supplier an increasingly competitive labor market due to a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover caused by the covid19 pandemic our ability to meet commitments to customers on a timely basis as a result of increased costs and supply and transportation challenges increased logistics costs additional operating costs due to continued remote working arrangements adherence to social distancing guidelines and other covid19 related challenges increased risk of cyberattacks on network connections used in remote working arrangements absence of employees due to illness and the impact of the pandemic on our customers and suppliers we have developed and implemented business continuity plans and health and safety protocols in an effort to mitigate the negative impacts we have experienced related to covid19 to our employees and our business an inability to respond to the ever changing impacts of covid19 to our employees and business could negatively impact our financial results in addition even if the adverse effects of the covid19 pandemic subside there is the possibility of the emergence of a different pandemic or health emergency with similar economic disruptions these factors and others that are currently unknown or considered immaterial could materially and adversely affect the company’s business liquidity results of operations and financial position 

our operating results and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the economic political and social conditions in the us europe and elsewhere as well as the economic health of vehicle owners and numbers and types of vehicles sold 

changes in economic political and social conditions in the us europe and other countries in which we are located or do business could have a material effect on our company negative effects to our supply chain costs of doing business sales and distribution activity may occur due to factors such as war or threats of war natural disasters nuclear facility accidents public health emergencies utility interruptions terrorism and social unrest 

our business is also affected by a number of other factors for example the number and types of new vehicles produced and sold by manufacturers affects our business a decrease in the number of vehicles on the road may result in a decrease in repairs 

our sales are also impacted by changes to the economic health of vehicle owners the economic health of vehicle owners is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit taxation fuel prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside of our control if inflationary pressures or any of these other conditions worsen our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities and hedge transactions these unfavorable events affecting our business partners could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we have a substantial business presence in europe including a significant presence in the uk and the republic of ireland “roi” in june 2016 voters in the uk decided by referendum to withdraw from the european union also known as brexit the uk’s withdrawal from the european union became effective on january 31 2020 the uk and the european union negotiated a trade and cooperation agreement “tca” to govern the new relationship which became effective on january 1 2021 following the adoption of the tca duties have increased on some of the products we import into the uk and we have observed shipment delays particularly with respect to the products we supply to our business in the roi while the longterm extent and impact of these issues remains unclear at this point they could have adverse impacts on our business notwithstanding the tca there continues to be uncertainty regarding the effects of brexit on our uk and european businesses including with respect to tariffs or trade sanctions on goods moving between the jurisdictions increased administrative burdens fluctuations in exchange rates disruptions in access to markets by uk and roi companies and disagreements about the interpretation of the tca 

we also have a presence in the ukraine and are monitoring the political situation there carefully additionally a number of our suppliers are based in china and taiwan and so increasing strains and any political repercussions may have implications upon our supply chain 

the widespread use of social media platforms has increased the speed and scope that information or misinformation about us can be disseminated and could hamper our ability to correct misrepresentations or to otherwise respond effectively to negative publicity negative posts about us our employees our business practices or our products or services whether or not valid could seriously damage our brands and reputation 

we face competition from local national international and internetbased vehicle products providers and this competition could negatively affect our business 

the vehicle replacement products industry and vehicle accessory parts industry are highly competitive and are served by numerous suppliers of oem recycled aftermarket refurbished and remanufactured products within each of these categories of suppliers there are local owneroperated companies larger regional suppliers national and international providers and internetbased suppliers and distributors providers of vehicle replacement and accessory products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of vehicle products which may further increase competition some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise greater financial technical manufacturing distribution and other resources longer operating histories lower cost structures and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries or with consumers than we do business transacted on online marketplaces has been increasing which presents additional competitive pressures on us in addition facilitators of these online marketplaces control access to this channel and may prohibit us from participating 

in the us and europe local companies have formed cooperative efforts in an attempt to more efficiently compete against us in all aspects of our business as a result of these factors our competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply provide their products at lower costs or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve 

we believe that a majority of collision parts by dollar amount are supplied by oems with the balance being supplied by distributors of alternative aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured collision parts like us the oems are therefore able to exert pricing pressure in the marketplace we compete with the oems primarily on price and to a lesser extent on service and quality our operations worldwide are dependent upon clear laws and regulation regarding the manufacture of automotive parts in competition with oem parts 

from time to time the oems have engaged in efforts seeking to increase oem market share and to restrict consumers’ choice to use recycled or aftermarket parts to repair consumers’ vehicles examples of these efforts include blocking the use of vehicle telematics by the independent repair industry demanding that suppliers provide certain parts exclusively to the oems embedding software in certain vehicle parts that prevents them from being recycled and used to repair other vehicles repair shop certification programs that in some cases require the repair shops to use only oem parts refusing to sell certain oem parts unless the buyer is an oemcertified shop obtaining patents and trademarks on various subcomponents of vehicles to prohibit the use of an aftermarket part alternative and price matching and rebate programs on certain aftermarket products see the risk factor entitled “ intellectual property claims relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business ” for further information about the oem patents and trademarks 

with respect to telematics vehicles are increasingly being equipped with systems that transmit data to the oems wirelessly regarding among other items accident incidents maintenance requirements location of the vehicle identification of the closest dealership and other statistics about the vehicle and its driving history to the extent that this data is not shared with alternative suppliers the oems will have an advantage with respect to such matters as contacting the vehicle driver recommending repairs and maintenance and directing the vehicle owner to an affiliated dealership 

the frequency and intensity of these oem efforts has been increasing over time the growth and effectiveness of these efforts or the introduction of new ones could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we rely upon our customers and insurance companies to promote the usage of alternative parts 

our success depends in part on the acceptance and promotion of alternative parts usage by automotive insurance companies and vehicle repair facilities there can be no assurance that current levels of alternative parts usage will be maintained or will increase in the future 

we rely on business relationships with insurance companies these insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide the business relationships include in some cases participation in aftermarket quality and service assurance programs that may result in a higher usage of our aftermarket products than would be the case without the programs our arrangements with these companies may be terminated by them at any time including in connection with their own business concerns relating to the offering availability standards or operations of the aftermarket quality and service assurance programs we rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in an illinois lawsuit involving state farm mutual automobile insurance company avery v state farm a jury decided in october 1999 that state farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using nonoem replacement products to repair damaged vehicles when use of such products did not restore the vehicle to its preloss condition the jury found that state farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of nonoem replacement products and the alleged inferiority of those products damages in excess of 1 billion were assessed against state farm in august 2005 the illinois supreme court reversed the awards made by the lower courts and found among other things that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any breach of contract by state farm the plaintiffs filed a subsequent claim alleging that state farm improperly influenced one of the justices on the illinois supreme court prior to trial on the subsequent claim the parties settled the case as part of the settlement state farm paid the plaintiffs 250 million as a result of this case some insurance companies reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket products our financial results could be adversely affected if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled products from us due to a fear of similar claims 

in addition to the extent that the collision repair industry continues to consolidate the buying power of collision repair shop customers may further increase putting additional pressure on our financial returns 

intellectual property claims relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business 

oems and others have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims oems have brought such claims in federal court and with the us international trade commission in some cases we have entered into patent license agreements with oems that allow us to sell aftermarket parts that replicate the patented parts in exchange for a royalty and otherwise in accordance with the terms of the agreements 

to the extent oems and other manufacturers obtain design patents or trademarks and are successful in asserting claims of infringement of these patents or trademarks against us we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business in the event that our license agreements or other similar license arrangements with oems or others are terminated or we are unable to agree upon renewal terms we may be subject to costs and uncertainties of litigation as well as restrictions on our ability to sell aftermarket parts that replicate parts covered by those design patents or trademarks we have filed and may file in the future challenges to oem patents including patents owned by oems with which we have patent license agreements we also may file challenges to oem trademarks to the extent oems are successful in defending their patents or trademarks we could be restricted or prohibited from selling the corresponding aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business also we will likely incur expenses investigating pursuing and defending intellectual property claims 

us customs and border protection has taken the position that certain of our aftermarket parts infringe certain oem trademarks and seized our aftermarket parts as we attempted to import them into the us we have incurred costs and expenses convincing customs and border protection to release the seized goods and in litigation where we sought a determination of noninfringement in the event customs and border protection seizes our products again in the future we may be unsuccessful in obtaining their release and such goods may be subject to forfeiture and other penalties and we would incur legal fees in contesting those seizures 

aftermarket products certifying organizations may revoke the certification of parts that are the subject of the intellectual property disputes lack of certification may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of aftermarket products only if they have been certified by an independent certifying organization 

if the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines or the number of vehicles being repaired declines or the mix of the types of vehicles in the overall vehicle population changes our business could suffer 

our business depends on vehicle accidents mechanical failures and routine maintenance for both the demand for repairs using our products and the supply of recycled remanufactured and refurbished parts to the extent that a relatively higher percentage of damaged vehicles are declared total losses there will be less demand for our products to repair such vehicles in addition our business is impacted by factors that influence the number andor severity of accidents and mechanical failures including but not limited to the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven the ages of drivers the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions the congestion of traffic drivers distracted by electronic equipment the use of alcohol or drugs by drivers the usage rate and effectiveness of accident avoidance systems in new vehicles the reliability of new oem parts and the condition of roadways for example an increase in the acceptance of ridesharing could reduce the number of vehicles on the road additionally an increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the need for mechanical repairs and maintenance to decline as motorists seek alternative transportation options mild weather 

conditions particularly during winter months tend to result in a decrease in vehicle accidents moreover legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones or other electronic devices while driving could lead to a decline in accidents 

systems designed to minimize accident frequency and severity are becoming more prevalent and more technologically sophisticated to the extent oems install or are mandated by law to install accident avoidance systems in their vehicles the number and severity of accidents could decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the average number of new vehicles sold annually has fluctuated from yeartoyear periods of decreased sales could result in a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road and consequently fewer vehicles involved in accidents or in need of mechanical repair or maintenance substantial declines in automotive sales in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition in addition if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of older vehicles on the road insurance companies may find it uneconomical to repair such vehicles or there could be less costly repairs if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of newer vehicles on the road the demand generally for mechanical repairs and maintenance would likely decline due to the newer longerlasting parts in the vehicle population and mechanical failures being covered by oem warranties for the first years of a vehicles life moreover alternative collision and mechanical parts are less likely to be used on newer vehicles our specialty segment depends on sales of pickup trucks sport utility vehicles crossover utility vehicles high performance vehicles and recreational vehicles any reduction in the number of such vehicles in operation will adversely affect demand for our specialty products 

electric vehicles do not have traditional engines transmissions and certain related parts engines and transmissions represent some of our largest revenue generating skus in north america and parts for engines and transmissions represent a significant amount of the revenue of our european operations thus an increase in electric vehicles as a percentage of vehicles sold could have a negative impact on our sales of engines transmissions and other related parts 

fluctuations in the prices of metals and other commodities could adversely affect our financial results 

our recycling operations generate scrap metal and precious metals such as platinum palladium and rhodium as well as other metals that we sell after we dismantle a salvage vehicle for wholesale parts and after vehicles have been processed in our self service retail business the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors and other remaining metals are sold to processors and brokers of metals in addition we receive crush only vehicles or vehicles to be further processed from other companies including oems which we dismantle and which generate scrap metal and other metals in accordance with the guidelines of our agreements with the providing company the prices of scrap and other metals have historically fluctuated sometimes significantly due to market factors in addition buyers may stop purchasing metals entirely due to excess supply to the extent that the prices of metals decrease materially or buyers stop purchasing metals our revenue from such sales will suffer and a writedown of our inventory value could be required 

the cost of our wholesale recycled and our self service retail inventory purchases will change as a result of fluctuating scrap metal and other metals prices in a period of falling metal prices there can be no assurance that our inventory purchasing cost will decrease the same amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal and other metals prices decline and there may be a delay between the scrap metal and other metals price reductions and any inventory cost reductions the prices of steel aluminum and plastics are components of the cost to manufacture products for our aftermarket business if the prices of commodities rise and result in higher costs to us for products we sell we may not be able to pass these higher costs on to our customers 

an adverse change in our relationships with our suppliers disruption to our supply of inventory or the misconduct performance failures or negligence of our third party vendors or service providers could increase our expenses impede our ability to serve our customers or expose us to liability 

our north american business is dependent on a relatively small number of suppliers of aftermarket products a large portion of which are sourced from taiwan our european business also acquires products from asian sources we incur substantial freight costs to import parts from our suppliers many of which are located in asia the cost of freight and shipping containers has risen in 2021 and if the cost of freight and shipping containers continue to rise we might not be able to pass the cost increases on to our customers furthermore although alternative suppliers exist for substantially all aftermarket products distributed by us the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on us until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced manufacturing and providing the relevant products in addition we are subject to disruptions from work stoppages and other labor disputes at port facilities through which we import our inventory we also face the risk that our suppliers could attempt to circumvent us and sell their product directly to our customers consolidation of our suppliers could enhance their ability to distribute products through additional sales channels and thus decrease their reliance on wholesale distributors like us 

moreover our operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad including among other things natural disasters transportation costs and delays political instability currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs import and export controls and other nontariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas as well as the uncertainty regarding future relations between china japan and taiwan for example us customs and border protection have used claims of intellectual property infringement to seize certain of our aftermarket parts as we attempted to import them into the us 

because a substantial volume of our sales involves products manufactured from sheet metal we can be adversely impacted if sheet metal becomes unavailable or is only available at higher prices which we may not be able to pass on to our customers additionally as oems convert to raw materials other than steel it may be more difficult or expensive to source aftermarket parts made with such materials and it may be more difficult for repair shops to work with such materials in the repair process 

most of our salvage and a portion of our self service inventory is obtained from vehicles offered at salvage auctions operated by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the us we do not typically have contracts with the auction companies according to industry analysts a small number of companies control a large percentage of the salvage auction market in the us if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions began competing with us or significantly raised its fees our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers moreover we face competition in the purchase of vehicles from direct competitors rebuilders exporters and other bidders to the extent that the number of bidders increases it may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold for wholesale recycled products some states regulate bidders to help ensure that salvage vehicles are purchased for legal purposes by qualified buyers auction companies have been actively seeking to reduce circumvent or eliminate these regulations which would further increase the number of bidders 

in addition there is a limited supply of salvage vehicles in the us and thus the costs to us of these vehicles could increase over time in some states when a vehicle is deemed a total loss a salvage title is issued whether states issue salvage titles is important to the supply of inventory for the vehicle recycling industry because an increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles currently these titling issues are a matter of state law in 1992 the us congress commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle titling registration and salvage since then legislation has been introduced seeking to establish national uniform requirements in this area including a uniform definition of a salvage vehicle the vehicle recycling industry will generally favor a uniform definition since it will avoid inconsistencies across state lines and will generally favor a definition that expands the number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage however certain interest groups including repair shops and some insurance associations may oppose this type of legislation national legislation has not yet been enacted in this area and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in the future 

we also acquire inventory directly from insurance companies oems and others to the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue these arrangements our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers 

in europe we acquire products from a wide variety of suppliers as vehicle technology changes some parts will become more complex and the design or technology of those parts may be covered by patents or other rights that make it difficult for manufacturers to supply such aftermarket parts to companies such as ours the complexity of the parts may include software or other technical aspects that make it difficult to identify what is wrong with the vehicle more complex parts may be difficult to repair and may require expensive or difficult to obtain software updates limiting our ability to compete with the oems 

we rely on third parties to provide products and services that are integral to our operations if we fail to adequately assess monitor and regulate the performance of our third party vendors and service providers we could be subject to additional risk caused by the misconduct performance failures or negligence of these third parties for example these could include violations of or noncompliance with laws andor regulations governing our business including but not limited to bribery cybersecurity or privacy laws which could lead to sanctions andor fines from governmental agencies our arrangements with third party vendors and service providers may cause us financial and reputational harm if those third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us including their obligations to maintain and protect the security and confidentiality of our information and data or the information and data relating to our customers see the risk factor entitled “ the costs of complying with the requirements of laws pertaining to the privacy and security of personnel information and the potential liability associated with the failure to comply with such laws could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations ” for further information about the security and confidentiality of our information and data further noncompliance with contract terms by our third party vendors or service providers could expose us to liability to other third parties or our employees 

if we determine that our goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired we may incur significant charges to our pretax income 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations in the future our goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of acquisitions goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses deterioration of expected future cash flows or performance increases in our cost of capital adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including modifications that restrict the activities of the acquired business as of december 31 2021 our total goodwill subject to future impairment testing was 45 billion for further discussion of our annual impairment test see goodwill impairment in the critical accounting estimates section of part ii item 7 and intangible assets in note 3 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

except for indefinitelived intangibles we amortize other intangible assets over the assigned useful lives each of which is based upon the expected period to be benefited we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we review finitelived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in the event conditions change that affect our ability to realize the underlying cash flows associated with our intangible assets we may record an impairment charge as of december 31 2021  the value of our other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization was 746 million 

we could be subject to product liability claims and involved in product recalls 

if customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage we could be subject to product liability claims by such customers the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we may become involved in the recall of a product that is determined to be defective more generally a recall involving alternative parts even if we did not sell the recalled products could adversely affect the perceived quality of alternative parts leading to decreased usage of alternative parts the expenses of a recall and the damage to our reputation or the reputation of alternative parts generally could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have agreed to defend and indemnify in certain circumstances insurance companies and customers against claims and damages relating to product liability and product recalls the existence of claims or damages for which we must defend and indemnify these parties could also negatively impact our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may not be able to successfully acquire new businesses or integrate acquisitions and we may not be able to successfully divest certain businesses 

we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms if we do not obtain required antitrust or other regulatory approvals or for other reasons moreover we may not be able to identify acquisition candidates at reasonable prices andor be able to successfully integrate acquisitions 

if we buy a company or a division of a company we may experience difficulty integrating that companys or divisions personnel and operations which could negatively affect our operating results in addition 

• the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 

• customers of the acquired company may decide not to purchase products from us 

• suppliers of the acquired company may decide not to sell products to us 

• we may experience business disruptions as a result of information technology systems conversions 

• we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning treasury management and financial reporting 

• we may be held liable for environmental tax or other risks and liabilities as a result of our acquisitions some of which we may not have discovered during our due diligence 

• we may intentionally assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire which could result in material adverse effects on our business 

• our existing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention 

• we may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated either in the amount or in the time frame that we expect and 

• we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition the issuance of which could involve the imposition of restrictive covenants or be dilutive to our existing stockholders 

for example we have undertaken the 1 lkq europe program to create structural centralization and standardization of key functions to facilitate the operation of the europe segment as a single business this program will present a number of execution challenges the covid19 pandemic impacted certain 1 lkq europe initiatives resulting in minor delays in 2020 

in addition to acquisitions we have divested and will continue to divest certain businesses either because they do not meet our performance standards or for other reasons as a result of a divestment we may not recover the carrying value of our investment in the divested business in addition such divestment transactions require significant management time and attention 

risks relating to our financial structure 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to react to changes in our business 

as of december 31 2021 we had approxi mately 1887 million aggregate principal amount of secured debt outstanding and approximate ly 1194 million of availability under our credit agreement 1263 million of availability reduced by 69 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit in addition we had approximately 853 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured debt outstanding comprised o f €500 million 569 million aggregate principal amount of 3875 senior notes due april 1 2024 the euro notes 2024 and €250 million 284 million of 4125 senior n otes due 2028 the euro notes 2028 and together with the euro notes 2024 the senior notes borrowings under the credit agreement mature in january 2024 

our significant amount of debt and our debt service obligations could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations limit our ability to operate our business and impair our competitive position 

for example our debt and our debt service obligations could 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and general industry conditions including interest rate fluctuations because a portion of our borrowings are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt which would reduce the availability of our cash flow from operations to fund working capital capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry 

• place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt 

• limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements and 

• increase our cost of borrowing 

in addition if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the ability to service such debt would increase 

our senior notes do not impose any limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or protect against certain other types of transactions 

although we are subject to our credit agreement for so long as it remains in effect the indentures governing the senior notes do not restrict the future incurrence of unsecured indebtedness guarantees or other obligations the indentures contain certain limitations on our ability to incur liens on assets and engage in sale and leaseback transactions however these limitations are subject to important exceptions in addition the indentures do not contain many other restrictions including certain restrictions contained in our credit agreement including without limitation making investments prepaying subordinated indebtedness or engaging in transactions with our affiliates 

our credit agreement will permit subject to specified conditions and limitations the incurrence of a significant amount of additional indebtedness under the existing agreement as of december 31 2021 we would have been able to incur an additional 1194 million of indebtedness under our credit agreement 1263 million of availability reduced by 69 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the need to service such debt would increase 

our credit agreement imposes operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

our credit agreement imposes operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions may limit our ability among other things to 

• incur assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness including guarantees thereof outside of our credit agreement 

• pay dividends or make certain other distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness 

• incur liens on assets 

• make certain investments or other restricted payments 

• engage in transactions with affiliates 

• sell certain assets or merge or consolidate with or into other companies 

• guarantee indebtedness and 

• alter the business we conduct 

as a result of these covenants and restrictions we may be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit agreement a default if not waived could result in acceleration of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing credit facilities or it may be on terms that are not acceptable to us 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations if our operating results and 

available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we hope to realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due any future refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations additionally our credit agreement and the indentures that govern our senior notes limit the use of the proceeds from certain dispositions of our assets as a result our credit agreement and our senior notes may prevent us from using the proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all of our debt service obligations 

our future capital needs may require that we seek to refinance our debt or obtain additional debt or equity financing events that could have a negative effect on our business 

we may need to raise additional funds in the future to among other things refinance existing debt fund our existing operations improve or expand our operations respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions from time to time we may raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic alliances or other arrangements funds may not be available or available on terms acceptable to us as a result of different factors including but not limited to turmoil in the credit markets that results in the tightening of credit conditions and current or future regulations applicable to the financial institutions from which we seek financing if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of our common stock if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and further limitations on our operations if we refinance or restructure our debt we may incur charges to write off the unamortized portion of deferred debt issuance costs from a previous financing or we may incur charges related to hedge ineffectiveness from our interest rate swap obligations there are restrictions in the indenture that governs the euro notes 2024 and euro notes 2028 on our ability to refinance such notes prior to january 1 2024 and april 1 2023 respectively we could refinance the notes through open market purchases subject to a limitation in our credit agreement on the amount of such purchases if we fail to raise capital when needed our business may be negatively affected 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly and could affect the value of our senior notes 

certain borrowings under our credit agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness would correspondingly decrease moreover changes in market interest rates could affect the trading value of the senior notes because of reforms relating to the use of the london interbank offered rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate and the move toward risk free rates we recently amended our credit facility to provide that loans denominated in euros will use the european money markets institute as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate swingline and revolving loans denominated in pound sterling will use the sterling overnight index average sonia and loans denominated in swiss francs will use the swiss average rate overnight as administered by six swiss exchange ag we expect to amend our credit facility in the future to incorporate other risk free rates for those loans that still bear interest at libor plus the applicable margin as the syndicated loan market continues to transition away from libor the consequences of a move away from libor cannot be entirely predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt 

repayment of our indebtedness including our senior notes is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries 

we are a holding company and repayment of our senior notes will be dependent upon cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are borrowers or guarantors of the indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness including the senior notes each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries and under certain circumstances distributions from our subsidiaries may be subject to taxes that reduce the amount of such distributions available to us while the indentures governing the senior notes limit the ability of our subsidiaries to restrict the payment of dividends or to restrict other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness including the senior notes 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our senior notes 

credit ratings have an important effect on our cost of capital credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include among other items our results of operations business decisions that we make their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading we believe our current credit ratings enhance our ability to borrow funds at favorable rates a downgrade in our current credit rating from a rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facilities a downgrade could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our senior notes preventing a holder from selling the senior notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affecting our ability to issue new notes in the future or incur other indebtedness upon favorable terms 

the right to receive payments on the senior notes is effectively junior to those lenders who have a security interest in our assets 

our obligations under our senior notes and our guarantors’ obligations under their guarantees of the senior notes are unsecured but our and each coborrower’s obligations under our credit agreement and each guarantor’s obligations under their respective guarantees of the credit agreement are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our domestic tangible and intangible assets including the stock of most of our whollyowned united states subsidiaries and the stock of certain of our nonunited states subsidiaries if we are declared bankrupt or insolvent or if we default under our credit agreement the lenders could declare all of the funds borrowed thereunder together with accrued interest immediately due and payable if we were unable to repay such indebtedness the lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets to the exclusion of holders of our senior notes even if an event of default exists under the applicable indenture governing the senior notes furthermore if the lenders foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any subsidiary guarantor under our senior notes then that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the senior notes automatically and immediately upon such sale in any such event because the senior notes are not secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in subsidiary guarantors it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from which claims by holders of the senior notes could be satisfied or if any assets remained they might be insufficient to satisfy claims fully as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 1887 million aggregate principal amount of secured debt outstanding and approximately 1194 million of availability under our credit agreement 1263 million of availability reduced by 69 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit 

united states federal and state statutes allow courts under specific circumstances to void the senior notes and the guarantees subordinate claims in respect of the senior notes and the guarantees and require holders of the senior notes to return payments received from us or the guarantors 

our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that are obligors under the credit agreement guarantee the obligations under our senior notes the issuance of our senior notes and the issuance of the guarantees by the guarantors may be subject to review under state and federal laws if a bankruptcy liquidation or reorganization case or a lawsuit including in circumstances in which bankruptcy is not involved were commenced at some future date by or on behalf of our unpaid creditors or the unpaid creditors of a guarantor under the federal bankruptcy laws of the united states and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws a court may avoid or otherwise decline to enforce the senior notes or a guarantor’s guarantee or may subordinate the senior notes or such guarantee to our or the applicable guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness while the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction a court might do so if it found that when indebtedness under the senior notes was issued or when the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee or in some jurisdictions when payments became due under the senior notes or such guarantee the issuer or the applicable guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and 

• was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence 

• was engaged in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital or 

• intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature 

a court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the senior notes or such guarantee if we or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the senior notes thus if the guarantees were legally challenged any guarantee could be subject to the claim that since the guarantee was incurred for our benefit and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration if a court were to void the issuance of the senior notes or any guarantee a holder of the senior notes would no longer have any claim against us or the applicable 

guarantor in the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred a holder of the senior notes may not receive any repayment on the senior notes further the avoidance of the senior notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt which could result in acceleration of that debt the measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred generally however an issuer or a guarantor as applicable would be considered insolvent if 

• the sum of its debts including contingent liabilities was greater than the fair value of its assets 

• the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts including contingent liabilities as they become absolute and mature or 

• it could not pay its debts as they become due 

a court might also void the senior notes or a guarantee without regard to the above factors if the court found that the senior notes were incurred or issued or the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee with actual intent to hinder delay or defraud its creditors we cannot give any assurance as to what standard a court would apply in determining whether we or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard or regardless of the standard that a court uses that it would not determine that we or a guarantor were indeed insolvent on that date that any payments to the holders of the senior notes including under the guarantees did not constitute preferences fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds or that the issuance of the senior notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to our or any guarantor’s other debt in addition any payment by us or a guarantor pursuant to the senior notes or its guarantee could be avoided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors and accordingly the court might direct holders of the senior notes to repay any amounts already received from us or such guarantor among other things under us bankruptcy law any payment by us pursuant to the senior notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time we or such guarantor were found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a oneyear period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside party and such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such party would have received in a distribution under the bankruptcy code in a hypothetical chapter 7 case although each guarantee contains a “savings clause” intended to limit the subsidiary guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its subsidiary guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer this provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect any subsidiary guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law in that regard in official committee of unsecured creditors of tousa inc v citicorp north america inc  the united states bankruptcy court in the southern district of florida held that a savings clause similar to the savings clause included in our indentures was unenforceable as a result the subsidiary guarantees were found to be fraudulent conveyances the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit subsequently affirmed the liability findings of the bankruptcy court without ruling directly on the enforceability of savings clauses generally if the decision of the bankruptcy court in tousa were followed by other courts the risk that the guarantees would be deemed fraudulent conveyances would be significantly increased 

to the extent a court avoids the senior notes or any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or holds the senior notes or any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason the holders of the senior notes would cease to have any direct claim against us or the applicable guarantor if a court were to take this action our or the applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy our or the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities if any and might not be applied to the payment of the senior notes sufficient funds to repay the senior notes may not be available from other sources including the remaining guarantors if any in addition the euro notes 2024 and the related guarantees may be subject to avoidance under the laws of foreign jurisdictions including italy and czech republic to the extent that we the issuer of the euro notes 2024 or any of the guarantors as applicable were to be the subject of an insolvency or related proceeding in such jurisdictions 

not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our credit agreement or our senior notes and the assets of our nonguarantor subsidiaries may not be available to make payments on such obligations 

not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the credit agreement euro notes 2024 and euro notes 2028 in the event that any nonguarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent liquidates reorganizes dissolves or otherwise winds up holders of its indebtedness and its trade creditors generally will be entitled to payment on their claims from the assets of that subsidiary before any of those assets are made available to the lenders under the credit agreement or the holders of the senior notes consequently claims in respect of the credit agreement and the senior notes are structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors of such instruments including trade payables and any claims of third party holders of preferred equity interests if any in our nonguarantor subsidiaries as of the most recent practicable date our subsidiaries that are not borrowers under or do not guarantee the credit agreement represented approx imately 50 and 34 o f our total revenue 

and operating income respectively in addition these nonguarantor subsidiaries represented approximat ely 53 and 62 of our total assets and total liabilities respectively excluding in each case intercompany amounts as of the same date our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the credit agreement had approximately 2000 million of outstanding indebtedness which includes 1085 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities by foreign subsidiaries that are borrowers under these facilities the group of subsidiaries that does not guarantee the euro notes 2024 is substantially similar to the group that does not guarantee the euro notes 2028 except that in addition to the issuer of the euro no tes 2024 there are four subsidiaries in the group that do not guarantee the euro notes 2028 that guarantee the euro notes 2024 

we may not be able to repurchase the senior notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer 

upon a change of control as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes the holders of the senior notes will have the right to require us to offer to purchase all of the senior notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest such a change of control would also be an event of default under our credit agreement in order to obtain sufficient funds to pay amounts due under the credit agreement and the purchase price of the outstanding senior notes we expect that we would have to refinance our indebtedness we cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance our indebtedness on reasonable terms if at all our failure to offer to purchase all outstanding senior notes or to purchase all validly tendered senior notes would be an event of default under the indentures governing the senior notes such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other debt our other debt also may contain restrictions or repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the indentures governing the senior notes 

the definition of change of control in the indentures governing the senior notes includes a phrase relating to the sale of “all or substantially all” of our assets there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law accordingly the ability of a holder of senior notes to require us to repurchase its senior notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain 

in addition in certain circumstances as specified in the indentures governing the senior notes if we sell certain assets we will be required to either prepay secured debt of the issuer or guarantors of the senior notes prepay debt of nonguarantor whollyowned subsidiaries reinvest the sale proceeds in other assets or commence an asset sale offer as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes pursuant to which we will be obligated to purchase certain senior notes at a price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest with the proceeds we receive from such asset sales our other debt may contain restrictions that would limit or prohibit us from completing any such asset sale offer in particular our credit agreement contains provisions that require us upon the sale of certain assets to either apply all of the proceeds from such asset sale to the prepayment of the term loan amounts due under the credit agreement or to reinvest such proceeds in real estate equipment or tangible assets if we chose to prepay the term loan obligations instead of reinvesting in assets the mandatory prepayment obligations under the credit agreement will be effectively senior to our obligations to make an asset sale offer with respect to the senior notes under the terms of the indentures governing the senior notes 

key terms of the senior notes will be suspended if the notes achieve investment grade ratings and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing 

many of the covenants in the indentures governing the senior notes will be suspended if the senior notes are rated investment grade by standard  poor’s and moody’s provided at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing including those covenants that restrict among other things our ability to pay dividends incur liens and to enter into certain other transactions there can be no assurance that the senior notes will ever be rated investment grade however suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force although provisions under our other debt like the credit agreement may continue to restrict us from engaging in these transactions and the effects of any such transactions will be permitted to remain in place even if the senior notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade 

the liquidity and market value of the senior notes may change due to a variety of factors 

the liquidity of any trading market in the senior notes and the market price quoted for the senior notes may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for these types of securities changes in interest rates changes in our ratings and changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industries generally 

the amount and frequency of our share repurchases and dividend payments may fluctuate 

the amount timing and execution of our share repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes such as operational spending capital spending acquisitions or repayment of debt changes in cash flows tax laws and our share price could also impact our share repurchase program and other capital activities additionally decisions to return capital to shareholders including through our repurchase program or the issuance of dividends on our common stock remain subject to determination of our board of directors that any such activity is in the best interests of our shareholders and is in compliance with all applicable laws and contractual obligations 

legal and regulatory risks 

existing or new laws and regulations or changes to enforcement or interpretation of existing laws or regulations may prohibit restrict or burden the sale of aftermarket recycled refurbished or remanufactured products 

many states have introduced or passed laws that limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair these laws include requirements relating to consumer disclosure vehicle owner’s consent regarding the use of aftermarket products in the repair process and the requirement to have aftermarket products certified by an independent testing organization additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future if additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business 

certain organizations test the quality and safety of vehicle replacement products if these organizations decide not to test a particular vehicle product or in the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product such events could adversely affect our business 

some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags in addition laws relating to the regulation of parts affecting vehicle emissions such as california’s proposition 65 may impact the ability of our specialty segment to sell certain accessory products these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled products the passage of legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on our business additionally congress could enact federal legislation restricting the use of aftermarket or recycled automotive products used in the course of vehicle repairs in europe the motor vehicle block exemption regulations mvber regulate the competition rules on automotive spare parts the 2012 mvber are due to expire in may 2023 the current indications are that the 2012 mvber will be extended for 5 years with additional guidance to be provided by the eu commission in a supplementary guidance regarding new technology and software provided by oems the new eu proposals with respect to mvber will be proposed for consultation in mid2022 

the federal trade commission has issued guides that regulate the use of certain terms such as “rebuilt” or “remanufactured” in connection with the sale of automotive parts restrictions on the products we are able to sell and on the marketing of such products could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters 

we are subject to various environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators or lose our operating permits we could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials we have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements we cannot assure you however that we will at all times be in complete compliance with such requirements 

we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future 

under certain environmental laws we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at or migration to or from our or our predecessors past or present facilities and at independent waste disposal sites these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or was not responsible for the release of such hazardous substances many of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use that may have involved hazardous materials as a result some of our properties may be contaminated some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination these environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of treats or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties or successors to such owners or operators for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 

contamination resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release storage transportation or disposal of gasoline motor oil antifreeze transmission fluid chlorofluorocarbons from air conditioners other hazardous materials or metals such as aluminum cadmium chromium lead and mercury contamination from the refurbishment of chrome plated bumpers can occur from the release of the plating material contamination can migrate onsite or offsite which can increase the risk and the amount of any potential liability 

when we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process we analyze the risks and when appropriate perform further environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination furthermore where appropriate we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters in the event we discover new information or if laws change we may incur significant liabilities which may exceed our reserves 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by legal regulatory or market responses to global climate change 

growing concern over climate change has led policy makers in the us to consider the enactment of legislative and regulatory proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions such laws if enacted are likely to impact our business in a number of ways for example significant increases in fuel economy requirements new federal or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or new federal or state incentive programs that may be imposed on vehicles and automobile fuels could adversely affect demand for vehicles annual miles driven or the products we sell we may not be able to accurately predict prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations with respect to electric vehicles and other technologies that minimize emissions compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers our inability to appropriately respond to such changes could adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

moreover the perspectives of our customers suppliers stockholders employees community partners regulatory agencies and other stakeholders regarding climate change are evolving these stakeholders are increasingly requesting disclosures and actions relating to not only climate change but other environmental and social matters and corporate governance practices the increase in costs to comply with such evolving expectations including any rules or regulations resulting from these evolving expectations as well as any risk of noncompliance could adversely impact us 

our amended and restated bylaws provide that the courts in the state of delaware are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees 

our amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if the court of chancery does not have jurisdiction another court of the state of delaware or if no court of the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware shall be the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings 

• any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; 

• any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; 

• any action asserting a claim against us arising under the delaware general corporation law our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; 

• any action asserting a claim governed by the internalaffairs doctrine and 

• any action to interpret apply enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws 

the choice of forum provision in our bylaws does not apply to claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act or the securities act or any claim with respect to which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction 

although we believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers due to among other possible factors increased costs of such lawsuits and limitations on the ability to bring claims in a judicial forum that the plaintiffs may consider more favorable alternatively if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

our effective tax rate could materially increase as a consequence of various factors including interpretations and administrative guidance in regard to the tax act defined below us andor international tax legislation mix of earnings by jurisdiction and us and foreign jurisdictional audits 

we are a us based multinational company subject to income taxes in the us and a number of foreign jurisdictions therefore we are subject to changes in tax laws in each of these jurisdictions including as a result of changes proposed by the new us administration and such changes could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate and cash flows 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act among other things the tax act reduced the us statutory corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 additionally beginning in 2018 the tax act imposed a regime of taxation on foreign subsidiary earnings global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” and on certain related party payments base erosion antiabuse tax “beat” other important changes potentially material to our operations included the full expensing of certain assets placed into service after september 27 2017 the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction and additional limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation finally as part of the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system the tax act imposed a onetime transition tax on the deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 

many nonus jurisdictions are implementing tax legislation based upon recommendations made by the organization for economic cooperation and development in connection with its base erosion and profit shifting study as well as certain antitaxavoidance initiatives advanced by the european commission the outcome of these legislative developments could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate and cash flows 

the tax rates applicable in the jurisdictions within which we operate vary widely therefore our effective tax rate may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of our earnings by jurisdiction 

we are also subject to ongoing audits of our income tax returns in various jurisdictions both in the us and internationally while we believe that our tax positions will be sustained the outcomes of such audits could result in the assessment of additional taxes which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results 

if significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on products or materials we import or any related countermeasures are taken by countries to which we export products our revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed 

the us has imposed tariffs on certain materials imported into the us from china and announced additional tariffs on other goods from china and other countries moreover countermeasures have been taken by other countries in retaliation for the usimposed tariffs the tariffs cover products and materials that we import and the countermeasures may affect products we export the effects currently are not material however depending on the breadth of products and materials ultimately affected by and the duration of the tariffs and countermeasures our financial results may be materially harmed in addition countries may impose other restrictions on the importation of products 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits 

our operating subsidiaries in our salvage self service and refurbishing operations must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations when we develop or acquire a new facility we must seek the approval of state and local units of government governmental agencies may resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling or refurbishing facility in their communities there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold 

general risks 

our employees are important to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives if we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel which could harm our business in addition we have experienced wage inflation in the jurisdictions in which we operate an inability to respond to these inflationary pressures could impact our ability to retain key employees or we may experience increased costs due to difficulties related to hiring and retaining employees 

we operate in foreign jurisdictions which exposes us to foreign exchange and other risks 

we have operations in north america europe and taiwan and we may expand our operations in the countries in which we do business and into other countries our foreign operations expose us to additional risks associated with international business which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition including import and export requirements and compliance with anticorruption laws such as the uk bribery act 2010 and the foreign corrupt practices act we also incur costs in currencies other than our functional currencies in some of the countries in which we operate we are thus subject to foreign exchange exposure to the extent that we operate in different currencies as well as exposure to foreign tax and other foreign and domestic laws in addition certain countries in which we operate have a higher level of political instability and criminal activity than the us that could affect our operations and the ability to maintain our supply of products 

our business may be adversely affected by union activities and labor and employment laws 

certain of our employees are represented by labor unions and other employee representative bodies and work under collective bargaining or similar agreements which are subject to periodic renegotiation from time to time there have been efforts to organize additional portions of our workforce and those efforts can be expected to continue in addition legislators and government agencies could adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that could make it significantly easier for unionization efforts to be successful also we may in the future be subject to strikes or work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disruptions and disputes additional unionization efforts new collective bargaining or similar agreements and work stoppages could materially increase our costs and reduce revenue and could limit our flexibility in terms of work schedules reductions in force and other operational matters 

we also are subject to laws and regulations that govern such matters as minimum wage overtime and other working conditions some of these laws are technical in nature and could be subject to interpretation by government agencies and courts different than our interpretations efforts to comply with existing laws changes to such laws and newlyenacted laws may increase our labor costs and limit our flexibility if we were found not to be in compliance with such laws we could be subject to fines penalties and liabilities to our employees or government agencies in addition efforts to better protect local markets from foreign workers and decisions of countries to withdraw from treaties and joint economic areas may lead to increased restrictions on the free movement of people and labor and may limit our ability to place key personnel where they could best serve our needs 

we rely on information technology and communication systems in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business 

in the ordinary course of business we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are provided by or leased from third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans these information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals breaches due to employee error or malfeasance disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware terminations of business relationships by third party service providers power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures terrorist acts natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events involving us or involving the third parties with whom we do business could compromise our or the third parties networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation any of which could adversely affect our business in addition as security threats continue to evolve we will likely need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems 

in the event that we decide to switch providers or to implement upgrades or replacements to our own systems we may be unsuccessful in the development of our own systems or we may underestimate the costs and expenses of switching providers or developing and implementing our own systems also our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system which period could extend longer than we anticipated we are in the midst of a systems conversion project for our european businesses which will be subject to all of these risks 

the costs of complying with the requirements of laws pertaining to the privacy and security of personal information and the potential liability associated with the failure to comply with such laws could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we collect personally identifiable information pii and other data as part of our business processes and operations the legislative and regulatory framework relating to privacy and data protection is rapidly evolving worldwide and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future this data is subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations many foreign countries and governmental bodies including the european union canada and other jurisdictions where we conduct business have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of pii and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions that are more restrictive than those in the us additionally the european union adopted the general data protection regulation gdpr that imposes more stringent data protection requirements for processors and controllers of personal data including expanded disclosures about how pii is to be used limitations on retention of pii mandatory data breach notification requirements possible restrictions on cross border transfers of pii and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities the gdpr provides severe penalties for noncompliance in addition stricter laws in this area are being enacted in certain states in the us and in other countries and more jurisdictions are likely to follow this trend 

any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection issues even if unfounded or comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations including at newlyacquired companies could result in additional cost and liability to us result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions give rise to civil litigation result in damage to our reputation including the loss of trust by our customers and employees inhibit sales and otherwise adversely affect our business we also may be subject to these adverse effects if other parties with whom we do business including lenders suppliers consultants and advisors violate applicable laws or contractual obligations or suffer a security breach 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our operations the function of our computer systems andor the availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in the breakdown of our distribution center systems closure of our distribution centers or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory through our system on a timely basis this may affect our ability to serve our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the us or into the other countries in which we operate and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks and other vehicles our business could be harmed 

we use a fleet of trucks and other vehicles to deliver the majority of the products we sell we are subject to the risks associated with providing delivery services including inclement weather disruptions in the transportation infrastructure governmental regulation availability and price of fuel liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance insurance premium increases and ability to hire drivers in addition our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may lose the right to operate at key locations 

we lease most of the properties at which we conduct our businesses at the end of a lease term we must negotiate a renewal exercise a purchase option to the extent we have that right or find a new location there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate renewals on terms acceptable to us or that we will find a suitable alternative location especially with respect to our salvage operations which have characteristics that are often not attractive to landlords local governments or neighbors in such cases we may lose the right to operate at key locations 

activist investors could cause us to incur substantial costs divert management’s attention and have an adverse effect on our business 

we have in the past received and we may in the future be subject to proposals by activist investors urging us to take certain corporate actions activist investor activities could cause our business to be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and other demands by activist investors can be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees for example we have retained and may in the future be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist investor matters including legal financial and communications advisors the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results campaigns by activist investors to effect changes at publiclytraded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short term investor value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company perceived uncertainties as to our future direction strategy or leadership that arise as a consequence of activist investor initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities harm our ability to attract new investors employees and business partners and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation

during 2021 we received notices of alleged violations of federal stormwater regulations from epa region 3 regarding facilities in maryland and pennsylvania and region 4 regarding facilities in alabama georgia and tennessee in response to the region 3 notice we negotiated an administrative order on consent “aoc” to further investigate and if necessary make improvements at the identified facilities we negotiated a second aoc requiring payment of 130000 in penalties which was paid in december 2021 in response to the region 4 notice we negotiated an aoc to further investigate and if necessary make improvements at the identified facilities region 4 has advised us that it intends to seek penalties but we have not yet received a demand we do not expect that any proposed penalty will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in addition we are from time to time subject to various claims and lawsuits incidental to our business in the opinion of management currently outstanding claims and suits will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

acquisitions and investments 

since our inception in 1998 we have pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions through 2018 our acquisition strategy was focused on consolidation to build scale in fragmented markets across north america and europe we targeted companies that were market leaders expanded our geographic presence and enhanced our ability to provide a wide array of vehicle products through our distribution network in the last few years we have shifted our focus from larger transactions to tuckin acquisitions that target high synergies andor add critical capabilities additionally we have made investments in various businesses to advance our strategic objectives 

during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we acquired various immaterial businesses across our north america europe and specialty segments 

sources of revenue 

we report our revenue in two categories i parts and services and ii other our parts revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products including replacement parts components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty products and accessories to improve the performance functionality and appearance of vehicles our service revenue is generated primarily from the sale of servicetype warranties fees for admission to our self service yards and diagnostic and repair services during the year ended december 31 2021 parts and services revenue represented approximately 93 of our consolidated revenue revenue from other sources includes scrap and other metals including precious metals  platinum palladium and rhodium sales bulk sales to mechanical manufacturers including cores and sales of aluminum ingots and sows from our furnace operations other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold see note 4 revenue recognition to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information related to our sources of revenue 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances historically we have not made significant changes to the methods for determining these estimates as our actual results have not differed materially from our estimates we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and related assumptions will change materially in the foreseeable future however actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below for additional information related to significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note 3 summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

goodwill impairment 

description 

goodwill is obtained through business acquisitions and recorded at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill is not amortized but instead tested for impairment annually or sooner if events indicate that an impairment may exist in performing this test we compare the carrying value of the asset to its fair value to derive the fair value for our reporting units which carry goodwill we consider the use of various valuation techniques with the primary technique being an income approach via a discounted cash flow method and another being a market approach via a guideline public company method if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the estimated fair value the asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recognized in performing the test for impairment of goodwill goodwill is allocated to the reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination 

judgments and uncertainties 

determining whether impairment indicators exist and estimating fair values as part of impairment testing require significant judgment estimating the fair values of our reporting units which have goodwill requires the use of significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy as part of applying the discounted cash flow method and guideline public company method we use significant assumptions which include sales growth operating margins discount rates perpetual growth rates and valuation multiples which consider our budgets business plans economic projections and marketplace data 

sensitivity of estimate to change 

we have not made material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill during the last three years the assumptions used to assess impairment consider historical trends macroeconomic conditions and projections consistent with the company’s operating strategy changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the assessment of fair value which could result in material impairment losses during fiscal year 2021 we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for our goodwill no impairment charges were recorded as a result of the testing as the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit exceeded the calculated carrying value a 10 decline in projected cash flows or a 10 increase in the discount rate would not have resulted in an impairment to goodwill

1 lkq europe program 

we have undertaken the 1 lkq europe program to create structural centralization and standardization of key functions to facilitate the operation of the europe segment as a single business under this multiyear program we expect to recognize the following 

• restructuring expenses — nonrecurring costs resulting directly from the implementation of the 1 lkq europe program from which the business will derive no ongoing benefit see note 5 restructuring and acquisition related expenses” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further details 

• transformation expenses — period costs incurred to execute the 1 lkq europe program that are expected to contribute to ongoing benefits to the business eg noncapitalizable implementation costs related to a common erp system these expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses 

• transformation capital expenditures — capitalizable costs for longlived assets such as software and facilities that directly relate to the execution of the 1 lkq europe program 

costs related to the 1 lkq europe program incurred to date are reflected in selling general and administrative expenses restructuring and acquisition related expenses and purchases of property plant and equipment in our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k beginning in the second half of march 2020 management delayed certain projects under the 1 lkq europe program to reduce expenses and preserve capital in response to the covid19 pandemic based on our expectations in the second quarter of 2020 that the impacts on our business from covid19 had stabilized we restarted the program in july 2020 with substantially the same initiatives and projects as prior to the pandemic while certain projects were delayed as a result of the covid19 pandemic such as our procurement initiatives and the new headquarters in switzerland we also accelerated certain projects such as the integration of previously acquired networks and sharing resources across lkq europe we have continued the project on schedule after the restart we completed the organizational design and implementation projects in june 2021 with the remaining projects scheduled to be completed by 2024 during the year ended december 31 2021 we incurred 37 million in costs across all three categories noted above we expect that costs of the program reflecting all three categories noted above will range between 100 million and 130 million between 2022 and the projected program completion date in 2024 in the future we may also identify additional initiatives and projects under the 1 lkq europe program that may result in additional expenditures although we are currently unable to estimate the range of charges for such potential future initiatives and projects we expect the transformation and restructuring expenses will be entirely funded by the improved trade working capital initiatives across our europe segment 

covid19 impact on our operations 

in late february 2020 the italian government began placing restrictions on activity as a result of the covid19 outbreak sales volumes fell as fewer cars were on the road and less maintenance activity was performed while our italian operation is an important part of our european business it represented approximately 10 of the segment’s revenue in 2019 and thus the disruption did not have a material impact on the company by midmarch the covid19 impact began spreading across the rest of the geographies where we operate at a very rapid pace governments adopted aggressive restrictions on the operation of nonessential businesses and personal movement which reduced miles driven and collisions while our businesses were deemed essential in most jurisdictions in which we operate the change in behavior driven by the covid19 restrictions negatively impacted our sales volume our organic parts and services revenue declined by 168 45 and 52 in the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 respectively relative to the comparable prior year periods we showed improvement in the third quarter of 2020 as governments gradually lifted restrictions for nonessential businesses and personal movement however in the fourth quarter of 2020 revenue declined as certain jurisdictions put restrictions back into place as anticipated april 2020 experienced the most negative revenue impact with organic parts and services revenue on a per day basis down 303 compared to the prior year period as movement restrictions lessened in may and june of 2020 we experienced organic parts and services revenue declines on a per day basis of 132 and 73 respectively compared to the prior year periods however the pace of improvement flattened into the third quarter of 2020 as the increasing level of covid19 cases especially in the united states slowed the recovery during the third quarter of 2020 organic parts and services revenue declined by 45 compared to the prior year period a small improvement from the june 2020 decline of 73 on a per day 

basis during the fourth quarter of 2020 organic parts and services revenue declined by 61 on a per day basis and gradually worsened during the quarter with a decline of 72 on a per day basis in december during the first quarter of 2021 organic parts and services revenue increased by 22 on a per day basis despite the continued covid19 impact on economic activity in the us and europe during the second quarter of 2021 organic parts and services revenue increased by 211 on a per day basis reflecting the low prior year comparable figure owing to covid19 and the gradual recovery in mobility during the third quarter of 2021 the recovery continued with organic parts and services revenue increasing by 40 during the fourth quarter of 2021 organic parts and services revenue increased by 73 on a per day basis since the start of the pandemic our revenue has been impacted to varying degrees depending on the segment with north america experiencing the most negative impact due to the decrease in miles driven and collision activity europe was also negatively affected by mobility restrictions and reduced miles driven but has experienced a quicker recovery than north america and reached its 2019 revenue level in the fourth quarter of 2021 after seeing year over year decreases early in the pandemic specialty revenue has grown due to favorable trends in recreational vehicle activity and online sales we expect consolidated parts and services revenue to grow organically in future periods but the level of the year over year increase in revenue will depend on among other factors the extent of covid19 related restrictions across the geographies in which we operate as strategies to address the virus evolve the pace of recovery in miles driven and access to inventory which has been constrained with supply chain issues 

our top priority is the health and safety of our employees customers and the communities in which we operate we are using all reasonable efforts to follow governmental instructions and safety guidelines with respect to the operations of our facilities we implemented protocols across our business units designed to help ensure the health and safety of our employees customers and communities including but not limited to restricting access to and enhancing cleaning and disinfecting protocols at our facilities encouraging vaccination of our employees use of personal protective equipment adhering to social distancing guidelines instituting remote work arrangements for many of our employees and restricting travel we are monitoring developments related to variant status vaccination levels and governmental standards and have adjusted our practices where appropriate to comply with the latest guidance 

recognizing the demand changes in the first quarter of 2020 we took action in all of our business units to reduce our cost structure these actions included but were not limited to employee furloughs and reductions in force decreases in hours and overtime lowering compensation for salaried employees a hiring freeze elimination of temporary labor route consolidation deferral of projects and temporary branch closures in the second quarter of 2020 these cost actions contributed to a reduction of approximately 18 in quarterly selling general and administrative expenses compared to our first quarter 2020 run rate since then we have been able to sustain a portion of these cost benefits as revenue has increased some of the costs that were reduced as a result of covid19 remained at a lower level the management team has implemented productivity initiatives to create lower cost structures going forward which has contributed to profitability reported in 2020 and 2021 inflationary pressures around wages and freight experienced in 2021 drove expenses higher which partially offset some of the prior cost savings initiatives 

we pursued certain financial assistance and relief programs that were available to us from governments in europe and canada primarily in the form of grants to offset personnel expenses during the year ended december 31 2021 we qualified for 16 million of assistance we received 52 million of government assistance in 2020 with the largest portion coming in the second quarter we currently do not anticipate qualifying for significant additional assistance in 2022 

we also emphasized the preservation of capital in 2020 with a deferral of growth driven capital projects reductions in inventory orders more active monitoring of customer receivables and terms income and value added tax payment deferrals the majority of which were paid during the third quarter of 2020 and suspension of our share buyback program which was reinstated during the fourth quarter of 2020 this focus was successful as we improved our liquidity position at december 31 2020 by approximately 1000 million relative to march 31 2020 while managing through the disruption caused by the pandemic beginning in late 2020 and continuing in 2021 we returned to our stated capital allocation strategy with an emphasis on internal investments in capital expenditures and inventory tuckin acquisitions and share repurchases while also issuing the companys first dividend in the fourth quarter of 2021 

in each quarter of 2020 we prepared forecasts of future revenues profits and cash flows to use in multiple analyses including the interim goodwill impairment test other impairment tests of longlived assets assessments of the recoverability of inventory determination of customer and supplier rebate balances calculation of the annual effective tax rate and evaluations of the realizability of deferred tax assets actual results showed an improving trend with profitability in the second third and fourth quarters all exceeding our prior forecast prepared in the first quarter of 2020 we continued to assess covid19 developments and the potential impacts on our business in 2021 and will continue to do so in 2022 and update the applicable analyses as necessary 

as the economic impact of the pandemic is dependent on variables that are difficult to project and in many cases are outside of our control it is possible that the estimates underlying our analyses may change materially in future periods this is particularly the case because it appears that the prevalence of the virus outbreak fluctuates depending on various factors including the development of variants and the level of economic and social activity and vaccination status in a region 

see the results of operations and liquidity sections for further detail on our year over year trends 

key performance indicators 

we believe that organic revenue growth segment ebitda and free cash flow are key performance indicators for our business segment ebitda is our key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker free cash flow is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “nongaap” 

• organic revenue growth  we define organic revenue growth as total revenue growth from continuing operations excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures ie revenue generated from the date of acquisition to the first anniversary of that acquisition net of reduced revenue due to the disposal of businesses and foreign currency movements ie impact of translating revenue at prior period exchange rates organic revenue growth includes incremental sales from both existing and new ie opened within the last twelve months locations and is derived from expanding business with existing customers securing new customers and offering additional products and services we believe that organic revenue growth is a key performance indicator as this statistic measures our ability to serve and grow our customer base successfully 

• segment ebitda  refer to note 15 segment and geographic information” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a description of the calculation of segment ebitda we believe that segment ebitda provides useful information to evaluate our segment profitability by focusing on the indicators of ongoing operational results 

• free cash flow  we calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property plant and equipment free cash flow provides insight into our liquidity and provides useful information to management and investors concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements to make strategic acquisitions to repurchase stock and to pay dividends 

these three key performance indicators are used as targets in determining incentive compensation at various levels of the organization including senior management by using these performance measures we attempt to motivate a balanced approach to the business that rewards growth profitability and cash flow generation in a manner that enhances our longterm prospects

results of operations—segment reporting 

we have four operating segments wholesale – north america europe specialty and self service our wholesale – north america and self service operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment north america because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services customers and methods of distribution therefore we present three reportable segments north america europe and specialty 

we have presented the growth of our revenue and profitability in our operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis the constant currency presentation which is a nongaap measure excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth and profitability consistent with how we evaluate our performance as this statistic removes the translation impact of exchange rate fluctuations which are outside of our control and do not reflect our operational performance constant currency revenue and segment ebitda results are calculated by translating prior year revenue and segment ebitda in local currency using the current years currency conversion rate this nongaap financial measure has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under us gaap our use of this term may vary from the use of similarlytitled measures by other issuers due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation in addition not all companies that report revenue or profitability on a constant currency basis calculate such measures in the same manner as we do and accordingly our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarlynamed measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies 

the following table presents our financial performance including third party revenue total revenue and segment ebitda by reportable segment for the periods indicated in thousands 



the key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker our chief executive officer is segment ebitda segment ebitda includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment corporate general and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage with shared expenses apportioned based on the segments percentage of consolidated revenue we calculate segment ebitda as ebitda excluding restructuring and acquisition related expenses which includes restructuring expenses recorded in cost of goods sold change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities other gains and losses related to acquisitions equity method investments or divestitures equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries equity investment fair value adjustments and impairment charges ebitda which is the basis for segment ebitda is calculated as net income attributable to lkq stockholders excluding discontinued operations and discontinued noncontrolling interest depreciation amortization interest which includes gains and losses on debt extinguishment and income tax expense see note 15 segment and geographic information to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a reconciliation of total segment ebitda to net income

north america 

third party revenue  the following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our north america segment in thousands 



1 parts and services organic revenue increased 56 64 on a per day basis for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year period primarily driven by pricing and growth from recycled and remanufactured major mechanical parts and aftermarket automotive glass products while mobility statistics have improved relative to 2020 aftermarket collision parts revenue was roughly flat yearoveryear due to the constraints on availability of parts caused by supply chain issues in 2021 until these issues are resolved we expect to see a negative effect on aftermarket fill rates across the sector that will impact revenue growth rates 

2 the 276 million year over year organic increase in other revenue is primarily related to i a 134 million increase in revenue from scrap steel due to higher prices ii an 81 million increase in revenue from precious metals platinum palladium and rhodium primarily due to higher prices and iii a 61 million increase in revenue from other scrap and cores primarily related to higher prices 

segment ebitda segment ebitda increased 166 million or 213 for the year ended december 31 2021 despite the impact of two fewer selling days compared to the prior year period this increase is attributable to higher precious metals and scrap steel prices margin initiatives rightsizing actions and the favorable effect from the revenue recovery compared to the prior year when the covid19 impact was more severe these were partially offset by negative impacts due to aftermarket fill rates and inflationary increases in costs increases in precious metals prices contributed an estimated 60 million in segment ebitda improvement relative to the year ended december 31 2020 additionally net sequential increases in scrap steel prices in our salvage and self service operations had a 42 million favorable impact on segment ebitda for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to a 16 million favorable impact for the year ended december 31 2020 this favorable impact for the year ended december 31 2021 resulted from the increase in scrap steel prices between the date we purchased a vehicle which influences the price we pay for a vehicle and the date we scrapped a vehicle which influences the price we receive for scrapping a vehicle we estimate that precious metals and scrap steel pricing had a favorable effect of 10 on segment ebitda margin relative to the comparable prior year period 

the following table summarizes the changes in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue in our north america segment 



1 the increase in gross margin primarily reflected favorable impacts from our wholesale operations wholesale operations gross margin was favorable primarily due to the positive impact of higher precious metals and scrap steel prices pricing initiatives and cost reductions from operational efficiencies and rightsizing efforts compared to the prior year input costs for our wholesale operations have risen with i inflationary pressures impacting product and freight costs in aftermarket and ii limited supply combined with heightened competition at auctions contributing to higher salvage costs we are adjusting prices dynamically to address input cost increases and market conditions such as inventory availability and 

demand and in some cases we experienced a margin benefit in 2021 as higher prices were enacted ahead of turning the higher cost inventory 

2 the decrease in segment operating expense as a percentage of revenue on a per day basis primarily reflects i a favorable impact of 04 from personnel expenses related to headcount reductions operational efficiencies and a positive leverage effect mostly related to the increase in other revenue partially offset by inflationary cost increases and increased incentive compensation expense and ii a positive leverage effect of 04 from facility expenses which are largely fixed 

3 the unfavorable impact in other expense net and net income attributable to continuing noncontrolling interest of 02 was primarily related to higher insurance proceeds received for the year ended december 31 2020 

europe 

third party revenue  the following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our europe segment in thousands 



1 parts and services organic revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 62 as the negative pandemic effect on volume in 2020 was more severe than in 2021 not all regions were impacted by the pandemic at the same time and to the same degree as in 2020 and the easing of lockdown measures has varied across the continent in 2021 these conditions created a different growth profile for each of our european businesses while most of our businesses reported year over year growth central and eastern europe the uk and benelux reported the largest incremental increases for the year ended december 31 2021 

2 acquisition and divestiture related decline for the year ended december 31 2021 was primarily as a result of the disposals of a noncore telecommunications operation in germany in the second quarter of 2020 and five additional smaller disposals in 2021 and 2020 

3 compared to the prior year exchange rates increased our revenue growth by 251 million or 46 primarily due to the weaker us dollar against the euro pound sterling and czech koruna for the year ended december 31 2021 relative to the prior year period 

segment ebitda  segment ebitda increased 190 million or 445 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year period our europe segment ebitda included a positive year over year impact of 20 million related to the translation of local currency results into us dollars at higher exchange rates than those experienced for the year ended december 31 2020 on a constant currency basis ie excluding the translation impact segment ebitda increased by 170 million or 398 compared to the prior year refer to the foreign currency impact discussion within the results of operations–consolidated section above for further detail regarding foreign currency impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2021 



1 the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to a favorable impact of 14 as a result of net price increases implemented in response to inflationary pressures that are impacting product and freight costs and other margin improvement initiatives related to procurement additionally there was a 02 benefit from the disposal of noncore operations in 2020 

2 the decrease in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects favorable impacts of i 04 from bad debt expense due to customers improved solvency and an increase in reserve in the prior year related to the covid19 pandemic ii 03 from freight vehicle and fuel expenses due to higher internet and mail order sales in the prior year which have higher freight costs and iii several individually immaterial factors that had a favorable impact of 03 in the aggregate these were partially offset by personnel costs that had an unfavorable impact of 02 compared to the prior year due to government grants received in the prior year to cover employee costs in countries such as the uk and germany a lesser amount was received in 2021 and increased incentive compensation that was partially offset by a favorable leverage effect and headcount reductions 

specialty 

third party revenue  the following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our specialty segment in thousands 



1 parts and services organic revenue increased 202 211 on a per day basis for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year despite two fewer selling days  the organic increase was primarily due to strong demand for our products across all channels of our business we believe the revenue growth was driven by our competitive advantage with our delivery service teams that enabled us to keep up with the strong demand and have more available inventory than our competitors 

2 acquisition related growth for 2021 reflected revenue from our acquisitions of four specialty businesses since the beginning of 2020 through the oneyear anniversary of the acquisition dates 

segment ebitda  segment ebitda increased 60 million or 372 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased revenue as noted above and expanded margin as discussed below 

the following table summarizes the changes in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue in our specialty segment 



1 the increase in gross margin primarily reflects lower discounting to recover increased input costs and to a lesser extent favorable product and channel mix 

2 the decrease in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects a favorable impact of i 03 in personnel costs partially offset by ii an unfavorable impact of 02 due to increased incentive compensation 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes liquidity data as of the dates indicated in thousands 



1 debt amounts reflect the gross values to be repaid excluding debt issuance costs of 12 million 26 million and 30 million as of december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

2 debt amounts reflect the gross values to be repaid excluding debt issuance costs of immaterial amounts as of december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

3 capacity under credit facilities includes our revolving credit facilities and our receivables securitization facility through july 30 2021 at which time the facility was terminated availability under credit facilities is reduced by our outstanding letters of credit 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through both internal development and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our credit facilities we utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures with the excess amounts going towards funding acquisitions paying down outstanding debt paying dividends or repurchasing our common stock as we have pursued acquisitions as part of our historical growth strategy our cash flows from operations have not always been sufficient to cover our investing activities to fund our acquisitions we have accessed various forms of debt financing including revolving credit facilities senior notes and a receivables securitization facility terminated on july 30 2021 

as of december 31 2021 we had debt outstanding and additional available sources of financing as follows 

• senior secured credit facilities maturing in january 2024 composed of 3150 million in revolving credit  1887 million outstanding at december 31 2021 bearing interest at variable rates with availability reduced by 69 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit 

• euro notes 2024 totaling 569 million €500 million maturing in april 2024 and bearing interest at a 3875 fixed rate 

• euro notes 2028 totaling 284 million €250 million maturing in april 2028 and bearing interest at a 4125 fixed rate 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 1194 million available under our credit facilities combined with 274 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2021 we had approximately 1468 million in available liquidity a decrease of 1390 million from our available liquidity as of december 31 2020 as a result of the following activity  on april 1 2021 we redeemed the €750 million euro notes 2026 with proceeds from borrowings on our revolving credit facility and cash on hand resulting in a decrease in available liquidity compared to december 31 2020  additionally in the second quarter of 2021 we used free cash flow generated in our domestic operations and borrowings on our revolving credit facility to repay all of our term loan 319 million also we terminated our 110 million receivables securitization facility effective july 30 2021 with these transactions we reduced our overall liquidity by utilizing available capacity under the revolving credit facility and reducing the overall facility size we believe our future cash flow needs can be supported by a smaller credit facility so we redeemed the euro notes 2026 and eliminated the term loan using funds from the revolving credit facility which in turn will lower our interest expense and nonusage fees since december 31 2019 we have lowered the debt balance by 1248 million 

we believe that our current liquidity and cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements to support our liquidity following the onset of the covid19 pandemic we focused on preserving cash during the expected period of reduced demand our action plan to strengthen our liquidity position included a deferral of growth driven capital projects reductions in inventory orders more active monitoring of customer receivables and terms income and value added tax deferrals and suspension of our share buyback program in 

addition to the cost saving measures discussed in the covid19 impact on our operations section above given our success in strengthening our liquidity position as of september 30 2020 we recommenced our share buyback program during the fourth quarter of 2020 and we returned to our stated capital allocation strategy our 2022 plan includes further spending to rebuild inventory levels support growth driven capital projects and complete strategic acquisitions 

beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 we expanded our capital allocation strategy to include the payment of dividends as an additional mechanism to return value to our stockholders on october 26 2021 the board of directors of lkq declared a cash dividend to stockholders the quarterly cash dividend of 025 per share of common stock was paid on december 2 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on november 11 2021 for an aggregate payout of 73 million which is reflected as a financing cash outflow on february 15 2022 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 025 per share of common stock payable on march 24 2022 to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 3 2022 we believe that our future cash flow generation will permit us to continue paying dividends in future periods however the timing amount and frequency of such future dividends will be subject to approval by our board of directors and based on considerations of capital availability compliance with covenants in our credit facilities and senior note indentures and various other factors many of which are outside of our control additionally due to the rapidly evolving global situation it is not possible to predict whether unanticipated consequences of the covid19 pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity and capital resources negatively in the future or alter our capital allocation strategy 

with 1468 million of total liquidity as of december 31 2021 and 35 million of current maturities we have access to funds to meet our near term commitments even if the pandemic effect extends longer than our current expectations we have a surplus of current assets over current liabilities which further reduces the risk of short term cash shortfalls 

our total liquidity inclu des availability under our senior secured credit facility which includes the two financial maintenance covenants presented below our required debt covenants and our actual ratios with respect to those covenants as calculated per the credit agreement as of december 31 2021 



the terms net leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio used in the credit agreement are specifically calculated per the credit agreement and differ in specified ways from comparable us gaap or common usage terms 

our credit agreement contains customary covenants that impose limitations and conditions on our ability to enter into certain transactions the credit agreement also contains financial and affirmative covenants including limitations on our net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our credit agreement as of december 31 2021 

the indentures relating to our euro notes d o not include financial maintenance covenants and the indentures will not restrict our ability to draw funds on the credit facility the indentures do not prohibit amendments to the financial covenants under the credit facility as needed 

in the long term while we believe that we have adequate capacity under our existing credit facilities from time to time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements such as i our november 2018 amendment to our senior secured credit facility and ii the issuance of the €750 million senior notes due 2026 and €250 million senior notes due 2028 the euro notes 202628 in april 2018 related to the stahlgruber acquisition there can be no assurance that additional funding or refinancing of our credit facilities if needed will be available on terms attractive to us or at all furthermore any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants or higher interest costs our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

beginning in 2019 a number of our european suppliers began participating in a supply chain financing initiative in select countries under which they may sell their accounts receivable to the participating financial institutions allowing us to extend payment terms which in turn improves our operating cash flows the initiative allows our suppliers to monetize their receivables prior to their payment date subject to payment of a discount we expect more suppliers will begin participating in our european supply chain financing initiative in 2022 f inancial institutions participate in the supply chain financing initiative on an uncommitted basis and can cease purchasing receivables from our suppliers at any time the initiative is at the sole discretion of both the supplier and the financial institution on terms that are negotiated between them in the future if the 

financial institutions did not continue to purchase receivables from our suppliers under the initiative the participating vendors may need to renegotiate their payment terms with us which in turn could cause our borrowings under our revolving credit facility to increase all outstanding payments owed under the initiative to the participating financial institutions are recorded within accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets 

borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at variable rates which are tied to various indices depending on the currency and the duration of the borrowing plus an applicable margin rate that is subject to change quarterly based on our reported leverage ratio as detailed in note 9 longterm obligations to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k certain of the available interest rates were modified in november in connection with the phase out of libor borrowings in us dollars will continue to accrue interest at libor until a replacement rate is specified which is expected to occur prior to june 2023 we do not expect the change in benchmark rates will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or liquidity 

we have held interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates on a portion of our credit agreement borrowings with the effect of fixing the interest rates on the respective notional amounts in addition from time to time we hold currency swaps that contain an interest rate swap component and a foreign currency forward contract component that when combined with related intercompany financing arrangements effectively convert variable rate us dollardenominated borrowings into fixed rate eurodenominated borrowings these derivative transactions are described in note 10 derivative instruments and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k as of december 31 2021 we did not have any of these types of contracts outstanding and the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement was 11 at december 31 2021 including our senior notes our overall weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 20 at december 31 2021 

cash interest payments were 76 million for the year ended december 31 2021 including interest payments on our euro notes 2024 and euro notes 2028 as well as the interest owed when we settled the euro notes 2026 interest payments on our euro notes 2024 and euro notes 2028 are made in april and october 

w e had outstanding credit agreement borrowings of 1887 million and 967 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively of these amounts there were no current maturities as of december 31 2021 and current maturities of 18 million at december 31 2020 

as of december 31 2021 the company had cash and cash equivalents of 274 million  of which 211 million was held by foreign subsidiaries in general it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and that position has not changed following the enactment of the tax act and the related imposition of the transition tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 we believe that we have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our financial obligations in the us without repatriating our foreign earnings we may from time to time choose to selectively repatriate foreign earnings if doing so supports our financing or liquidity objectives distributions of dividends from our foreign subsidiaries if any would be generally exempt from further us taxation either as a result of the 100 participation exemption under the tax act or due to the previous taxation of foreign earnings under the transition tax and the gilti regime 

the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds we normally pay for aftermarket product purchases on standard payment terms or at the time of shipment depending on the manufacturer and the negotiated payment terms we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles 

the following table sets forth a summary of our aftermarket and manufactured inventory procurement for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 in thousands 



1 inventory purchases across the north america segment have increased for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year period due to the low base as we scaled back buying in recognition of demand changes in 2020 we are rebuilding our inventory levels after decreases in 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic however they did not reach our desired levels for the year ended december 31 2021 due to ocean freight driven delays in shipping 

2 the increase in inventory purchases in our europe segment included an increase of 142 million attributable to the increase in the value of the euro and to a lesser extent the pound sterling for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year period on a constant currency basis inventory purchases increased compared to 2020 primarily due to the low base as we scaled back buying in recognition of demand changes in 2020 however we did not reach our desired levels for the year ended december 31 2021 due to ocean freight driven delays in shipping 

3 the increase in inventory purchases in the specialty segment was primarily due to required restocking to keep up with the high demand for our products 

as shown in the table above while inventory procurement increased for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to december 31 2020 procurement is still below prepandemic levels for the north america and europe segments 

the following table sets forth a summary of our global wholesale salvage and self service procurement of vehicles for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 in thousands 



salvage purchases in 2021 increased relative to the prior year due to reduced buying in the prior year to reflect lower demand during the covid19 pandemic self service vehicle purchases in 2021 declined due to i increased competition in the market due to high costs of precious metals and scrap steel and ii the elimination of underperforming locations in accordance with the 2020 global restructuring program 

we expect to increase inventory purchases in 2022 to support the service and fill rate requirements of our businesses based on the revenue trend and expectations for full year 2022 including normal seasonality as supply chain challenges in 2021 deferred a portion of the inventory build to 2022 although if supply chain challenges continue our ability to increase inventory purchases to the desired level could be affected 

the following table summarizes the components of the yearoveryear decrease in cash provided by operating activities in thousands 



1 refer to the results of operations – consolidated section for further information on the increase in operating income 

2 cash payments related to income taxes increased due to an increase in pretax income and the timing of estimated tax payments 

3 decrease in cash payments for interest is due to lower outstanding borrowings and the payoff of the euro notes 2026 in april 2021 with proceeds from lower interest rate debt 

4 cash flows related to our primary working capital accounts can be volatile as the purchases payments and collections can be timed differently from period to period 

• receivables net was a 110 million greater outflow in 2021 primarily due to an increase in revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020  which translated to larger net outflows in the north america segment of 25 million and in the europe segment of 95 million we had a smaller cash outflow in the specialty segment of 10 million 

• inventories represented 668 million in incremental cash outflows for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 the change is primarily attributable to increased inventory purchases in the current year as a result of recovering demand from prior year pandemic lows and strategic inventory purchases to curb the impacts of supply chain constraints 

• accounts payable produced 347 million in highe r cash inflows primarily due to higher accounts payable balances in the north america segment of 196 million and in the specialty segment of 20 million due to timing of payments and in the europe segment of 131 million co mpared to the prior year period as a result of timing of payments and benefits from extended payment terms including through our supply chain financing initiatives 

5 reflects a number of individually insignificant fluctuations in cash paid for other operating activities

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in 

• foreign exchange rates 

• interest rates and 

• commodity prices 

foreign exchange rates 

foreign currency fluctuations may impact the financial results we report for the portions of our business that operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar our operations outside of the us represented 494 and 505 of our revenue during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively an increase or decrease in the strength of the us dollar against these currencies by 10 would result in a 4 9 change in our consolidated revenue and a 34 change in our operating income for the year ended december 31 2021 see our results of operations discussion in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our year over year results 

additionally we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket products from foreign countries primarily in europe and asia to the extent that our inventory purchases are not denominated in the functional currency of the purchasing location we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in several of our operations we purchase inventory from manufacturers in taiwan in us dollars which exposes us to fluctuations in the relationship between the local 

functional currency and the us dollar as well as fluctuations between the us dollar and the taiwan dollar we hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations related to a portion of inventory purchases in our europe operations but the notional amount and fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2021 were immaterial we do not currently attempt to hedge foreign currency exposure related to our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in our north america operations and we may not be able to pass on any resulting price increases to our customers 

to the extent that we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations related to nonfunctional currency denominated financing transactions we may hedge the exposure through the use of foreign currency forward contracts as of december 31 2021 we did not hold foreign currency forward contracts related to nonfunctional currency denominated debt 

other than with respect to a portion of our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases and from time to time certain financing transactions we do not hold derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency risk our net investment in foreign operations is partially hedged by the foreign currency denominated borrowings we use to fund foreign acquisitions however our ability to use foreign currency denominated borrowings to finance our foreign operations may be limited based on local tax laws we have elected not to hedge the foreign currency risk related to the interest payments on foreign third party borrowings as we generate cash flows in the local currencies that can be used to fund debt payments as of december 31 2021 we had outstanding borrowings of €500 million under our euro notes 2024 and €250 million under our eu ro notes 2028 and €940 million and swedish krona sek 145 million un der our revolving credit facilities as of december 31 2020 we had outstanding borrowings of €500 million under our euro notes 2024 and €10 billion under our euro notes 202628 we had no foreign borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 

interest rates 

our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facilities where interest rates are tied to the prime rate libor canadian dollar offered rate euro interbank offered rate sonia or swiss average rate overnight therefore we implemented a policy to manage our exposure to variable interest rates on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt instruments through the use of interest rate swap contracts these contracts convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt matching the currency effective dates and maturity dates to specific debt instruments we designate our interest rate swap contracts as cash flow hedges and net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swap contracts are included as adjustments to interest expense 

we had none of our variable rate debt under our credit facilities at fixed rates at december 31 2021 compared to 87 at december 31 2020 see note 9 longterm obligations and note 10 derivative instruments and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

at december 31 2021 we had approximately 1887 million of variable rate debt that was not hedged using sensitivity analysis a 100 basis point movement in interest rates would change interest expense by 19 million over the next twelve months 

commodity prices 

we are exposed to market risk related to price fluctuations in scrap metal and other metals including precious metals such as platinum palladium and rhodium market prices of these metals affect the amount that we pay for our inventory and the revenue that we generate from sales of these metals as both our revenue and costs are affected by the price fluctuations we have a natural hedge against the changes however there is typically a lag between the effect on our revenue from metal price fluctuations and inventory cost changes and there is no guarantee that the vehicle costs will decrease or increase at the same rate as the metals prices therefore we can experience positive or negative gross margin effects in periods of rising or falling metals prices particularly when such prices move rapidly additionally if market prices were to change at a greater rate than our vehicle acquisition costs we could experience a positive or negative effect on our operating margin the average of scrap metal prices for 2021 increased 83 compared to the average for 2020 the average prices of rhodium platinum and palladium increased by 77 22 and 7 respectively for the year ended december 31 2021 over the averages for the year ended december 31 2020

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

we are implementing a new erp system across our european business units using a phased approach as a result of this implementation certain internal controls over financial reporting have been automated modified or implemented to address the new control environment associated with this erp while we believe this new system will strengthen our internal controls there are inherent risks in implementing any new system and we will continue to evaluate these control changes as part of our assessment of internal control over financial reporting

further information regarding our recent acquisitions is included in note 2 business combinations to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

since 2017 we have divested eight businesses resulting from i the ongoing rationalization of our asset base by divesting certain noncore andor low margin businesses and ii mandatory divestiture requirements due to certain acquisitions two of these divestitures have been reported as discontinued operations 

strategy 

our mission is to be the leading global valueadded distributor of vehicle parts and accessories by offering our customers the most comprehensive available and costeffective selection of part solutions while building strong partnerships with our employees and the communities in which we operate beginning in 2019 we reduced our focus on growth primarily through acquisitions and emphasized operational excellence through a strategy of organically taking market share with leading inventory breadth and depth high fulfillment rates delivery reliability and customer service 

we have four primary strategic pillars to build economic value growth through diversified product offerings expanding our footprint adaptation to evolving technology and rationalization of our asset base to enhance margins and return on capital we believe our distribution network with a broad inventory of quality collision and mechanical repair products and specialty vehicle aftermarket products high fulfillment rates and superior customer service provide us with a competitive advantage to execute our strategy we focus on a number of key areas including 

• continue to build and develop our extensive distribution network we have invested significant capital to develop a network of alternative and specialty vehicle parts facilities across our operating segments our ability to move inventory throughout our distribution networks increases the availability of our products and allows us to fill a high percentage of our customers’ requests in order to expand our distribution network we may seek to enter new markets through geographic expansion improve penetration through organic development tuck in acquisitions and by building critical capabilities such as diagnostic service offerings we believe our north america segment has the largest distribution network of vehicle parts and accessories for the automotive collision repair market in north america in our europe segment we are implementing a business transformation a similar strategy to our north america operations by establishing a paneuropean organization through the integration of the various acquisitions we currently have operations in over 20 different european countries which we believe represents the broadest and largest footprint in the aftermarket industry in europe on a global basis we operate approximately 1600 facilities 

• broad product offering the breadth and depth of our inventory across our operating segments reinforces our ability to provide a “onestop” solution for our customers’ alternative vehicle replacement maintenance diagnostic services and specialty vehicle product needs

covid19 impact 

the covid19 pandemic and the resulting governmental actions taken to control the virus have impacted and are expected to continue to impact our business in 2020 and into 2021 the effects include but are not limited to a reduction in demand for our products and services liquidity challenges for certain of our customers and suppliers and organizational changes such as personnel reductions and route consolidation driven by cost actions to mitigate the actual and expected revenue decline the ultimate impact of covid19 on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments including the severity and duration of the pandemic and the related impact on the global economy which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time for further discussion regarding the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business and financial results see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

north america segment 

our north america segment is composed of wholesale operations which consists of aftermarket and salvage operations and self service retail operations 

wholesale operations 

inventory 

our wholesale operations in north america sell five product types aftermarket oem recycled oem remanufactured oem refurbished and to a lesser extent new oem parts to professional collision and mechanical vehicle repair businesses our principal aftermarket product types consist of those most frequently damaged in collisions including bumper covers automotive body panels lights and automotive glass products such as windshields platinum plus is our exclusive product line offered under the keystone brand of aftermarket products we also developed a product line called “value line” for more value conscious often selfpay consumers certain of our products are certified by an independent organization the certified automotive parts association “capa” capa is an association that evaluates the quality of aftermarket collision replacement products compared to oem collision replacement products our salvage products include both mechanical and collision parts including engines transmissions door assemblies sheet metal products such as trunk lids fenders and hoods lights and bumper assemblies additionally by way of two acquisitions in 2019 we entered the diagnostics and repair services business which we expect to grow in the coming years as the number of technological components in vehicles increases in january 2021 the diagnostic and repair services acquisitions were combined into a single brand known as elitek vehicle services 

the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from independent manufacturers and distributors located primarily in north america and asia principally taiwan in 2020 approximately 44 of our aftermarket purchases were made from our top 5 vendors with our largest vendor providing approximately 13 of our annual inventory purchases for the north america segment we believe we are one of the largest customers of each of these suppliers outside of this group no other supplier provided more than 5 of our supply of aftermarket products in 2020 we purchased approximately 42 of our aftermarket products in 2020 directly from manufacturers in taiwan and other asian countries approximately 55 of our aftermarket products were purchased from vendors located in the us however we believe the majority of these products were manufactured in taiwan mexico or other foreign countries 

within our wholesale operations we focus our procurement on products that are in the most demand based on a number of factors such as historical sales records of vehicles by model and year customer requests and projections of future supply and demand trends because lead times may be 40 days or more on imported aftermarket products sales volumes and instock inventory are important factors in the procurement process 

we procure recycled products for our wholesale operations by acquiring total loss vehicles typically sold at regional salvage auctions and then dismantling and inventorying the parts the availability and pricing of the salvage vehicles we procure for our wholesale recycled products operations may be impacted by a variety of factors including the production level of new vehicles and the percentage of damaged vehicles declared total losses our bidding specialists are equipped with a proprietary software application that allows them to compare the vehicles at salvage auctions against our current inventory 

levels historical demand and recent average selling prices to arrive at an estimated maximum bid additionally we are embedding artificial intelligence technology into our salvage procurement software to assist in the procurement decision making process reducing the amount of labor and human error in the process 

information technology systems 

in our aftermarket operations we use a third party enterprise management system and other third party software packages for an electronic data interchange tool and ecommerce tools to enhance our online businesstobusiness initiatives  orderkeystonecom and keyless 

our wholesale recycled product locations in north america operate an internallydeveloped proprietary enterprise management system called lkqx we believe that the use of a single system across a majority of our wholesale recycled product operations helps facilitate the sales process allows for continued implementation of standard operating procedures and improves training efficiency employee transferability access to our national inventory database management reporting and data storage the system also supports an electronic exchange process for identifying and locating parts at other select recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock 

we also use other third party software packages for both businesses to leverage the centralized data and information that a single system provides such as a data warehouse to conduct enhanced analytics and reporting and an integrated budgeting system 

scrap and other materials 

our salvage operations generate scrap metal and other materials that we sell to metals recyclers vehicles that have been dismantled for recycled products and crush only endoflife vehicles acquired from other companies are typically crushed using equipment on site in other cases we will hire mobile crushing equipment to crush the vehicles before they are transported to shredders and scrap metal processors damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products including wheels we also extract and sell the precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts such as catalytic converters 

customers 

we sell our products to wholesale customers that include collision and mechanical repair shops and new and used car dealerships as well as to retail customers the majority of these customers tend to be individuallyowned small businesses although the number of independent and dealeroperated collision repair facilities has declined over the last decade as regional or national multiple shop operators mso have increased their geographic presence through consolidation 

automobile insurance companies affect the demand for our collision products while insurance companies do not pay for our products directly they ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount as a result insurance companies often influence the types of products used in a repair the use of our alternative products instead of new oem products provides a direct benefit to insurance companies by lowering the cost of repairs by often decreasing the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and by providing a replacement product that is of high quality and comparable performance to the part replaced 

our sales personnel are encouraged to promote lkq to customers as a “onestop shop” by offering comparable options from our other product lines if the desired part is not in stock to support these efforts our sales staff has access to both recycled and aftermarket sales systems to encourage cross selling 

to better serve our customers we take a consolidated approach to the electronic sale of wholesale products in our north america segment a full suite of ecommerce services is available to approved partners that helps us improve order accuracy reduce return rate and better fit our customer workflow using these services in coordination with our partners products can be searched priced and ordered without leaving the customers own operating systems

we have a distribution network of warehouses and cross dock facilities which allows us to develop and maintain our service levels with local repair shops while providing industry leading fulfillment rates that are made possible by our nationwide presence our delivery fleet utilizes a third party software provider to optimize delivery routes and to track the progress of delivery vehicles throughout their runs this third party software connects into each of our wholesale systems to allow a single interface for our management team to have a single delivery to our customer regardless of the product line or operating system our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries as required by our customers using drivers who routinely deliver to the same customers our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network we operate a delivery fleet of mediumsized trucks and smaller trucks and vans 

which deliver multiple product types on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs and improve customer service 

competition 

we consider all suppliers of vehicle collision and mechanical products to be competitors including aftermarket suppliers recycling businesses refurbishing operations parts remanufacturers oems and internetbased suppliers we compete with alternative parts distributors on the basis of our nationwide distribution system our product lines and inventory availability customer service our relationships with insurance companies and to a lesser extent price we compete with oems primarily on the basis of price and to a lesser extent on service and product quality we do not consider retail chains that focus on the doityourself market to be our direct competitors since many of our wholesale product sales are influenced by insurance companies who ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount rather than the end user and there is limited overlap in the products that we sell 

self service operations 

our self service retail operations most of which operate under the name “lkq pick your part” allow consumers to come directly to the yard to pick parts off of salvage vehicles in addition to revenue from the sale of parts core scrap steel and other metals we charge a nominal admission fee to access the property 

inventory 

we acquire inventory for our self service retail product operations from a variety of sources including but not limited to towing companies vehicle auctions the general public municipality sales insurance carriers and charitable organizations we procure salvage vehicles for our self service retail product operations that are generally older and priced lower than the salvage vehicles we purchase for our wholesale recycled product operations vehicles are delivered to our locations by the seller or we arrange for transportation once on our property minimal labor is required to process the vehicle other than removing the battery fluids refrigerants catalytic converters and hazardous materials the extracted fluids are stored in bulk and subsequently sold to recyclers vehicles are then placed in the yard for customers to remove parts in our self service business availability of a specific part will depend on which vehicles are currently at the site and to what extent parts may have been previously sold we usually keep a vehicle at our facility for 30 to 120 days depending on the capacity of the yard and size of the market before it is crushed and sold to scrap metal processors 

scrap and other materials 

our self service operations generate scrap metal alloys and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that we no longer make available to the public and crush only vehicles acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products including wheels we also extract and sell the precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts such as catalytic converters 

customers 

the customers of our self service yards are frequently doityourself mechanics small independent repair shops servicing older vehicles auto rebuilders and resellers the scrap from the vehicle hulks when not processed by us is sold to metals recyclers with whom we may also compete when procuring salvage vehicles for our operations 

competition 

there are competitors operating self service businesses in all of the markets in which we operate in some markets there are numerous competitors often operating in close proximity to our operations we try to differentiate our business by the quality of the inventory and the size and cleanliness of the property we also differentiate our business from our competitors through our app which allows customers to receive daily push notifications when vehicles in which they have identified an interest are placed into their favorite yards in addition to allowing customers to see our available inventory the app also allows customers to input search parameters including for specific parts and the year make and model of the vehicle to identify the population of vehicles that might be available from which to pull compatible parts we do not consider retail chains that focus on the doityourself market to be our direct competitors as there is limited overlap in the products that we sell 

europe segment 

our europe segment operates in over 20 countries and was built on four key acquisitions ecp 2011 sator 2013 rhiag 2016 and stahlgruber 2018 additionally in 2014 we expanded our european segment to include wholesale recycling operations through our acquisition of a business with salvage and vehicle repair facilities in sweden and norway and in 2016 we acquired an equity investment in mekonomen ab mekonomen the leading independent car parts distributor in the 

nordic region of europe mekonomen is independent of our existing european operations but we have identified areas where the companies can work together in a mutually beneficial manner primarily related to procurement and category management 

1 lkq europe 

our european strategy facilitated through our 1 lkq europe program is to leverage the strengths of acquired businesses reduce procurement costs by consolidating and streamlining our product offerings and combine an integrated organization driving for functional excellence with the necessary technology linking our business processes with our customers and suppliers as part of our 1 lkq europe program we are integrating our european operations as we optimize purchasing warehousing systems logistics and backoffice functions and align our private label products across the segment under the 1 lkq europe program we are reorganizing our noncustomerfacing teams and support systems through various projects including the implementation of a common erp platform rationalization of our product portfolio the creation of a europe head office in switzerland and the establishment of a shared service center in poland while certain projects were delayed as a result of the covid19 pandemic such as our procurement initiatives and the new headquarters in switzerland we also accelerated certain projects such as the integration of previously acquired networks and sharing resources across lkq europe we are targeting to complete the organizational design and implementation projects by the middle of 2021 with the remaining projects scheduled to be completed by 2024 

inventory 

our inventory is primarily composed of mechanical aftermarket parts for the repair of vehicles 3 to 15 years old our top selling products include brake pads discs and sensors clutches electrical products such as spark plugs and batteries steering and suspension products filters and oil and automotive fluids we currently have over 900000 unique part numbers our goal is to reduce the complexity of our product portfolio reduce the number of parts offered and reduce the number of suppliers we have phased out or replaced more than 150 brands in the past couple of years we believe that more than 70 of our product portfolio existing at the start of the program in 2019 could be reviewed for possible reduction 

in 2020 our top supplier represented 8 of our aftermarket inventory purchases for our europe segment no other suppliers comprised more than 5 of our purchases during 2020 in 2020 we purchased 94 of our products from companies in europe in 2020 72 and 17 of our total inventory purchases were made in euros and pounds sterling respectively as part of our 1 lkq europe initiatives we are expanding the distribution of our private label products our key strategic private label products are optimal era and mpm oils 

in our nordic operations we purchase severely damaged or total loss vehicles from insurance companies which are transferred to our dismantling facilities or sold to other third party dismantlers 

information technology systems 

our aftermarket operations in europe use various information technology it systems our systems are complex and are designed to perform a variety of tasks depending on the market including but not limited to customer orders inventory management warehouse and logistics and financial reporting certain of our it systems can interface with the respective it systems of our repair shop customers which enables our customers to identify and order the part required for the repair as part of our 1 lkq europe strategy to create an integrated european company we initiated a multiyear program to develop and implement a european wide erp system which will reduce the number of it systems we operate a pilot for the erp system was successfully deployed in our operating unit in switzerland in the first quarter of 2020 after a pause during 2020 due to the disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic the implementation of the erp program has been resumed and will next be tested and installed at our italian operating unit 

customers 

we primarily operate a twostep ie direct sales to repair shop customers distribution model in europe although certain of our operations such as in italy the netherlands germany switzerland and hungary operate partially a threestep ie sales to distributors who in turn sell to repair shop customers distribution model in our twostep operations we sell the majority of our products to commercial customers primarily consisting of professional repairers including both independent mechanical repair shops and collision repair shops in our threestep operations we sell products to wholesale distributors or jobbers in addition to our sales to repair shops and wholesale distributors we generate a portion of our revenue through sales to retail customers from ecommerce platforms and from counter sales at the branch locations 

distribution 

our european operations employ a distribution model in which inventory is stored at national or international distribution centers or regional hubs with fast moving product stored at branch locations the large distribution centers regularly restock the smaller branches and hubs and hold slower moving items helping us to improve fulfillment rates product is moved through the distribution network on our trucks vans or via common carrier we are building a new central distribution center in the netherlands similar to our central distribution centers in tamworth england and sulzbachrosenberg germany 

that will allow us to consolidate multiple regional distribution centers we believe that our distribution network is larger than those of any of our principal competitors in europe 

competition 

we view all suppliers of replacement repair products as our competitors including other alternative parts suppliers and oems and their dealer networks we face significant competition in many markets where even smaller competitors can compete on price and service and the oems compete via ties to brand loyalty of the consumer while also remaining competitive on price service and availability we believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other alternative parts suppliers primarily through our distribution network efficient stock management systems and proprietary technology which allows us to deliver our products quickly as well as through our product lines and inventory availability pricing and service reliability 

specialty segment 

our specialty operating segment was formed in 2014 with our acquisition of keystone specialty a leading distributor and marketer of specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories in north america our specialty operations reach most major markets in the us and canada and serve the following six product segments rv truck and offroad towing speed and performance wheels tires and performance handling and miscellaneous accessories in 2017 we acquired warn industries inc warn a leading designer manufacturer and marketer of high performance vehicle equipment and accessories the acquisition of warn expanded our presence in the specialty market and created viable points of entry into related markets 

inventory   

the specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories we distribute and raw materials for products we manufacture are purchased from suppliers located primarily in the us canada and china our top selling products are rv appliances  air conditioners towing hitches truck bed covers vehicle protection products cargo management products and wheels tires  suspension products specialty aftermarket suppliers are typically small to mediumsized independent businesses that focus on a narrow product or market niche due to the highly fragmented supplier base for specialty vehicle aftermarket products we have limited supplier concentration in 2020 approximately 13 of our specialty vehicle aftermarket purchases were made from our top two suppliers to this segment with our largest supplier providing approximately 8 of our annual inventory purchases no other suppliers comprised more than 5 of our purchases during 2020 with our 2017 acquisition of warn we have internal capabilities to manufacture and source aftermarket winches hoists and bumpers 

most of our specialty operations utilize an internally developed inventory management and order entry system that interfaces with third party software systems for accounting transaction processing data analytics and reporting 

customers 

overall the specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and accessories market serves a fragmented customer base composed of rv and specialty automotive dealers installers jobbers builders parts chains and mailorder businesses our customers are principally small independent businesses these customers depend on us to provide a broad range of products rapid delivery marketing support and technical assistance in addition to traditional customers in recent years we have increased sales to several large parts and accessory online retailers our specialty segment also operates retail stores in northeast pennsylvania 

we promote our products to customers through marketing programs which include i catalogs advertising sponsorships and promotional activities ii product level marketing and merchandising support and iii online and digital marketing initiatives we stage inperson andor virtual trade shows across the us which provide an opportunity to improve sales through the showcasing of new and innovative products from our vendors to our customers

distribution 

our specialty segment operations employ a hubandspoke distribution model that enables us to transport products from our primary distribution centers to our noninventory stocking cross docks some of which are colocated with our north america wholesale operations and provide distribution points to key regional markets and synergies with our existing infrastructure we believe this provides added value to our customers through a broader product offering and more efficient distribution process we use our delivery routes to provide delivery and returns of our products directly to and from our customers in all 48 continental us states and 9 canadian provinces and we ship globally to customers in other countries our 

delivery fleet utilizes a third party software provider to optimize delivery routes and to track the progress of delivery vehicles throughout their runs 

competition 

industry participants have a variety of supply choices vendors can deliver products to market via warehouse distributors and mail order catalog businesses or directly to retailers andor consumers we view all distributors of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories as our competitors we believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and equipment distributors primarily through our broad product selection which encompasses both popular and hardtofind products our national distribution network and our efficient inventory management systems as well as through our service we compete on the basis of product breadth and depth rapid and dependable delivery marketing initiatives support services and price

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related repairs our aftermarket glass operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the second and third quarters when the demand for automotive replacement glass increases after the winter weather our specialty vehicle operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the second quarter when vehicle owners tend to install this equipment and lower revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter when the number of rv trips tends to decline as a result of the winter weather however the covid19 pandemic created an increased demand in the rv market in 2020 and the effect on demand extended into the fourth quarter additionally seasonality may affect our product mix for example collision parts tend to have higher demand in the winter as there are generally higher accident rates 

environmental social and governance matters   

environmental 

we contribute to a healthy environment for example our north american recycling operations harvest vehicle components for reuse in the repair of vehicles once the parts are harvested the remaining valuable materials are removed and repurposed for use in the manufacturing of new basic materials such as steel aluminum plastic and rubber additionally we extract fluids that we recycle or utilize in our own operations such as fuel to run our own truck fleet 

our recycling efforts are a key pillar of our mission statement of being a responsible steward of the environment and a true partner with the communities in which we operate this stewardship has been embedded in our culture since the company’s founding in 1998 our recycling efforts preserve natural resources reduce the demand for scarce landfill space and help decrease air and water pollution

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the occurrence of any of the following risks or of unknown risks and uncertainties may adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition for a summary of risk factors refer to special note on forwardlooking statements in part i of this annual report on form 10k 

risks relating to our business 

our operating results and financial condition have been and will likely continue to be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic and could be adversely affected by other public health emergencies 

the covid19 pandemic is adversely affecting and is expected to continue to adversely affect our business and operations government authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate have recommended or mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of covid19 including prohibitions on congregating in various locations travel restrictions shelterinplace orders and similar measures these measures have resulted in a significant reduction in miles driven as a result we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable reductions in demand for our products although we have been permitted to continue to operate in most of the jurisdictions in which we operate including in jurisdictions that have mandated the closure of certain businesses there is no assurance that we will be permitted to continue operations under future government orders or other restrictions 

in order to reduce costs in an attempt to offset reductions in revenue we have implemented various cost reductions to align with the lower level of economic activity including employee layoffs and furloughs these actions may result in a significant increase in employmentrelated claims and the associated risks and expenses related thereto due to the selfinsured nature of our health insurance program we may be subject to substantial increases in healthcare costs in the event that a significant number of our employees become ill and require medical treatment due to covid19 infections also we may suffer workforce shortages andor lose the services of key management personnel due to employees contracting the covid19 virus or due to employees being subject to quarantine because of possible exposure to a person who tested positive for the virus although we have been taking precautions as recommended by governmental agencies to protect the health and safety of our employees who are continuing to work we may be subject to claims that we did not take adequate or appropriate measures in this regard we have also implemented remote work arrangements for many of our employees which may expose us to an increased risk of cyberattack or other cybersecurity threats 

in the event that the pandemic subsides and business increases there can be no assurance that we will be able to recall or rehire the appropriate number of employees with the proper skill sets to handle the increase in business 

we are continuing to evaluate the applicability of certain financial assistance and relief programs from foreign governments while we have pursued and will continue to pursue this government assistance where possible and advisable there is no guarantee as to what amount if any we would qualify for and receive in the future 

the covid19 pandemic is adversely affecting our business partners including our suppliers and customers depending on the extent of the adverse effects we may not be able to source sufficient inventory to provide products to our customers even at reduceddemand levels and the ability of our customers to continue operating or to pay us for our products may be disrupted 

depending on the length and severity of the adverse effects on our business of the covid19 pandemic we may determine that our goodwill or other longlived assets have become impaired or that the carrying value of our receivables and inventory may no longer be recoverable if either or both occur we may incur significant charges to our pretax income 

depending on the length and severity of the adverse effects on our business of the covid19 pandemic we may not satisfy one or more of the financial or other covenants in our credit facility failure to satisfy any such covenant could inhibit our ability to borrow money under our credit facility should we need to do so or could result in a default under our credit facility the covid19 pandemic has caused severe macroeconomic disruptions including substantial price volatility in the equities markets including the price of our common stock and concerns about the liquidity of the credit markets these macroeconomic disruptions may also affect our ability to borrow money or otherwise raise cash 

there is uncertainty with respect to the duration and breadth of the covid19 pandemic moreover even after the mitigation measures are relaxed by government authorities the timing and extent of the recovery of the economies in the countries where we operate is difficult to estimate thus the ultimate impact on our business financial results and financial condition cannot reasonably be estimated at this time in addition even if the adverse effects of the covid19 pandemic subside there is the possibility of a recurrence of covid19 or the emergence of a different pandemic or health emergency with similar economic disruptions certain jurisdictions are reinstating mitigation measures at least through february 2021 

our operating results and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the economic political and social conditions in the us europe and elsewhere as well as the economic health of vehicle owners and numbers and types of vehicles sold 

changes in economic political and social conditions in the us europe and other countries in which we are located or do business could have a material effect on our company negative effects to our supply chain costs of doing business sales and distribution activity may occur due to factors such as war or threats of war natural disasters nuclear facility accidents public health emergencies utility interruptions terrorism and social unrest 

our business is also affected by a number of other factors for example the number and types of new vehicles produced and sold by manufacturers affects our business a decrease in the number of vehicles on the road may result in a decrease in repairs 

our sales are also impacted by changes to the economic health of vehicle owners the economic health of vehicle owners is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit taxation fuel prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside of our control if any of these conditions worsen our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities and hedge transactions these unfavorable events affecting our business partners could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we have a substantial business presence in europe including a significant presence in the uk and the republic of ireland “roi” in june 2016 voters in the uk decided by referendum to withdraw from the european union also known as brexit the uk’s withdrawal from the european union became effective on january 31 2020 the uk and the european union negotiated a trade and cooperation agreement “tca” to govern the new relationship which became effective on january 1 2021 following the adoption of the tca duties have increased on some of the products we import into the uk and we have observed shipment delays particularly with respect to the products we supply to our business in the roi while the extent and impact of these issues is not clear at this point they could have adverse impacts on our business notwithstanding the tca there continues to be uncertainty regarding the effects of brexit on our uk and european businesses including with respect to tariffs or trade sanctions on goods moving between the jurisdictions increased administrative burdens fluctuations in exchange rates disruptions in access to markets by uk and roi companies and disagreements about the interpretation of the tca 

the widespread use of social media platforms has increased the speed and scope that information or misinformation about us can be disseminated and could hamper our ability to correct misrepresentations or to otherwise respond effectively to negative publicity negative posts about us our employees our business practices or our products or services whether or not valid could seriously damage our brands and reputation 

we face competition from local national international and internetbased vehicle products providers and this competition could negatively affect our business 

the vehicle replacement products industry and vehicle accessory parts industry are highly competitive and are served by numerous suppliers of oem recycled aftermarket refurbished and remanufactured products within each of these categories of suppliers there are local owneroperated companies larger regional suppliers national and international providers and internetbased suppliers and distributors providers of vehicle replacement and accessory products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of vehicle products which may further increase competition some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise greater financial technical manufacturing distribution and other resources longer operating histories lower cost structures and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries or with consumers than we do business transacted on online marketplaces has been increasing which presents additional competitive pressures on us in addition facilitators of these online marketplaces control access to this channel and may prohibit us from participating for various reasons 

in the us and europe local companies have formed cooperative efforts in an attempt to more efficiently compete against us in all aspects of our business as a result of these factors our competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply provide their products at lower costs or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve 

we believe that a majority of collision parts by dollar amount are supplied by oems with the balance being supplied by distributors of alternative aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured collision parts like us the oems are 

therefore able to exert pricing pressure in the marketplace we compete with the oems primarily on price and to a lesser extent on service and quality 

from time to time the oems have engaged in efforts seeking to increase oem market share and to restrict consumers’ choice to use recycled or aftermarket parts to repair consumers’ vehicles examples of these efforts include blocking the use of vehicle telematics by the independent repair industry demanding that suppliers provide certain parts exclusively to the oems embedding software in certain vehicle parts that prevents them from being recycled and used to repair other vehicles repair shop certification programs that in some cases require the repair shops to use only oem parts refusing to sell certain oem parts unless the buyer is an oemcertified shop obtaining patents and trademarks on various subcomponents of vehicles to prohibit the use of an aftermarket part alternative and price matching and rebate programs on certain aftermarket products see the risk factor entitled “ intellectual property claims relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business ” for further information about the oem patents and trademarks 

with respect to telematics vehicles are increasingly being equipped with systems that transmit data to the oems wirelessly regarding among other items accident incidents maintenance requirements location of the vehicle identification of the closest dealership and other statistics about the vehicle and its driving history to the extent that this data is not shared with alternative suppliers the oems will have an advantage with respect to such matters as contacting the vehicle driver recommending repairs and maintenance and directing the vehicle owner to an affiliated dealership 

the frequency and intensity of these oem efforts has been increasing over time the growth and effectiveness of these efforts or the introduction of new ones could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we rely upon our customers and insurance companies to promote the usage of alternative parts 

our success depends in part on the acceptance and promotion of alternative parts usage by automotive insurance companies and vehicle repair facilities there can be no assurance that current levels of alternative parts usage will be maintained or will increase in the future 

we rely on business relationships with insurance companies these insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide the business relationships include in some cases participation in aftermarket quality and service assurance programs that may result in a higher usage of our aftermarket products than would be the case without the programs our arrangements with these companies may be terminated by them at any time including in connection with their own business concerns relating to the offering availability standards or operations of the aftermarket quality and service assurance programs we rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in an illinois lawsuit involving state farm mutual automobile insurance company avery v state farm a jury decided in october 1999 that state farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using nonoem replacement products to repair damaged vehicles when use of such products did not restore the vehicle to its preloss condition the jury found that state farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of nonoem replacement products and the alleged inferiority of those products damages in excess of 1 billion were assessed against state farm in august 2005 the illinois supreme court reversed the awards made by the lower courts and found among other things that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any breach of contract by state farm the plaintiffs filed a subsequent claim alleging that state farm improperly influenced one of the justices on the illinois supreme court prior to trial on the subsequent claim the parties settled the case as part of the settlement state farm paid the plaintiffs 250 million as a result of this case some insurance companies reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket products our financial results could be adversely affected if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled products from us due to a fear of similar claims 

in addition to the extent that the collision repair industry continues to consolidate the buying power of collision repair shop customers may further increase putting additional pressure on our financial returns 

intellectual property claims relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business 

oems and others have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims oems have brought such claims in federal court and with the us international trade commission in some cases we have entered into patent license agreements with oems that allow us to sell aftermarket parts that replicate the patented parts in exchange for a royalty and otherwise in accordance with the terms of the agreements 

to the extent oems and other manufacturers obtain design patents or trademarks and are successful in asserting claims of infringement of these patents or trademarks against us we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business in the event that our license agreements or other similar license arrangements with oems or others are terminated or we are unable to agree upon renewal terms we may be 

subject to costs and uncertainties of litigation as well as restrictions on our ability to sell aftermarket parts that replicate parts covered by those design patents or trademarks we have filed and may file in the future challenges to oem patents including patents owned by oems with which we have patent license agreements we also may file challenges to oem trademarks to the extent oems are successful in defending their patents or trademarks we could be restricted or prohibited from selling the corresponding aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business also we will likely incur expenses investigating pursuing and defending intellectual property claims 

us customs and border protection has taken the position that certain of our aftermarket parts infringe certain oem trademarks and seized our aftermarket parts as we attempted to import them into the us we incur costs and expenses attempting to convince customs and border protection to release the seized goods and in litigation where we seek a determination of noninfringement in the event we are unsuccessful in obtaining their release such goods may be subject to forfeiture and other penalties 

aftermarket products certifying organizations may revoke the certification of parts that are the subject of the intellectual property disputes lack of certification may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of aftermarket products only if they have been certified by an independent certifying organization 

if the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines or the number of cars being repaired declines or the mix of the types of vehicles in the overall vehicle population changes our business could suffer 

our business depends on vehicle accidents mechanical failures and routine maintenance for both the demand for repairs using our products and the supply of recycled remanufactured and refurbished parts to the extent that a relatively higher percentage of damaged vehicles are declared total losses there will be less demand for our products to repair such vehicles in addition our business is impacted by factors that influence the number andor severity of accidents and mechanical failures including but not limited to the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven the ages of drivers the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions the congestion of traffic drivers distracted by electronic equipment the use of alcohol or drugs by drivers the usage rate and effectiveness of accident avoidance systems in new vehicles the reliability of new oem parts and the condition of roadways for example an increase in the acceptance of ridesharing could reduce the number of vehicles on the road additionally an increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the need for mechanical repairs and maintenance to decline as motorists seek alternative transportation options mild weather conditions particularly during winter months tend to result in a decrease in vehicle accidents moreover legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones or other electronic devices while driving could lead to a decline in accidents 

systems designed to minimize accident frequency and severity are becoming more prevalent and more technologically sophisticated to the extent oems install or are mandated by law to install accident avoidance systems in their vehicles the number and severity of accidents could decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the average number of new vehicles sold annually has fluctuated from yeartoyear periods of decreased sales could result in a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road and consequently fewer vehicles involved in accidents or in need of mechanical repair or maintenance substantial further declines in automotive sales in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition in addition if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of older vehicles on the road insurance companies may find it uneconomical to repair such vehicles or there could be less costly repairs if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of newer vehicles on the road the demand generally for mechanical repairs and maintenance would likely decline due to the newer longerlasting parts in the vehicle population and mechanical failures being covered by oem warranties for the first years of a vehicles life moreover alternative collision and mechanical parts are less likely to be used on newer vehicles our specialty segment depends on sales of pickup trucks sport utility vehicles crossover utility vehicles high performance vehicles and recreational vehicles any reduction in the number of such vehicles in operation will adversely affect demand for our specialty products 

electric vehicles do not have traditional engines transmissions and certain related parts engines and transmissions represent some of our largest revenue generating skus in north america and parts for engines and transmissions represent a significant amount of the revenue of our european operations thus an increase in electric vehicles as a percentage of vehicles sold could have a negative impact on our sales of engines transmissions and other related parts 

fluctuations in the prices of metals and other commodities could adversely affect our financial results 

our recycling operations generate scrap metal and precious metals such as platinum palladium and rhodium as well as other metals that we sell after we dismantle a salvage vehicle for wholesale parts and after vehicles have been processed in our self service retail business the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors and other remaining metals are sold to processors and brokers of metals in addition we receive crush only vehicles or vehicles to be further processed from other 

companies including oems which we dismantle and which generate scrap metal and other metals in accordance with the guidelines of our agreements with the providing company the prices of scrap and other metals have historically fluctuated sometimes significantly due to market factors in addition buyers may stop purchasing metals entirely due to excess supply to the extent that the prices of metals decrease materially or buyers stop purchasing metals our revenue from such sales will suffer and a writedown of our inventory value could be required for example in 2018 china imposed stringent purity restrictions on the importation of various types of solid waste allegedly in an effort to reduce environmental pollution 

the cost of our wholesale recycled and our self service retail inventory purchases will change as a result of fluctuating scrap metal and other metals prices in a period of falling metal prices there can be no assurance that our inventory purchasing cost will decrease the same amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal and other metals prices decline and there may be a delay between the scrap metal and other metals price reductions and any inventory cost reductions the prices of steel aluminum and plastics are components of the cost to manufacture products for our aftermarket business if the prices of commodities rise and result in higher costs to us for products we sell we may not be able to pass these higher costs on to our customers 

an adverse change in our relationships with our suppliers disruption to our supply of inventory or the misconduct performance failures or negligence of our third party vendors or service providers could increase our expenses impede our ability to serve our customers or expose us to liability 

our north american business is dependent on a relatively small number of suppliers of aftermarket products a large portion of which are sourced from taiwan our european business also acquires product from asian sources we incur substantial freight costs to import parts from our suppliers many of which are located in asia if the cost of freight rose we might not be able to pass the cost increases on to our customers furthermore although alternative suppliers exist for substantially all aftermarket products distributed by us the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on us until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced manufacturing and providing the relevant products in addition we are subject to disruptions from work stoppages and other labor disputes at port facilities through which we import our inventory we also face the risk that our suppliers could attempt to circumvent us and sell their product directly to our customers consolidation of our suppliers could enhance their ability to distribute products through additional sales channels and thus decrease their reliance on wholesale distributors like us 

moreover our operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad including among other things natural disasters transportation costs and delays political instability currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs import and export controls and other nontariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas as well as the uncertainty regarding future relations between china japan and taiwan for example us customs and border protection have used claims of intellectual property infringement to seize certain of our aftermarket parts as we attempted to import them into the us 

because a substantial volume of our sales involves products manufactured from sheet metal we can be adversely impacted if sheet metal becomes unavailable or is only available at higher prices which we may not be able to pass on to our customers additionally as oems convert to raw materials other than steel it may be more difficult or expensive to source aftermarket parts made with such materials and it may be more difficult for repair shops to work with such materials in the repair process 

most of our salvage and a portion of our self service inventory is obtained from vehicles offered at salvage auctions operated by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the us we do not typically have contracts with the auction companies according to industry analysts a small number of companies control a large percentage of the salvage auction market in the us if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions began competing with us or significantly raised its fees our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers moreover we face competition in the purchase of vehicles from direct competitors rebuilders exporters and other bidders to the extent that the number of bidders increases it may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold for wholesale recycled products some states regulate bidders to help ensure that salvage vehicles are purchased for legal purposes by qualified buyers auction companies have been actively seeking to reduce circumvent or eliminate these regulations which would further increase the number of bidders 

in addition there is a limited supply of salvage vehicles in the us and thus the costs to us of these vehicles could increase over time in some states when a vehicle is deemed a total loss a salvage title is issued whether states issue salvage titles is important to the supply of inventory for the vehicle recycling industry because an increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles currently these titling issues are a matter of state law in 1992 the us congress commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle titling registration and salvage since then legislation has been introduced seeking to establish national uniform requirements in this area including a uniform definition of a salvage vehicle the vehicle recycling industry will generally favor a uniform definition since it will avoid inconsistencies across state lines and will generally favor a definition that expands the number of 

damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage however certain interest groups including repair shops and some insurance associations may oppose this type of legislation national legislation has not yet been enacted in this area and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in the future 

we also acquire inventory directly from insurance companies oems and others to the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue these arrangements our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers 

in europe we acquire products from a wide variety of suppliers as vehicle technology changes some parts will become more complex and the design or technology of those parts may be covered by patents or other rights that make it difficult for aftermarket suppliers to produce for sale to companies such as ours the complexity of the parts may include software or other technical aspects that make it difficult to identify what is wrong with the vehicle more complex parts may be difficult to repair and may require expensive or difficult to obtain software updates limiting our ability to compete with the oems 

we rely on third parties to provide products and services that are integral to our operations if we fail to adequately assess monitor and regulate the performance of our third party vendors and service providers we could be subject to additional risk caused by the misconduct performance failures or negligence of these third parties for example these could include violations of or noncompliance with laws andor regulations governing our business including but not limited to bribery cybersecurity or privacy laws which could lead to sanctions andor fines from governmental agencies our arrangements with third party vendors and service providers may cause us financial and reputational harm if those third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us including their obligations to maintain and protect the security and confidentiality of our information and data or the information and data relating to our customers further noncompliance with contract terms by our third party vendors or service providers could expose us to liability to other third parties or our employees 

if we determine that our goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired we may incur significant charges to our pretax income 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations in the future our goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of acquisitions goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses deterioration of expected future cash flows or performance increases in our cost of capital adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including modifications that restrict the activities of the acquired business as of december 31 2020 our total goodwill subject to future impairment testing was 46 billion for further discussion of our annual impairment test see goodwill impairment in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of item 7 in this annual report on form 10k 

except for indefinitelived intangibles we amortize other intangible assets over the assigned useful lives each of which is based upon the expected period to be benefited we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we review finitelived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in the event conditions change that affect our ability to realize the underlying cash flows associated with our intangible assets we may record an impairment charge as of december 31 2020  the value of our other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization was 814 million 

we could be subject to product liability claims and involved in product recalls 

if customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage we could be subject to product liability claims by such customers the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we may become involved in the recall of a product that is determined to be defective more generally a recall involving alternative parts even if we did not sell the recalled products could adversely affect the perceived quality of alternative parts leading to decreased usage of alternative parts the expenses of a recall and the damage to our reputation or the reputation of alternative parts generally could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have agreed to defend and indemnify in certain circumstances insurance companies and customers against claims and damages relating to product liability and product recalls the existence of claims or damages for which we must defend and indemnify these parties could also negatively impact our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may not be able to successfully acquire new businesses or integrate acquisitions and we may not be able to successfully divest certain businesses 

we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms if we do not obtain required antitrust or other regulatory approvals or for other reasons moreover we may not be able to identify acquisition candidates at reasonable prices andor be able to successfully integrate acquisitions 

if we buy a company or a division of a company we may experience difficulty integrating that companys or divisions personnel and operations which could negatively affect our operating results in addition 

• the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 

• customers of the acquired company may decide not to purchase products from us 

• suppliers of the acquired company may decide not to sell products to us 

• we may experience business disruptions as a result of information technology systems conversions 

• we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning treasury management and financial reporting 

• we may be held liable for environmental tax or other risks and liabilities as a result of our acquisitions some of which we may not have discovered during our due diligence 

• we may intentionally assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire which could result in material adverse effects on our business 

• our existing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention 

• we may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated either in the amount or in the time frame that we expect and 

• we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition the issuance of which could involve the imposition of restrictive covenants or be dilutive to our existing stockholders 

for example we have undertaken the 1 lkq europe program to create structural centralization and standardization of key functions to facilitate the operation of the europe segment as a single business this program will present a number of execution challenges the covid19 pandemic has also impacted certain 1 lkq europe initiatives resulting in minor delays of certain initiatives 

in addition to acquisitions we have divested and will continue to divest certain businesses that do not meet our performance standards as a result of a divestment we may not recover the carrying value of our investment in the divested business in addition such divestment transactions require significant management time and attention 

risks relating to our financial structure 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to react to changes in our business 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 967 million aggregate principal amount of secured debt outstanding and approximately 24 billion of availability under our credit agreement 25 billion of availability reduced by 71 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit in addition we had approximately 18 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured debt outstanding comprised of €500 million 611 million aggregate principal amount of 3875 senior notes due april 1 2024 the euro notes 2024 and €10 billion 12 billion aggregate principal amount consisting of €750 million of 3625 senior notes due 2026 the euro notes 2026 and €250 million of 4125 senior notes due 2028 the euro notes 2028 together with the 2026 notes the euro notes 202628 and together with the euro notes 2024 and euro notes 2026 the senior notes borrowings under the credit agreement mature in january 2024 

our significant amount of debt and our debt service obligations could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations limit our ability to operate our business and impair our competitive position 

for example our debt and our debt service obligations could 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and general industry conditions including interest rate fluctuations because a portion of our borrowings are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt which would reduce the availability of our cash flow from operations to fund working capital capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry 

• place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt 

• limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements and 

• increase our cost of borrowing 

in addition if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the ability to service such debt would increase 

our senior notes do not impose any limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or protect against certain other types of transactions 

although we are subject to our credit agreement for so long as it remains in effect the indentures governing the senior notes do not restrict the future incurrence of unsecured indebtedness guarantees or other obligations the indentures contain certain limitations on our ability to incur liens on assets and engage in sale and leaseback transactions however these limitations are subject to important exceptions in addition the indentures do not contain many other restrictions including certain restrictions contained in our credit agreement including without limitation making investments prepaying subordinated indebtedness or engaging in transactions with our affiliates 

our credit agreement will permit subject to specified conditions and limitations the incurrence of a significant amount of additional indebtedness under the existing agreement as of december 31 2020 we would have been able to incur an additional 24 billion of indebtedness under our credit agreement 25 billion of availability reduced by 71 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the need to service such debt would increase 

our credit agreement imposes operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

our credit agreement imposes operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions may limit our ability among other things to 

• incur assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness including guarantees thereof outside of our credit agreement 

• pay dividends or make certain other distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness 

• incur liens on assets 

• make certain investments or other restricted payments 

• engage in transactions with affiliates 

• sell certain assets or merge or consolidate with or into other companies 

• guarantee indebtedness and 

• alter the business we conduct 

as a result of these covenants and restrictions we may be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit agreement a default if not waived could result in acceleration of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing credit facilities or it may be on terms that are not acceptable to us 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and 

capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we hope to realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due any future refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations additionally our credit agreement and the indentures that govern our senior notes limit the use of the proceeds from certain dispositions of our assets as a result our credit agreement and our senior notes may prevent us from using the proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all of our debt service obligations 

our future capital needs may require that we seek to refinance our debt or obtain additional debt or equity financing events that could have a negative effect on our business 

we may need to raise additional funds in the future to among other things refinance existing debt fund our existing operations improve or expand our operations respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions from time to time we may raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic alliances or other arrangements funds may not be available or available on terms acceptable to us as a result of different factors including but not limited to turmoil in the credit markets that results in the tightening of credit conditions and current or future regulations applicable to the financial institutions from which we seek financing if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of our common stock if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and further limitations on our operations if we refinance or restructure our debt we may incur charges to write off the unamortized portion of deferred debt issuance costs from a previous financing or we may incur charges related to hedge ineffectiveness from our interest rate swap obligations there are restrictions in the indenture that governs the euro notes 2024 euro notes 2026 and euro notes 2028 on our ability to refinance such notes prior to january 1 2024 april 1 2021 and april 1 2023 respectively we could refinance the notes through open market purchases subject to a limitation in our credit agreement on the amount of such purchases if we fail to raise capital when needed our business may be negatively affected 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly and could affect the value of our senior notes 

certain borrowings under our credit agreement and the borrowing under our accounts receivable securitization facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness would correspondingly decrease moreover changes in market interest rates could affect the trading value of the senior notes certain of our variable rate debt including our revolving credit facility currently uses the london interbank offered rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate libor is the subject of proposals for reform these reforms and other pressures may cause libor to disappear entirely potentially as soon as the end of 2021 or to perform differently than in the past the consequences of these developments with respect to libor cannot be entirely predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt 

repayment of our indebtedness including our senior notes is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries 

we are a holding company and repayment of our senior notes will be dependent upon cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are borrowers or guarantors of the indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness including the senior notes each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries and under certain circumstances distributions from our subsidiaries may be subject to taxes that reduce the amount of such distributions available to us while the indentures governing the senior notes limit the ability of our subsidiaries to restrict the payment of dividends or to restrict other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness including the senior notes 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our senior notes 

credit ratings have an important effect on our cost of capital credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include among other items our results of operations business decisions that we make their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading we 

believe our current credit ratings enhance our ability to borrow funds at favorable rates a downgrade in our current credit rating from a rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facilities a downgrade could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our senior notes preventing a holder from selling the senior notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affecting our ability to issue new notes in the future or incur other indebtedness upon favorable terms 

the right to receive payments on the senior notes is effectively junior to those lenders who have a security interest in our assets 

our obligations under our senior notes and our guarantors’ obligations under their guarantees of the senior notes are unsecured but our and each coborrower’s obligations under our credit agreement and each guarantor’s obligations under their respective guarantees of the credit agreement are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our domestic tangible and intangible assets including the stock of most of our whollyowned united states subsidiaries and the stock of certain of our nonunited states subsidiaries if we are declared bankrupt or insolvent or if we default under our credit agreement the lenders could declare all of the funds borrowed thereunder together with accrued interest immediately due and payable if we were unable to repay such indebtedness the lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets to the exclusion of holders of our senior notes even if an event of default exists under the applicable indenture governing the senior notes furthermore if the lenders foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any subsidiary guarantor under our senior notes then that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the senior notes automatically and immediately upon such sale in any such event because the senior notes are not secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in subsidiary guarantors it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from which claims by holders of the senior notes could be satisfied or if any assets remained they might be insufficient to satisfy claims fully as of december 31 2020  we had approximately 967 million aggregate principal amount of secured debt outstanding and approximately 24 billion of availability under our credit agreement 25 billion of availability reduced by 71 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit 

united states federal and state statutes allow courts under specific circumstances to void the senior notes and the guarantees subordinate claims in respect of the senior notes and the guarantees and require holders of the senior notes to return payments received from us or the guarantors 

our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that are obligors under the credit agreement guarantee the obligations under our senior notes in addition certain subsidiaries of the issuer of the euro notes 2024 guarantee the obligations under the euro notes 2024 the issuance of our senior notes and the issuance of the guarantees by the guarantors may be subject to review under state and federal laws if a bankruptcy liquidation or reorganization case or a lawsuit including in circumstances in which bankruptcy is not involved were commenced at some future date by or on behalf of our unpaid creditors or the unpaid creditors of a guarantor under the federal bankruptcy laws of the united states and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws a court may avoid or otherwise decline to enforce the senior notes or a guarantor’s guarantee or may subordinate the senior notes or such guarantee to our or the applicable guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness while the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction a court might do so if it found that when indebtedness under the senior notes was issued or when the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee or in some jurisdictions when payments became due under the senior notes or such guarantee the issuer or the applicable guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and 

• was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence 

• was engaged in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital or 

• intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature 

a court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the senior notes or such guarantee if we or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the senior notes thus if the guarantees were legally challenged any guarantee could be subject to the claim that since the guarantee was incurred for our benefit and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration if a court were to void the issuance of the senior notes or any guarantee a holder of the senior notes would no longer have any claim against us or the applicable guarantor in the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred a holder of the senior notes may not receive any repayment on the senior notes further the avoidance of the senior notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt which could result in acceleration of that debt the measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred generally however an issuer or a guarantor as applicable would be considered insolvent if 

• the sum of its debts including contingent liabilities was greater than the fair value of its assets 

• the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts including contingent liabilities as they become absolute and mature or 

• it could not pay its debts as they become due 

a court might also void the senior notes or a guarantee without regard to the above factors if the court found that the senior notes were incurred or issued or the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee with actual intent to hinder delay or defraud its creditors we cannot give any assurance as to what standard a court would apply in determining whether we or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard or regardless of the standard that a court uses that it would not determine that we or a guarantor were indeed insolvent on that date that any payments to the holders of the senior notes including under the guarantees did not constitute preferences fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds or that the issuance of the senior notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to our or any guarantor’s other debt in addition any payment by us or a guarantor pursuant to the senior notes or its guarantee could be avoided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors and accordingly the court might direct holders of the senior notes to repay any amounts already received from us or such guarantor among other things under us bankruptcy law any payment by us pursuant to the senior notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time we or such guarantor were found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a oneyear period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside party and such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such party would have received in a distribution under the bankruptcy code in a hypothetical chapter 7 case although each guarantee contains a “savings clause” intended to limit the subsidiary guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its subsidiary guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer this provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect any subsidiary guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law in that regard in official committee of unsecured creditors of tousa inc v citicorp north america inc  the united states bankruptcy court in the southern district of florida held that a savings clause similar to the savings clause included in our indentures was unenforceable as a result the subsidiary guarantees were found to be fraudulent conveyances the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit subsequently affirmed the liability findings of the bankruptcy court without ruling directly on the enforceability of savings clauses generally if the decision of the bankruptcy court in tousa were followed by other courts the risk that the guarantees would be deemed fraudulent conveyances would be significantly increased 

to the extent a court avoids the senior notes or any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or holds the senior notes or any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason the holders of the senior notes would cease to have any direct claim against us or the applicable guarantor if a court were to take this action our or the applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy our or the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities if any and might not be applied to the payment of the senior notes sufficient funds to repay the senior notes may not be available from other sources including the remaining guarantors if any in addition the euro notes 2024 and the related guarantees may be subject to avoidance under the laws of foreign jurisdictions including italy and czech republic to the extent that we the issuer of the euro notes 2024 or any of the guarantors as applicable were to be the subject of an insolvency or related proceeding in such jurisdictions 

not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our credit agreement or our senior notes and the assets of our nonguarantor subsidiaries may not be available to make payments on such obligations 

not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the credit agreement euro notes 2024 euro notes 2026 and euro notes 2028 in the event that any nonguarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent liquidates reorganizes dissolves or otherwise winds up holders of its indebtedness and its trade creditors generally will be entitled to payment on their claims from the assets of that subsidiary before any of those assets are made available to the lenders under the credit agreement or the holders of the senior notes consequently claims in respect of the credit agreement and the senior notes are structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors of such instruments including trade payables and any claims of third party holders of preferred equity interests if any in our nonguarantor subsidiaries as of the most recent practicable date our subsidiaries that are not borrowers under or do not guarantee the credit agreement represented approximately 50 and 24 of our total revenue and operating income respectively in addition these nonguarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 55 and 60 of our total assets and total liabilities respectively excluding in each case intercompany amounts as of the most recent practicable date our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the credit agreement had approximately 19 billion of outstanding indebtedness the group of subsidiaries that does not guarantee the euro notes 2024 is substantially similar to the group that does not guarantee the euro notes 2026 and euro notes 2028 except that in addition to the issuer of the euro notes 2024 there are four subsidiaries in the group that do not guarantee the euro notes 2026 and euro notes 2028 that guarantee the euro notes 2024 

we may not be able to repurchase the senior notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer 

upon a change of control as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes the holders of the senior notes will have the right to require us to offer to purchase all of the senior notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest such a change of control would also be an event of default under our credit agreement in order to obtain sufficient funds to pay amounts due under the credit agreement and the purchase price of the 

outstanding senior notes we expect that we would have to refinance our indebtedness we cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance our indebtedness on reasonable terms if at all our failure to offer to purchase all outstanding senior notes or to purchase all validly tendered senior notes would be an event of default under the indenture such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other debt our other debt also may contain restrictions or repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture 

the definition of change of control in the indentures governing the senior notes includes a phrase relating to the sale of “all or substantially all” of our assets there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law accordingly the ability of a holder of senior notes to require us to repurchase its senior notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain 

in addition in certain circumstances as specified in the indentures governing the senior notes if we sell certain assets we will be required to either prepay secured debt of the issuer or guarantors of the senior notes prepay debt of nonguarantor whollyowned subsidiaries reinvest the sale proceeds in other assets or commence an asset sale offer as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes pursuant to which we will be obligated to purchase certain senior notes at a price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest with the proceeds we receive from such asset sales our other debt may contain restrictions that would limit or prohibit us from completing any such asset sale offer in particular our credit agreement contains provisions that require us upon the sale of certain assets to either apply all of the proceeds from such asset sale to the prepayment of the term loan amounts due under the credit agreement or to reinvest such proceeds in real estate equipment or tangible assets if we chose to prepay the term loan obligations instead of reinvesting in assets the mandatory prepayment obligations under the credit agreement will be effectively senior to our obligations to make an asset sale offer with respect to the senior notes under the terms of the indentures governing the senior notes 

key terms of the senior notes will be suspended if the notes achieve investment grade ratings and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing 

many of the covenants in the indentures governing the senior notes will be suspended if the senior notes are rated investment grade by standard  poor’s and moody’s provided at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing including those covenants that restrict among other things our ability to pay dividends incur liens and to enter into certain other transactions there can be no assurance that the senior notes will ever be rated investment grade however suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force although provisions under our other debt like the credit agreement may continue to restrict us from engaging in these transactions and the effects of any such transactions will be permitted to remain in place even if the senior notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade 

the liquidity and market value of the senior notes may change due to a variety of factors 

the liquidity of any trading market in the senior notes and the market price quoted for the senior notes may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for these types of securities changes in interest rates changes in our ratings and changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industries generally 

legal and regulatory risks 

existing or new laws and regulations or changes to enforcement or interpretation of existing laws or regulations may prohibit restrict or burden the sale of aftermarket recycled refurbished or remanufactured products 

many states have introduced or passed laws that limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair these laws include requirements relating to consumer disclosure vehicle owner’s consent regarding the use of aftermarket products in the repair process and the requirement to have aftermarket products certified by an independent testing organization additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future if additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business 

certain organizations test the quality and safety of vehicle replacement products if these organizations decide not to test a particular vehicle product or in the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product such events could adversely affect our business 

some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags in addition laws relating to the regulation of parts affecting vehicle emissions such as california’s proposition 65 may impact the ability of our specialty segment to sell certain accessory products these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled products the passage of legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on our business additionally congress could enact federal legislation restricting the use of aftermarket or recycled automotive products used in the course of vehicle repairs 

the federal trade commission has issued guides that regulate the use of certain terms such as “rebuilt” or “remanufactured” in connection with the sale of automotive parts restrictions on the products we are able to sell and on the marketing of such products could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters 

we are subject to various environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators or lose our operating permits we could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials we have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements we cannot assure you however that we will at all times be in complete compliance with such requirements 

we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future 

under certain environmental laws we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at or migration to or from our or our predecessors past or present facilities and at independent waste disposal sites these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or was not responsible for the release of such hazardous substances many of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use that may have involved hazardous materials as a result some of our properties may be contaminated some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination these environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of treats or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties or successors to such owners or operators for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 

contamination resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release storage transportation or disposal of gasoline motor oil antifreeze transmission fluid chlorofluorocarbons cfcs from air conditioners other hazardous materials or metals such as aluminum cadmium chromium lead and mercury contamination from the refurbishment of chrome plated bumpers can occur from the release of the plating material contamination can migrate onsite or offsite which can increase the risk and the amount of any potential liability 

when we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process we analyze the risks and when appropriate perform further environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination furthermore where appropriate we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters in the event we discover new information or if laws change we may incur significant liabilities which may exceed our reserves 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our amended and restated bylaws provide that the courts in the state of delaware are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees 

our amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if the court of chancery does not have jurisdiction another court of the state of delaware or if no court of the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware shall be the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings 

• any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; 

• any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; 

• any action asserting a claim against us arising under the delaware general corporation law our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; 

• any action asserting a claim governed by the internalaffairs doctrine and 

• any action to interpret apply enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws 

the choice of forum provision in our bylaws does not apply to claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act or the securities act or any claim with respect to which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction 

although we believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers due to among other possible factors increased costs of such lawsuits and limitations on the ability to bring claims in a judicial forum that the plaintiffs may consider more favorable alternatively if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

our effective tax rate could materially increase as a consequence of various factors including interpretations and administrative guidance in regard to the tax act defined below us andor international tax legislation mix of earnings by jurisdiction and us and foreign jurisdictional audits 

we are a us based multinational company subject to income taxes in the us and a number of foreign jurisdictions therefore we are subject to changes in tax laws in each of these jurisdictions including as a result of changes proposed by the new us administration and such changes could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate and cash flows 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act among other things the tax act reduced the us statutory corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 additionally beginning in 2018 the tax act imposed a regime of taxation on foreign subsidiary earnings global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” and on certain related party payments base erosion antiabuse tax “beat” other important changes potentially material to our operations included the full expensing of certain assets placed into service after september 27 2017 the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction and additional limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation finally as part of the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system the tax act imposed a onetime transition tax on the deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 

many nonus jurisdictions are implementing tax legislation based upon recommendations made by the organization for economic cooperation and development in connection with its base erosion and profit shifting study as well as certain antitaxavoidance initiatives advanced by the european commission the outcome of these legislative developments could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate and cash flows 

the tax rates applicable in the jurisdictions within which we operate vary widely therefore our effective tax rate may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of our earnings by jurisdiction 

we are also subject to ongoing audits of our income tax returns in various jurisdictions both in the us and internationally while we believe that our tax positions will be sustained the outcomes of such audits could result in the assessment of additional taxes which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results 

if significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on products or materials we import or any related countermeasures are taken by countries to which we export products our revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed 

the us has imposed tariffs on certain materials imported into the us from china and announced additional tariffs on other goods from china and other countries moreover countermeasures have been taken by other countries in retaliation for the usimposed tariffs the tariffs cover products and materials that we import and the countermeasures may affect products we export the effects currently are not material however depending on the breadth of products and materials ultimately affected by and the duration of the tariffs and countermeasures our financial results may be materially harmed in addition countries may impose other restrictions on the importation of products for example in 2018 china imposed stringent purity restrictions on the importation of various types of solid waste allegedly in an effort to reduce environmental pollution 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits 

our operating subsidiaries in our salvage self service and refurbishing operations must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations when we develop or acquire a new facility we must seek the approval of state and local units of government governmental agencies may resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling or refurbishing facility in their communities there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold 

general risks 

our key management personnel are important to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives if we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel which could harm our business in addition to the extent wage inflation occurs in jurisdictions in which we operate we may not be able to retain key employees or we may experience increased costs 

we operate in foreign jurisdictions which exposes us to foreign exchange and other risks 

we have operations in north america europe and taiwan and we may expand our operations in the countries in which we do business and into other countries our foreign operations expose us to additional risks associated with international business which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition including import and export requirements and compliance with anticorruption laws such as the uk bribery act 2010 and the foreign corrupt practices act we also incur costs in currencies other than our functional currencies in some of the countries in which we operate we are thus subject to foreign exchange exposure to the extent that we operate in different currencies as well as exposure to foreign tax and other foreign and domestic laws in addition certain countries in which we operate have a higher level of political instability and criminal activity than the us that could affect our operations and the ability to maintain our supply of products 

our business may be adversely affected by union activities and labor and employment laws 

certain of our employees are represented by labor unions and other employee representative bodies and work under collective bargaining or similar agreements which are subject to periodic renegotiation from time to time there have been efforts to organize additional portions of our workforce and those efforts can be expected to continue in addition legislators and government agencies could adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that could make it significantly easier for unionization efforts to be successful also we may in the future be subject to strikes or work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disruptions and disputes additional unionization efforts new collective bargaining or similar agreements and work stoppages could materially increase our costs and reduce revenue and could limit our flexibility in terms of work schedules reductions in force and other operational matters 

we also are subject to laws and regulations that govern such matters as minimum wage overtime and other working conditions some of these laws are technical in nature and could be subject to interpretation by government agencies and courts different than our interpretations efforts to comply with existing laws changes to such laws and newlyenacted laws may increase our labor costs and limit our flexibility if we were found not to be in compliance with such laws we could be subject to fines penalties and liabilities to our employees or government agencies in addition efforts to better protect local markets from foreign workers and decisions of countries to withdraw from treaties and joint economic areas may lead to increased restrictions on the free movement of people and labor and may limit our ability to place key personnel where they could best serve our needs 

we rely on information technology and communication systems in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business 

in the ordinary course of business we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are provided by or leased from third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans these information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals breaches due to employee error or malfeasance disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware terminations of business relationships by third party service providers power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures terrorist acts natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events involving us or involving the third parties with whom we do business could compromise our or the third parties networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation any of which could adversely affect our business in addition as security threats continue to evolve we will likely need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems 

in the event that we decide to switch providers or to implement upgrades or replacements to our own systems we may be unsuccessful in the development of our own systems or we may underestimate the costs and expenses of switching providers or developing and implementing our own systems also our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an 

alternative system which period could extend longer than we anticipated we are in the midst of a systems conversion project for our european businesses which will be subject to all of these risks 

the costs of complying with the requirements of laws pertaining to the privacy and security of personal information and the potential liability associated with the failure to comply with such laws could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we collect personally identifiable information pii and other data as part of our business processes and operations the legislative and regulatory framework relating to privacy and data protection is rapidly evolving worldwide and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future this data is subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations many foreign countries and governmental bodies including the european union canada and other jurisdictions where we conduct business have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of pii and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions that are more restrictive than those in the us additionally the european union adopted the general data protection regulation gdpr that will impose more stringent data protection requirements for processors and controllers of personal data including expanded disclosures about how pii is to be used limitations on retention of pii mandatory data breach notification requirements and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities the gdpr became effective in may 2018 and there can be no assurance that we have timely implemented all processes required for full compliance with the regulation the gdpr provides severe penalties for noncompliance in addition stricter laws in this area are being enacted in certain states in the us and in other countries and more jurisdictions are likely to follow this trend 

any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection issues even if unfounded or comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations including at newlyacquired companies could result in additional cost and liability to us result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions give rise to civil litigation result in damage to our reputation including the loss of trust by our customers and employees inhibit sales and otherwise adversely affect our business we also may be subject to these adverse effects if other parties with whom we do business including lenders suppliers consultants and advisors violate applicable laws or contractual obligations or suffer a security breach 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our operations the function of our computer systems andor the availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in the closure of our distribution centers or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory through our system on a timely basis this may affect our ability to serve our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the us or into the other countries in which we operate and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks and other vehicles our business could be harmed 

we use a fleet of trucks and other vehicles to deliver the majority of the products we sell we are subject to the risks associated with providing delivery services including inclement weather disruptions in the transportation infrastructure governmental regulation availability and price of fuel liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance and insurance premium increases in addition our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may lose the right to operate at key locations 

we lease most of the properties at which we conduct our businesses at the end of a lease term we must negotiate a renewal exercise a purchase option to the extent we have that right or find a new location there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate renewals on terms acceptable to us or that we will find a suitable alternative location especially with respect to our salvage operations which have characteristics that are often not attractive to landlords local governments or neighbors in such cases we may lose the right to operate at key locations 

activist investors could cause us to incur substantial costs divert management’s attention and have an adverse effect on our business 

we have in the past received and we may in the future be subject to proposals by activist investors urging us to take certain corporate actions activist investor activities could cause our business to be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and other demands by activist investors can be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees for example we have retained and may in the future be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist investor matters including legal financial and communications 

advisors the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results campaigns by activist investors to effect changes at publiclytraded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short term investor value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company perceived uncertainties as to our future direction strategy or leadership that arise as a consequence of activist investor initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities harm our ability to attract new investors employees and business partners and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation

 item 3 legal proceedings 

on may 10 2018 our specialty segment received a notice of violation from the us environmental protection agency epa alleging that certain performancerelated parts that we sold in 2015 2016 and 2017 violated the provisions of the clean air act that prohibit the sale of parts that alter or defeat the emission control system of a motor vehicle the parties have been attempting to negotiate a settlement of this matter without success on january 29 2021 the epa initiated a civil administrative proceeding against us in this matter seeking a monetary penalty for parts sold between january 1 2015 and august 28 2017 any penalty that is likely to be imposed is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

on june 2 2020 we received a notice from the epa regarding alleged violations associated with our npdes stormwater permit at certain of our facilities in massachusetts in december 2020 we reached an agreement to settle the matters relating to three of the facilities for an aggregate fine of approximately 03 million since receiving the notice of violations in june 2020 the epa has requested information from us relating to our npdes stormwater permit compliance in additional locations throughout the us we have responded or are in the process of responding to the requests for information at this time we do not expect that any penalty that could be imposed would have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in addition we are from time to time subject to various claims and lawsuits incidental to our business in the opinion of management currently outstanding claims and suits will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

sources of revenue 

we report our revenue in two categories i parts and services and ii other our parts revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products including replacement parts components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty products and accessories to improve the performance functionality and appearance of vehicles our service revenue is generated primarily from the sale of servicetype warranties fees for admission to our self service yards and diagnostic and repair services during the year ended december 31 2020 parts and services revenue represented approximately 94 of our consolidated revenue revenue from other sources includes scrap and other metals sales bulk sales to mechanical manufacturers including cores and sales of aluminum ingots and sows from our furnace operations other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold see note 5 revenue recognition to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information related to our sources of revenue 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition inventory valuation lease accounting business combinations and goodwill impairment we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue actual results may differ from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

for information regarding our critical accounting policies related to revenue refer to note 5 revenue recognition to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

inventory accounting 

for all inventory carrying value is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value net realizable value can be influenced by current anticipated demand if actual demand differs from our estimates additional reductions to inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made 

for our aftermarket products excluding our aftermarket automotive glass products cost is established based on the average price we pay for parts for our aftermarket automotive glass products inventory cost is established using the firstin firstout method inventory cost for our aftermarket products includes expenses incurred for freight in and overhead costs for items purchased from foreign companies import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included refurbished inventory cost is based upon the average price we pay for cores the cost of our refurbished inventory also includes expenses incurred for freight in labor and other overhead costs our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle including auction towing and storage fees as well as expenditures for buying and dismantling vehicles inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facilitys inventory at expected selling prices the assessment of which incorporates the sales probability based on a parts days in stock and historical demand the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facilitys historical profitability for salvage vehicles remanufactured inventory cost is based upon the price paid for cores and also includes expenses incurred for freight direct manufacturing costs and overhead related to our remanufacturing operations the cost of manufactured product inventory is established using the firstin firstout method 

lease accounting 

for information regarding our critical accounting policies related to leases refer to note 13 leases to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

business combinations 

we record our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values we utilize management estimates and in some instances independent third party valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and contingent consideration granted there are inherent assumptions and estimates used in developing the future cash flows and fair values of tangible and intangible assets such as projecting revenues and profits discount rates income tax rates royalty rates customer attrition rates and other various valuation assumptions we use various valuation 

methods to value property plant and equipment when valuing real property we typically use the sales comparison approach for land and the income approach for buildings and building improvements when valuing personal property we typically use either the income or cost approach we used the relieffromroyalty method to value trade names trademarks software and other technology assets and we used the multiperiod excess earnings method to value customer relationships the relieffromroyalty method assumes that the intangible asset has value to the extent that its owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the intangible asset the multiperiod excess earnings method is based on the present value of the incremental aftertax cash flows attributable only to the customer relationship after deducting contributory asset charges 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles impairment 

we are required to test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually and between annual tests whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist when testing goodwill for impairment we are required to evaluate events and circumstances that may affect the performance of the reporting unit and the extent to which the events and circumstances may impact the future cash flows of the reporting unit to determine whether the fair value of the assets exceeds the carrying value developing the estimated future cash flows and fair value of the reporting unit requires managements judgment in projecting revenues and profits allocation of shared corporate costs tax rates capital expenditures working capital requirements discount rates and market multiples many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates can change in future periods if these assumptions or estimates change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill 

we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist lkq’s market capitalization declined by approximately 40 between february 20 2020 when the company released its 2019 financial results and march 31 2020 while we believed that the decrease was driven by market reaction to covid19 the magnitude of the market capitalization decrease was deemed to be a triggering event requiring an interim test of goodwill impairment in the first quarter which did not result in a goodwill impairment we did not perform an impairment test in the second or third quarters of 2020 

our goodwill impairment assessment is performed at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment or a business one level below an operating segment the component level for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management however components are aggregated as a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics for the purpose of aggregating our components into reporting units we review the longterm performance of segment ebitda additionally we review qualitative factors such as type or class of customers nature of products distribution methods inventory procurement methods level of integration and interdependency of processes across components our assessment of the aggregation includes both qualitative and quantitative factors and is based on the facts and circumstances specific to the components 

we have four operating segments wholesale – north america europe specialty and self service each of these operating segments consists of multiple components that have discrete financial information available that is reviewed by segment management on a regular basis we have evaluated these components and concluded that the components that compose each of the wholesale – north america europe specialty and self service operating segments are economically similar and thus were aggregated into those four separate reporting units for our interim goodwill impairment test in the first quarter of 2020 and annual goodwill impairment test 

our goodwill would be considered impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value the fair value estimates are established using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach we believe that using two methods to determine fair value limits the chances of an unrepresentative valuation discount rates growth rates and cash flow projections are the assumptions that are most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of our reporting units businesses increases in our cost of capital adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including modifications that restrict the activities of our reporting units businesses to assess the reasonableness of the fair value estimates we compare the sum of the reporting units’ fair values to the company’s market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium which is then evaluated against recent market transactions in our industry or in the case of our interim test against transactions during the 20082009 financial crisis if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results 

we determined no impairments existed on any of our four reporting units when we performed our interim goodwill impairment testing in the first quarter of 2020 as each of those reporting units had a fair value estimate that exceeded the carrying value by at least 12 the level at which our europe reporting unit exceeded its carrying value we did not identify a triggering event in the second or third quarter that necessitated an interim test of goodwill impairment 

we determined no impairments existed when we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2020 on all four reporting units as each of those reporting units had a fair value estimate that exceeded the carrying value by at least 30 as of december 31 2020 we had a total of 46 billion in goodwill subject to future impairment tests 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in the first quarter of 2020 we determined that the effect of the uncertainty relating to the covid19 pandemic on our forecasted results represented a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the warn trademark which is our only indefinitelived intangible asset might not be recoverable as a result we performed a quantitative impairment test as of march 31 2020 using the relieffromroyalty method and determined no impairment existed as the trademark had a fair value estimate which exceeded the carrying value by approximately 9 we did not identify a triggering event in the second or third quarter that necessitated an interim test of impairment we performed a quantitative impairment test in the fourth quarter as of october 31 2020 using the relieffromroyalty method to value the warn trademark we determined no impairment existed at that time as the trademark had a fair value estimate which exceeded the carrying value by approximately 13

1 lkq europe program 

we have undertaken the 1 lkq europe program to create structural centralization and standardization of key functions to facilitate the operation of the europe segment as a single business under this multiyear program we expect to recognize the following 

• restructuring expenses — nonrecurring costs resulting directly from the implementation of the 1 lkq europe program from which the business will derive no ongoing benefit see note 6 “restructuring and acquisition related expenses” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further details 

• transformation expenses — period costs incurred to execute the 1 lkq europe program that are expected to contribute to ongoing benefits to the business eg noncapitalizable implementation costs related to a common erp system these expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses 

• transformation capital expenditures — capitalizable costs for longlived assets such as software and facilities that directly relate to the execution of the 1 lkq europe program 

costs related to the 1 lkq europe program incurred to date are reflected in selling general and administrative expenses and purchases of property plant and equipment in our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k beginning in the second half of march 2020 management delayed certain projects under the 1 lkq europe program to reduce expenses and preserve capital in response to the covid19 pandemic based on our expectations in the second quarter of 2020 that the impacts on our business from covid19 had stabilized we restarted the program in july 2020 with substantially the same initiatives and projects as prior to the pandemic while certain projects were delayed as a result of the covid19 pandemic such as our procurement initiatives and the new headquarters in switzerland we also accelerated certain projects such as the integration of previously acquired networks and sharing resources across lkq europe we have continued the project on schedule during the second wave of covid19 we are targeting to complete the organizational design and implementation projects by the middle of 2021 with the remaining projects scheduled to be completed by 2024 during the year ended december 31 2020 we incurred 38 million in costs across all three categories noted above we expect that costs of the program reflecting all three categories noted above will range between 60 million and 80 million in 2021 with an additional 80 million to 100 million between 2022 and the projected program completion date in 2024 in the future we may also identify additional initiatives and projects under the 1 lkq europe program that may result in additional expenditures although we are currently unable to estimate the range of charges for such potential future initiatives and projects we expect the transformation and restructuring expenses will be entirely funded by the improved trade working capital initiatives across our europe segment 

covid19 impact on our operations 

in late february 2020 the italian government began placing restrictions on activity as a result of the covid19 outbreak sales volumes fell as fewer cars were on the road and less maintenance activity was performed while our italian operation is an important part of our european business it represented approximately 10 of the segment’s revenue in 2019 and thus the disruption did not have a material impact on the company by midmarch the covid19 impact began spreading across the rest of the geographies where we operate at a very rapid pace governments adopted aggressive restrictions on the operation of nonessential businesses and personal movement which reduced miles driven and collisions while our businesses have been deemed essential in most jurisdictions in which we operate the change in behavior driven by the covid19 restrictions negatively impacted our sales volume our organic parts and services revenue declined by 168 45 and 52 in the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 respectively relative to the comparable prior periods we showed improvement in the third quarter of 2020 as governments gradually lifted restrictions for nonessential businesses and personal movement however in the fourth quarter of 2020 revenue declined as certain jurisdictions put restrictions back into place as anticipated april experienced the most negative revenue impact with organic parts and services revenue on a per day basis down 303 compared to the prior year period as movement restrictions lessened in may and june we experienced organic parts and services revenue declines on a per day basis of 132 and 73 respectively compared to the prior year periods however the pace of improvement flattened into the third quarter as the increasing level of covid19 cases especially in the united states slowed the recovery during the third quarter organic parts and services revenue declined by 45 compared to the prior year period a small improvement from the june decline of 73 on a per day basis during the fourth quarter organic parts and services revenue declined by 61 on a per day basis and gradually worsened during the quarter with a decline of 72 on a per day basis in december in the first quarter of 2021 we expect revenue to remain lower on a year over year basis as covid19 continues to impact economic activity in the us and europe as the pandemic did not begin meaningfully impacting our results until march 2020 the level of the year over year decrease in revenue will depend on the extent of lockdown measures taken in response to an increase in the prevalence of the virus outbreak and the timing and effectiveness of the vaccination efforts we expect revenue to increase in the second quarter of 2021 off of a low base and a gradual recovery in the second half of 2021 

recognizing the demand changes in the first quarter of 2020 we took action in all of our business units to reduce our cost structure these actions included but were not limited to employee furloughs and reductions in force decreases in hours and overtime lowering compensation for salaried employees a hiring freeze elimination of temporary labor route consolidation deferral of projects and temporary branch closures in the second quarter these cost actions contributed to a reduction of approximately 18 in quarterly selling general and administrative expenses compared to our first quarter 2020 run rate we estimate that the cost actions generated a 10 million benefit in cost of goods sold compared to our second quarter of 2019 some of the savings from the cost actions were delayed as we paid out vacation balances in april and covered medical benefits for employees in the united states during their furlough period during the third quarter and fourth quarters we were able to sustain a portion of the cost benefits with quarterly selling general and administrative costs down approximately 10 for both periods compared to the first quarter 2020 run rate we estimate that the cost actions generated an approximately 15 million benefit in cost of goods sold for the second half of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 if revenue increases during 2021 we expect that some of the costs that were reduced as a result of covid19 will remain at a lower level the management team has been implementing productivity initiatives to create lower cost structures going forward as seen in the third and fourth quarter results 

we pursued certain financial assistance and relief programs that were available to us from governments in europe and canada primarily in the form of grants to offset personnel expenses through december 31 2020 we qualified for 52 million of assistance although that figure was heavily weighted to the second quarter we currently do not anticipate qualifying for significant additional assistance in 2021 but we still will receive some government assistance in england this view may change in the future based on developments with the resurgence of the virus outbreak 

these cost actions lagged the revenue impact in the first and second quarters which meant there was a negative timing impact of covid19 on our profitability in those periods in addition to the negative effect from reduced revenue by the third quarter the cost actions were aligned with the revenue changes and we generated higher segment ebitda dollars and margins than in the third quarter of 2019 in the fourth quarter selling general and administrative sga costs remained consistent with the third quarter and profitability remained higher than the prior year 

we also emphasized the preservation of capital with a deferral of growth driven capital projects reductions in inventory orders more active monitoring of customer receivables and terms income and value added tax payment deferrals the majority of which were paid during the third quarter and suspension of our share buyback program which was reinstated during the fourth quarter this focus was successful as we improved our liquidity position at yearend by approximately 10 billion relative to march 31 2020 while managing through the disruption caused by the pandemic 

in each quarter of 2020 we prepared forecasts of future revenues profits and cash flows to use in multiple analyses including the interim and annual goodwill impairment test other impairment tests of longlived assets assessments of the 

recoverability of inventory determination of customer and supplier rebate balances calculation of the annual effective tax rate and evaluations of the realizability of deferred tax assets actual results have exceeded our initial forecast prepared in the first quarter of 2020 with a full year organic parts and service revenue decline of 82 on a per day basis diluted earnings per share attributable to lkq stockholders of 209 and operating cash flow of 14 billion we expect to face continued pressure on revenue with covid19 infection rates remaining at heightened levels in a number of our geographies but we believe that consolidated profit margins in 2021 will remain above those realized during 2020 due to margin and overhead cost initiatives implemented in 2019 and 2020 as the economic impact of the pandemic is dependent on variables that are difficult to project and in many cases are outside of our control it is possible that the estimates underlying our analyses may change this is particularly the case as it appears that the prevalence of the virus outbreak fluctuates depending on various factors including the level of economic and social activity in a region and progress in vaccination efforts 

one of our top priorities is the health and safety of our employees customers and the communities in which we operate we are using all reasonable efforts to follow governmental instructions and safety guidelines with respect to the operations of our facilities we have implemented protocols across our business units to help ensure the health and safety of our employees customers and communities including but not limited to restricting access to and enhancing cleaning and disinfecting protocols at our facilities use of personal protective equipment adhering to social distancing guidelines instituting remote work arrangements for many of our employees and restricting travel 

see the results of operations and liquidity sections for further detail on our year over year trends 

key performance indicators 

we believe that organic revenue growth segment ebitda and free cash flow are key performance indicators for our business segment ebitda is our key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker free cash flow is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “nongaap” 

• organic revenue growth  we define organic revenue growth as total revenue growth from continuing operations excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures ie revenue generated from the date of acquisition to the first anniversary of that acquisition net of reduced revenue due to the disposal of businesses and foreign currency movements ie impact of translating revenue at prior period exchange rates organic revenue growth includes incremental sales from both existing and new ie opened within the last twelve months locations and is derived from expanding business with existing customers securing new customers and offering additional products and services we believe that organic revenue growth is a key performance indicator as this statistic measures our ability to serve and grow our customer base successfully 

• segment ebitda  refer to note 16 segment and geographic information” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for a description of the calculation of segment ebitda we believe that segment ebitda provides useful information to evaluate our segment profitability by focusing on the indicators of ongoing operational results 

• free cash flow  we calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property plant and equipment free cash flow provides insight into our liquidity and provides useful information to management and investors concerning cash flow available to meet our future debt service obligations and working capital requirements to make strategic acquisitions and to repurchase our stock 

these three key performance indicators are used as targets in determining incentive compensation at various levels of the organization including senior management by using these performance measures we attempt to motivate a balanced approach to the business that rewards growth profitability and cash flow generation in a manner that enhances our longterm prospects

we have presented the growth of our revenue and profitability in our operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis the constant currency presentation which is a nongaap measure excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth and profitability consistent with how we evaluate our performance as this statistic removes the translation impact of exchange rate fluctuations which are outside of our control and do not reflect our operational performance constant currency revenue and segment ebitda results are calculated by translating prior year revenue and segment ebitda in local currency using the current years currency conversion rate this nongaap financial measure has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap our use of this term may vary from the use of similarlytitled measures by other issuers due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation in addition not all companies that report revenue or profitability on a constant currency basis calculate such measures in the same manner as we do and accordingly our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarlynamed measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies 

the following table presents our financial performance including third party revenue total revenue and segment ebitda by reportable segment for the periods indicated in thousands 



the key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker our chief executive officer is segment ebitda we use segment ebitda to compare profitability among our segments and evaluate business strategies segment ebitda includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment corporate general and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage with shared expenses apportioned based on the segments percentage of consolidated revenue we calculate segment ebitda as ebitda excluding restructuring and acquisition related expenses which includes restructuring expenses recorded in cost of goods sold change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities other gains and losses related to acquisitions equity method investments or divestitures equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and impairment charges ebitda which is the basis for segment ebitda is calculated as net income attributable to lkq stockholders excluding discontinued operations and discontinued noncontrolling interest depreciation amortization interest which includes gains and losses on debt extinguishment and income tax expense see note 16 segment and geographic information to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a reconciliation of total segment ebitda to net income

north america 

third party revenue  the following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our north america segment in thousands 



1 parts and services organic revenue declined despite one additional selling day in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year period on a per day basis organic revenue declined 133 the organic decline was impacted by collision and liability repairable auto claims which according to data from ccc were 260 lower for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year period this decrease in claims activity was primarily due to the covid19 pandemic and had an adverse impact on sales volumes in our wholesale operations the volume decline in collision parts was partially offset by an outperformance of the claims trend attributable to share gains mechanical part sales and self service parts sales and admissions prior to the pandemic parts and services organic revenue in north america was slightly less than the same period in the prior year declining 11 through february 2020 principally due to i the termination in the fourth quarter of 2019 of an agreement signed in december 2017 for the distribution of batteries which had an unfavorable impact of 08 through february 2020 compared to the prior year period and ii to a lesser extent milder winter weather conditions compared to the prior year period during the period of march 2020 through december 2020 parts and services organic revenue declined 156 on a per day basis compared to the prior year period primarily due to volume effects caused by the covid19 pandemic collision and liability repairable auto claims were down approximately 417 244 and 272 in the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 respectively according to data from ccc going into the first quarter of 2021 we anticipate downward pressures on aftermarket fill rates due to continued ocean freight delays which in turn may adversely impact sales 

2 the 33 million year over year organic increase in other revenue is primarily related to a 106 million increase in revenue from precious metals platinum palladium and rhodium primarily due to higher prices compared to the prior year partially offset by i a 46 million decrease in revenue from other scrap metals eg aluminum and fluids due to lower volumes ii an 18 million decrease in revenue from scrap steel due to lower prices and volumes and iii a decrease in core revenue of 9 million due to lower volumes the volume declines in other revenue were due to lower purchase volumes and throughput in our salvage and self service operations as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

3 acquisition related growth for the year ended december 31 2020 reflected revenue from our acquisition of three wholesale businesses and one self service business since the beginning of 2019 through the oneyear anniversary of the acquisitions reduced revenue as a result of the disposal of our aviation business in the third quarter of 2019 more than offset the acquisition growth during this period 

segment ebitda segment ebitda increased 66 million or 92 in the year ended december 31 2020 including the impact of one additional selling day compared to the prior year period the adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic on sales volumes in our wholesale operations had a significant unfavorable impact on segment ebitda this adverse impact was more than offset in part due to operational efficiency and rightsizing actions and higher revenue from precious metals net sequential increases in scrap steel prices in our salvage and self service operations had a 16 million favorable impact on north america segment ebitda during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to a 23 million unfavorable impact during the year ended december 31 2019 resulting from net sequential decreases in scrap steel prices this favorable impact for the year ended december 31 2020 resulted from the increase in scrap steel prices between the date we purchased a vehicle which influences the price we pay for a vehicle and the date we scrapped a vehicle which influences the price we receive for scrapping a vehicle 

the following table summarizes the changes in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue in our north america segment 



1 the increase in gross margin primarily reflected favorable impa cts of 12 from our wholesale operations and 04 from our self service operations despite the adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic on sales volumes in our wholesale operations wholesale gross margin was favorable primarily due to the positive impact of cost reductions from operational efficiency and rightsizing actions higher prices of precious metals and scrap steel and improved return rates compared to the prior year period the increase in self service gross margin was primarily attributable to higher prices of precious metals as well as sequential increases in scrap steel prices we expect downward pressure on our salvage and self service margins going into 2021 as purchase costs increased in the second half of 2020 due to the reduced availability of cars for purchase reflecting the impact of the covid19 pandemic we plan to continue to address this downward pressure through price adjustments and further operational efficiencies we expect commodity prices to have a favorable impact on margin at least in the shortterm as precious metals and scrap prices hold or improve from recent levels 

2 the decrease in segment operating expense as a percentage of revenue despite the deleveraging impact of the organic revenue parts and services revenue decline of 133 compared to the prior year on a per day basis reflects i a favorable impact o f 16 from personnel expenses related to permanent and temporary headcount reductions reduced hours limitations on travel and governm ent grants in canada and ii a 02 favorable impact from vehicle and fuel expenses due to fuel usage and prices the impact was partially offset by a negative leverage effect of 05 from facility expenses which are largely fixed as the market recovers and volumes increase we expect to bring back necessary resources to support our operations however we expect that permanent actions taken this year will provide a longterm favorable impact for the segment 

europe 

third party revenue  the following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our europe segment in thousands 



1 the parts and services organic revenue decrease for the year ended december 31 2020 was partially offset by having two additional selling days in 2020 compa red to the year ended december 31 2019  on a per day basis organic parts and services revenue decreased 69 mainly driven by the covid19 pandemic disruptions in all of our european operations prior to the pandemic organic revenue in europe had increased 03 through february principally driven by the central and eastern european region and to a lesser extent germany during the period of march 2020 through december 2020 organic revenue declined 83 on a per day basis compared to the prior year period primarily due to volume effects caused by the covid19 pandemic germany and the netherlands have been recovering at a faster rate with the recovery in italy and the uk laggi ng behind 

2 acquisition related growth for the year ended december 31 2020 reflected revenue from our acquisition of three immaterial wholesale businesses since the beginning of 2019 through the oneyear anniversary of the acquisitions reduced revenue as a result of the disposals of a noncore telecommunications operation in germany in the second 

quarter of 2020 and two smaller disposals during 2020 and a wholesale business in bulgaria in the third quarter of 2019 more than offset the acquisition growth  

3 compared to the prior year exchange rates increased our revenue growth by 62 million  or 11  primarily due to the weaker us dollar against the euro and pound sterling during the year ended december 31 2020 relative to the prior year period 

segment ebitda  segment ebitda decreased 27 million  or 59  for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year period our europe segment ebitda included a positive year over year impact of 6 million related to the translation of local currency results into us dollars at higher exchange rates than those experienced during the year ended december 31 2019 on a constant currency basis ie excluding the translation impact segment ebitda decreased by 32 million  or 71  compared to the prior year refer to the foreign currency impact discussion within the results of operations–consolidated section above for further detail regarding foreign currency impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2020 



1 the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to favorable impacts of i 02 across almost all our operations principally as a result of margin improvement initiatives supporting the pursuit of profitable revenue growth and ii 02 from the disposal of a noncore telecommunications operation in germany in the second quarter of 2020  

2 the increase in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects unfavorable impacts of i 02 from bad debt expense due to the downturn in economic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic ii 02 in transformation expenses related to the 1 lkq europe program and iii several individually immaterial factors that had an unfavorable impact of 04 in the aggregate these negative impacts were partially mitigated by actions to reduce personnel expense which generated a favorable impact of 03  despite the deleveraging impact from the third party parts and services organic revenue decline of 69 on a per day basis management was able to utilize government assistance permanent and temporary headcount reductions and limited travel expenses to achieve this 03 reduction as a percentage of revenue as the markets recovered from the second quarter low point volumes increased and government programs ceased we brought back necessary resources to support our operations however we expect that permanent actions taken this year will provide a longterm favorable impact for the segment 

specialty 

third party revenue  the following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our specialty segment in thousands 



1 parts and services organic revenue increased 30 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year on a per day basis organic revenue increas ed 26 t he organic increa se was primarily due to strong demand for recreational vehicle products and high drop ship fulfillment we believe that organic growth was constrained by the 

impact of availability issues at certain suppliers that were not able to meet our demand due to the covid19 pandemic 

segment ebitda  segment ebitda increased 1 million or 09 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year 

the following table summarizes the changes in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue in our specialty segment 



1 the decrease in gross margin primarily reflects unfavorable impacts of i 07 due t o unfavorable product and channel mix for the year ended december 31 2020 and ii 04 driven by higher product cost due to lower supplier discounts received in the current year compared to the prior year partially offset by a favorable impact of iii 05 due to freight income reflecting higher shipping and handling fees tied to increased usage of third party carriers the offsetting delivery cost is a component of freight expense as mentioned below in the operating expenses discussion 

2 the decrease in se gment operating expenses reflects a favorable impact of i 12 in personnel costs due to reduced headcount and reduced hours partially offset by ii a 05 unfavorable impact in freight vehicle and fuel expenses due to an increased use of third party freight and iii several individually immaterial factors that had an unfavorable impact of 02 in the aggregate 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes liquidity data as of the dates indicated in thousands 



1 debt amounts reflect the gross values to be repaid excluding debt issuance costs of 26 million and 30 million as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively 

2 debt amounts reflect the gross values to be repaid excluding debt issuance costs of immaterial amounts as of both december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 

3 capacity under credit facilities includes our revolving credit facilities and our receivables securitization facility availability under credit facilities is reduced by our outstanding letters of credit 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through both internal development and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our credit facilities we utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures with the excess amounts going towards funding acquisitions paying down outstanding debt or repurchasing our common stock as we have pursued acquisitions as part of our historical growth strategy our cash flows from operations have not always been sufficient to cover our investing activities to fund our acquisitions we have accessed various forms of debt financing including revolving credit facilities senior notes and a receivables securitization facility 

as of december 31 2020 we had debt outstanding and additional available sources of financing as follows 

• senior secured credit facilities maturing in january 2024 composed of term loans totaling 350 million 324 million outstanding at december 31 2020 and 315 billion in revolving credit 643 million outstanding at december 31 2020 bearing interest at variable rates although a portion of the outstanding debt is hedged through interest rate swap contracts with availability reduced by 71 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit 

• euro notes 2024 totaling 611 million €500 million maturing in april 2024 and bearing interest at a 3875 fixed rate 

• euro notes 202628 totaling 12 billion €10 billion consisting of i €750 million maturing in april 2026 and bearing interest at a 3625 fixed rate and ii €250 million maturing in april 2028 and bearing interest at a 4125 fixed rate 

• receivables securitization facility with availability up to 110 million no outstanding balance as of december 31 2020 maturing in november 2021 and bearing interest at variable commercial paper rates 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 25 billion available under our credit facilities combined with 312 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2020 we had approximately 29 billion in available liquidity an increase of 413 million from our available liquidity as of december 31 2019 

we believe that our current liquidity and cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements to support our liquidity position during the covid19 pandemic we focused on preserving cash during the expected period of reduced demand our action plan to strengthen our liquidity position included a deferral of growth driven capital projects reductions in inventory orders more active monitoring of customer receivables and terms income and value added tax deferrals and suspension of our share buyback program in addition to the cost saving measures discussed in the covid19 impact on our operations section above given our success in strengthening our liquidity position as of september 30 2020 we recommenced our share buyback program during the fourth quarter of 2020 however due to the rapidly evolving global situation it is not possible to predict whether unanticipated consequences of the covid19 pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity and capital resources negatively in the future 

with 29 billion of total liquidity as of december 31 2020 and 59 million of current maturities we have access to funds to meet our near term commitments even if the pandemic effect extends longer than our current expectations we have a surplus of current assets over current liabilities which further reduces the risk of short term cash shortfalls 

our capital preservation plans delivered the desired results as we repaid approxima tely 327 million in borrowings from free cash flows generated in the fourth quarter as well as cash on hand and overall in 2020 repaid approximately 14 billion in borrowings our total liquidity has increased by 997 million sinc e march 31 2020 which we believe puts us in position to manage through the pandemic 

our total liquidity inclu des availability under our senior secured credit facility which includes the two financial maintenance covenants presented below our required debt covenants and our actual ratios with respect to those covenants as calculated per the credit agreement as of december 31 2020 



the terms net leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio used in the credit agreement are specifically calculated per the credit agreement and differ in specified ways from comparable gaap or common usage terms 

we amended our senior secured credit facility in june 2020 to increase the maximum net leverage ratio effective with our compliance certificate filed with respect to the second quarter of 2020 refer to senior secured credit agreement in note 10 longterm obligations to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information on the june 2020 amendment we entered into the amendment out of an abundance of caution to reduce the risk of breaching the net leverage covenant if the pandemic had a severe and extended effect on profitability our internal models from the first quarter of 2020 suggested that we would be able to meet our payment obligations during the pandemic but there was a risk that we might exceed the maximum 40x net leverage ratio in the event a severe downside scenario developed with the amendment and the better than forecasted perform ance since the pandemic began we believ e that we have significantly reduced 

the risk of a covenant breach including by reducing our net leverage ratio further in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 relative to the second quarter 

the indentures relating to our euro notes d o not include financial maintenance covenants and the indentures will not restrict our ability to draw funds on the credit facility the indentures do not prohibit amendments to the financial covenants under the credit facility as needed 

in the long term while we believe that we have adequate capacity under our existing credit facilities from time to time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements there can be no assurance that additional funding or refinancing of our credit facilities if needed will be available on terms attractive to us or at all furthermore any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants or higher interest costs our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

from time to time we may undertake financing transactions to increase our available liquidity such as i our november 2018 amendment to our senior secured credit facility and ii the issuance of the euro notes 202628 in april 2018 related to the stahlgruber acquisition given the longterm nature of our investment in stahlgruber combined with favorable interest rates we decided to fund the acquisition primarily through longterm fixed rate notes we believe this approach provides financial flexibility to execute our longterm growth strategy while maintaining availability under our revolver if we see an attractive acquisition opportunity we have the ability to use our revolver to move quickly and have certainty of funding up to the amount of our thenavailable liquidity in january 2020 we redeemed our us notes 2023 to eliminate higher cost debt with lower interest rate borrowings on our credit facilities and cash on hand 

beginning in 2019 a number of our european suppliers began participating in a supply chain financing initiative in select countries under which they may sell their accounts receivable to the participating financial institutions allowing us to extend payment terms which in turn improves our operating cash flows the initiative allows our suppliers to monetize the receivables prior to their payment date subject to payment of a discount we expect more suppliers will begin participating in our european supply chain financing initiative in 2021 financial institutions participate in the supply chain financing initiative on an uncommitted basis and can cease purchasing receivables from our suppliers at any time the initiative is at the sole discretion of both the supplier and the financial institution on terms that are negotiated between them in the future if the financial institutions did not continue to purchase receivables from our suppliers under the initiative the participating vendors may have a need to renegotiate their payment terms with us which in turn could cause our borrowings under our revolving credit facility to increase all outstanding payments owed under the initiative to the participating financial institutions are recorded within accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets 

borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at variable rates which are tied to libor or the canadian dollar offered rate cdor depending on the currency and the duration of the borrowing plus an applicable margin rate that is subject to change quarterly based on our reported leverage ratio we hold interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates on a portion of our credit agreement borrowings with the effect of fixing the interest rates on the respective notional amounts in addition we hold currency swaps that contain an interest rate swap component and a foreign currency forward contract component that when combined with related intercompany financing arrangements effectively convert variable rate us dollardenominated borrowings into fixed rate eurodenominated borrowings these derivative transactions are described in note 11 derivative instruments and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k after giving effect to these contracts the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2020 was 17 including our senior notes our overall weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 31 at december 31 2020 

after 2021 it is unclear whether banks will continue to provide libor submissions to the administrator of libor at this time no consensus exists as to which reference rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor although the alternative reference rates committee a group of market participants convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york has identified the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as the recommended alternative to libor on november 30 2020 ice benchmark administration the administrator of libor with the support of the united states federal reserve and the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of usd libor on december 31 2021 for the one week and two month usd libor tenors and on june 30 2023 for all other usd libor tenors while this announcement extends the transition period to june 2023 the united states federal reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new usd libor issuances by the end of 2021 we cannot currently predict the effect of the discontinuation of or other changes to libor or any establishment of alternative reference rates in the united states the european union or elsewhere on the global capital markets outstanding debt under our credit agreement which constitutes the most significant of our liborbased debt obligations contains provisions that address the potential discontinuation of libor and facilitate the adoption of an alternative rate of interest we do not believe that the discontinuation of libor or its replacement with an alternative reference rate or rates such as the sofr will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or liquidity 

cash interest payments were 107 million for the year ended december 31 2020 including 64 million in semiannual interest payments on our euro notes 2024 and euro notes 20262028 interest payments on our euro notes 2024 and euro notes 20262028 are made in april and october 

we had outstanding credit agreement borrowings of 967 million and 16 billion at december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively of these amounts 18 million was classified as current maturities at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the scheduled maturities of longterm obligations outstanding at december 31 2020 are as follows in thousands 



1 maturities of longterm obligations due by december 31 2021 includes 24 million of shortterm debt that may be extended beyond the current due date 

2 the total debt amounts presented above reflect the gross values to be repaid excluding debt issuance costs of 26 million as of december 31 2020 

our credit agreement contains customary covenants that impose limitations and conditions on our ability to enter into certain transactions the credit agreement also contains financial and affirmative covenants including limitations on our net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our credit agreement as of december 31 2020 

as of december 31 2020 the company had cash and cash equivalents of 312 million of which 275 million was held by foreign subsidiaries in general it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and that position has not changed following the enactment of the tax act and the related imposition of the transition tax distributions of dividends from our foreign subsidiaries if any would be generally exempt from further us taxation either as a result of the 100 participation exemption under the tax act or due to the previous taxation of foreign earnings under the transition tax and the gilti regime we believe that we have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our financial obligations in the us without repatriating our foreign earnings we may from time to time choose to selectively repatriate foreign earnings if doing so supports our financing or liquidity objectives 

the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds we normally pay for aftermarket product purchases on standard payment terms or at the time of shipment depending on the manufacturer and the negotiated payment terms we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles 

the following table sets forth a summary of our aftermarket and manufactured inventory procurement for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 in thousands 



1 inventory purchases across all segments have decreased due to a slowdown in procurement beginning in march 2020 as a response to the covid19 pandemic 

2 the decrease in inventory purchases in our europe segment was partially offset by an increase of 71 million attributable to the increase in the value of the euro and to a lesser extent the pound sterling in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year period 

the following table sets forth a summary of our global wholesale salvage and self service procurement of vehicles for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 in thousands 



salvage purchases decreased relative to the prior year as we reduced buying to reflect lower demand during the covid19 pandemic purchasing began to increase as the second quarter progressed and revenue increased and continued to increase through the fourth quarter self service vehicle purchases declined due to supply constraints as certain outlets such as city impound lots were unavailable for a portion of the year and individuals held onto vehicles longer during the lockdown measures purchases increased towards the end of june 2020 and continued to increase through the end of the fourth quarter 

we expect to continue to increase inventory purchases in the first quarter of 2021 to support the service and fill rate requirements of our businesses based on the revenue trend and expectations for 2021 including normal seasonality as we continue into winter however we expect to be able to operate effectively at a lower inventory balance than at the end of 2019 

the following table summarizes the components of the yearoveryear increase in cash provided by operating activities in millions 



1 refer to the results of operations – consolidated section for further information on the increase in operating income 

2 refer to net assets held for sale in note 4 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information on the net impairment activity recorded for the years ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 

3 cash payments related to income taxes increased for us federal and state income taxes due to i 94 million increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes ii tax payment benefits from the loss on disposal of our aviation business in 2019 and iii 2018 overpayment credits carried forward into 2019 

4 cash flows related to our primary working capital accounts can be volatile as the purchases payments and collections can be timed differently from period to period 

receivables net w as a 67 million grea ter infl ow in 2020 primarily due to greater cash conversion of accounts receivable balances in the year 2020 in the europe segment of 60 million and the north america segment of 38 million and the lower revenues due to the covid19 pandemic the inflows in north america and europe were partially offset by outflows for the specialty segment of 31 million as a result of increased revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020 

inventories represented 418 million in incremental cash inflows in the year 2020 as a result of inventory decreases in the i europe segment of 167 million ii north america segment of 141 million and iii specialty segment of 110 million due to a slowdown in inventory purchases starting in march 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic as we aligned our inventory balances to the projected demand 

accounts payable produced 68 million in higher cash outflows primarily due to lower accounts payable balances in the north america segment of 259 million and the specialty segment of 8 million compared to the prior year period as a result of a slowdown in inventory purchases due to the covid19 pandemic partially offset by cash inflows for the europe segment of 199 million primarily due to benefits from both improved payment terms and our supply chain financing initiative 

5 cash flows from other operating activities decreased 18 million as a result of the timing of value added tax payables payments compared to the prior year the remaining amount reflects a number of individually insignificant fluctuations in cash paid for other operating activities 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 166 million and 265 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively property plant and equipment purchases were 173 million in 2020 compared to 266 million in the prior year the period over period decrease in cash outflows for purchases of property plant and equipment was due to decreased capital spending across our businesses as a result of the covid19 pandemic we invested 7 million of cash net of cash acquired in business acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 27 million during the year ended december 31 2019 we received 22 million of net proceeds from divestitures of businesses held for sale and property plant and equipment during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 35 million in the prior year period 

the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow in thousands 



net cash used in financing activities totaled 15 billion and 601 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively during the year ended december 31 2020 net repayments of our borrowings totaled 14 billion compared to 301 million during the year ended december 31 2019 the period over period increase in net repayments of our borrowings includes the 600 million repayment of our us notes 2023 in january 2020 we repurchased 117 million of our common stock in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 292 million in the year ended december 31 2019 

although our efforts are currently scaled back due to the covid19 pandemic we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of distribution centers processing and sales facilities and warehouses through further integration of our facilities and through selected business acquisitions our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions 

offbalance sheet arrangements and future commitments 

except as described below we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements or undisclosed borrowings or debt that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to item 303 of regulation sk under the securities exchange act of 1934 additionally we do not have any synthetic leases 

as of december 31 2020 there were letters of credit outstanding in the aggregate amount of 71 million 

we guarantee the residual values for the majority of our leased vehicles had we terminated all of our operating leases subject to these guarantees at december 31 2020 our portion of the guaranteed residual value would have totaled approximately 63 million see note 13 leases to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on leases 

in december 2019 we modified the shares of a noncontrolling interest of a subsidiary acquired in connection with the stahlgruber acquisition and issued new redeemable shares to the minority shareholder the new redeemable shares contain a put option for all noncontrolling interest shares at a fixed price of 24 million €21 million for the minority shareholder exercisable in the fourth quarter of 2023 the put option is outside the control of the company to exercise see stockholders

the following table represents our future commitments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 in millions 



1 our longterm debt under contractual obligations above includes interest of 436 million on the balances outstanding as of december 31 2020 the longterm debt balance excludes debt issuance costs as these expenses have already been paid interest on our senior notes notes payable and other longterm debt is calculated based on the respective stated rates interest on our variable rate credit facilities is calculated based on the weighted average rates including the impact of interest rate swaps through their respective expiration dates in effect for each tranche of borrowings as of december 31 2020 future estimated interest expense for the next year one to three years and three to five years is 94 million 185 million and 100 million respectively estimated interest expense beyond five years is 57 million 

2 interest on finance lease obligations of 12 million is included based on incremental borrowing or implied rates future estimated interest expense for the next year one to three years and three to five years is 1 million 1 million and 1 million respectively estimated interest expense beyond five years is 9 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in 

• foreign exchange rates 

• interest rates and 

• commodity prices 

foreign exchange rates 

foreign currency fluctuations may impact the financial results we report for the portions of our business that operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar our operations outside of the us represented 505 and 503 of our revenue during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively an increase or decrease in the strength of the us dollar against these currencies by 10 would result in a 51 change in our consolidated revenue and a 26 change in our operating income for the year ended december 31 2020 see our results of operations discussion in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our year over year results 

additionally we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket products from foreign countries primarily in europe and asia to the extent that our inventory purchases are not denominated in the functional currency of the purchasing location we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in several of our operations we purchase inventory from manufacturers in taiwan in us dollars which exposes us to fluctuations in the relationship between the local functional currency and the us dollar as well as fluctuations between the us dollar and the taiwan dollar we hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations related to a portion of inventory purchases in our europe operations but the notional amount and fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2020 were immaterial we do not currently attempt to hedge foreign currency exposure related to our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in our north america operations and we may not be able to pass on any resulting price increases to our customers 

to the extent that we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations related to nonfunctional currency denominated financing transactions we may hedge the exposure through the use of foreign currency forward contracts as of december 31 2020 we held short term foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of €142 million £75 million and sek 227 million only the sek denominated foreign currency forward contract was designated as a cash flow hedge the fair value was a liability of 1 million as of december 31 2020 in february 2021 we entered into a short term foreign currency forward contract for 250 million to mitigate our exposure to nonfunctional currency borrowings in our european operations we currently expect to enter into a similar instrument when this one matures in the first quarter of 2021 the values of these contracts are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

other than with respect to a portion of our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases and certain financing transactions we do not hold derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency risk our net investment in foreign operations is partially hedged by the foreign currency denominated borrowings we use to fund foreign acquisitions however our ability to use foreign currency denominated borrowings to finance our foreign operations may be limited based on local tax laws we have elected not to hedge the foreign currency risk related to the interest payments on foreign third party borrowings as we generate cash flows in the local currencies that can be used to fund debt payments as of december 31 2020 we had outstanding borrowings of €500 million under our euro notes 2024 and €10 billion under our euro notes 202628 we had no foreign borrowings under our revolving credit facilities as of december 31 2019 we had outstanding borrowings of €500 million under our euro notes 2024 €10 billion under our euro notes 202628 and £208 million €229 million cad 130 million and sek 270 million under our revolving credit facilities 

interest rates 

our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facilities where interest rates are tied to the prime rate libor or cdor therefore we implemented a policy to manage our exposure to variable interest rates on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt instruments through the use of interest rate swap contracts these contracts convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt matching the currency effective dates and maturity dates to specific debt instruments we designate our interest rate swap contracts as cash flow hedges and net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swap contracts are included as adjustments to interest expense 

as of december 31 2020 we held interest rate swap contracts with a total notional amount of 480 million maturing in january 2021 and june 2021 150 million remains outstanding as of the filing date of this annual report on form 10k all of our interest rate swap contracts have been executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy wells fargo bank na bank of america na citizens na hsbc bank usa na and banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria sa as of december 31 2020 the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was a liability of 1 million the values of such contracts are subject to changes in interest rates 

in addition to these interest rate swaps as of december 31 2020 we held cross currency swap agreements for a total notional amount of €340 million with maturity dates in january 2021 these cross currency swaps contain an interest rate swap component and a foreign currency forward contract component that combined with related intercompany financing arrangements effectively convert variable rate us dollardenominated borrowings into fixed rate eurodenominated borrowings the swaps are intended to reduce uncertainty in cash flows in us dollars and euros in connection with intercompany financing arrangements the cross currency swaps were also executed with banks we believe are creditworthy wells fargo bank na bank of america na and mufg bank ltd mufg as of december 31 2020 

the fair value of our cross currency swaps was a liability of 56 million the values of these contracts are subject to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in total we had 87 16 excluding the cash flow hedges that matured in january 2021 of our variable rate debt under our credit facilities at fixed rates at december 31 2020 compared to 59 at december 31 2019 see note 10 longterm obligations and note 11 derivative instruments and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

at december 31 2020 we had approximately 128 million of variable rate debt that was not hedged using sensitivity analysis a 100 basis point movement in interest rates would change interest expense by 1 million over the next twelve months 

commodity prices 

we are exposed to market risk related to price fluctuations in scrap metal and other metals including precious metals such as platinum palladium and rhodium market prices of these metals affect the amount that we pay for our inventory and the revenue that we generate from sales of these metals as both our revenue and costs are affected by the price fluctuations we have a natural hedge against the changes however there is typically a lag between the effect on our revenue from metal price fluctuations and inventory cost changes and there is no guarantee that the vehicle costs will decrease or increase at the same rate as the metals prices therefore we can experience positive or negative gross margin effects in periods of rising or falling metals prices particularly when such prices move rapidly additionally if market prices were to change at a greater rate than our vehicle acquisition costs we could experience a positive or negative effect on our operating margin the average of scrap metal prices for 2020 was relatively flat compared to the average for 2019

 item 1   business 

overview 

lkq corporation lkq or the company is a global distributor of vehicle products including replacement parts components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty products and accessories to improve the performance functionality and appearance of vehicles 

buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers oems new products produced by companies other than the oems which are referred to as aftermarket products recycled products obtained from salvage and total loss vehicles recycled products that have been refurbished and recycled products that have been remanufactured we distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops including aftermarket collision and mechanical products recycled collision and mechanical products refurbished collision products such as wheels bumper covers and lights and remanufactured engines and transmissions collectively we refer to the four sources that are not new oem products as alternative parts 

we are a leading provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products with our sales processing and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the united states and canada we are also a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement and maintenance products in the united kingdom germany the benelux region belgium netherlands and luxembourg italy czech republic poland slovakia austria and various other european countries in addition to our wholesale operations we operate self service retail facilities across the us that sell recycled automotive products from endoflife vehicles we are also a leading distributor of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories reaching most major markets in the us and canada 

we are organized into four operating segments wholesale  north america europe specialty and self service we aggregate our wholesale  north america and self service operating segments into one reportable segment north america resulting in three reportable segments north america europe and specialty see note 16 segment and geographic information  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for financial information by reportable segment and by geographic region 

history 

we were initially formed in 1998 through the combination of a number of wholesale recycled products businesses and subsequently expanded through internal development and acquisitions of aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured product suppliers and manufacturers self service retail businesses and specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories suppliers we have completed approximately 280 business acquisitions our most significant acquisitions include 

 further information regarding our recent acquisitions is included in note 2 business combinations to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

strategy 

our mission is to be the leading global valueadded distributor of vehicle parts and accessories by offering our customers the most comprehensive available and costeffective selection of part solutions while building strong partnerships with our employees and the communities in which we operate 

we have four primary strategic pillars to build economic value growth through diversified product offerings growth through geographic expansion adaptation to evolving technology and rationalization of our asset base to enhance margins and return on capital we believe our supply network with a broad inventory of quality alternative collision and mechanical repair products and specialty vehicle aftermarket products high fulfillment rates and superior customer service provides us with a competitive advantage to execute our strategy we are focused on a number of key areas including 

 north america segment 

our north america segment is composed of wholesale operations which consists of aftermarket and salvage operations and self service retail operations during 2019 we acquired two diagnostic and repair services businesses 

wholesale operations 

inventory 

our wholesale operations in north america sell five product types aftermarket oem recycled oem remanufactured oem refurbished and to a lesser extent new oem parts to professional collision and mechanical automobile 

repair businesses our principal aftermarket product types consist of those most frequently damaged in collisions including bumper covers automotive body panels lights and automotive glass products such as windshields platinum plus is our exclusive product line offered under the keystone brand of aftermarket products certain of our products are certified by an independent organization the certified automotive parts association “capa” capa is an association that evaluates the quality of aftermarket collision replacement products compared to oem collision replacement products we also developed a product line called value line for more value conscious often selfpay consumers our salvage products include both mechanical and collision parts including engines transmissions door assemblies sheet metal products such as trunk lids fenders and hoods lights and bumper assemblies 

the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from independent manufacturers and distributors located primarily in north america and asia principally taiwan in 2019 approximately 38 of our aftermarket purchases were made from our top 4 vendors with our largest vendor providing approximately 16 of our annual inventory purchases we believe we are one of the largest customers of each of these suppliers outside of this group no other supplier provided more than 5 of our supply of aftermarket products in 2019 we purchased approximately 49 of our aftermarket products in 2019 directly from manufacturers in taiwan and other asian countries approximately 48 of our aftermarket products were purchased from vendors located in the us however we believe the majority of these products were manufactured in taiwan mexico or other foreign countries 

within our wholesale operations we focus our procurement on products that are in the most demand based on a number of factors such as historical sales records of vehicles by model and year customer requests and projections of future supply and demand trends because lead times may be 40 days or more on imported aftermarket products sales volumes and instock inventory are important factors in the procurement process 

we procure recycled products for our wholesale operations by acquiring total loss vehicles typically sold at regional salvage auctions and then dismantling and inventorying the parts the availability and pricing of the salvage vehicles we procure for our wholesale recycled products operations may be impacted by a variety of factors including the production level of new vehicles and the percentage of damaged vehicles declared total losses our bidding specialists are equipped with a proprietary software application that allows them to compare the vehicles at salvage auctions against our current inventory levels historical demand and recent average selling prices to arrive at an estimated maximum bid 

information technology systems 

in our aftermarket operations we use a third party enterprise management system and other third party software packages to leverage the centralized data and information that a single system provides such as a data warehouse to conduct enhanced analytics and reporting an integrated budgeting system an electronic data interchange tool and ecommerce tools to enhance our online businesstobusiness initiatives  orderkeystonecom and keyless 

our wholesale recycled product locations in north america operate an internallydeveloped proprietary enterprise management system called lkqx we believe that the use of a single system across all of our wholesale recycled product operations helps facilitate the sales process allows for continued implementation of standard operating procedures and improves training efficiency employee transferability access to our national inventory database management reporting and data storage the system also supports an electronic exchange process for identifying and locating parts at other select recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock 

scrap and other materials 

our salvage operations generate scrap metal and other materials that we sell to metals recyclers vehicles that have been dismantled for recycled products and crush only endoflife vehicles acquired from other companies are typically crushed using equipment on site in other cases we will hire mobile crushing equipment to crush the vehicles before they are transported to shredders and scrap metal processors damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products including wheels we also extract and sell the precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts such as catalytic converters 

customers 

we sell our products to wholesale customers that include collision and mechanical repair shops and new and used car dealerships as well as to retail customers the majority of these customers tend to be individuallyowned small businesses although the number of independent and dealeroperated collision repair facilities has declined over the last decade as regional or national multiplelocation operators have increased their geographic presence through consolidation 

automobile insurance companies affect the demand for our collision products while insurance companies do not pay for our products directly they ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount as a result insurance companies often influence the types of products used in a repair the use of our alternative products instead of new oem products provides a direct benefit to insurance companies by lowering the cost of repairs by often decreasing the 

time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and by providing a replacement product that is of high quality and comparable performance to the part replaced 

our sales personnel are encouraged to promote lkq to customers as a “onestop shop” by offering comparable options from our other product lines if the desired part is not in stock to support these efforts we have provided our sales staff with access to both recycled and aftermarket sales systems to encourage cross selling 

to better serve our customers we take a consolidated approach to the electronic sale of wholesale products in our north america segment a full suite of ecommerce services is available to approved partners that helps us improve order accuracy reduce return rate and better fit our customer workflow using these services in coordination with our partners products can be searched priced and ordered without leaving the customers own operating systems 

distribution 

we have a distribution network of warehouses and cross dock facilities which allows us to develop and maintain our service levels with local repair shops while providing fulfillment rates that are made possible by our nationwide presence our delivery fleet utilizes a third party software provider to optimize delivery routes and to track the progress of delivery vehicles throughout their runs this third party software connects into each of our wholesale systems to allow a single interface for our management team to have a single delivery to our customer regardless of the product line or operating system our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries as required by our customers using drivers who routinely deliver to the same customers our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network we operate a delivery fleet of mediumsized trucks and smaller trucks and vans which deliver multiple product types on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs and improve customer service 

competition 

we consider all suppliers of vehicle collision and mechanical products to be competitors including aftermarket suppliers recycling businesses refurbishing operations parts remanufacturers oems and internetbased suppliers we compete with alternative parts distributors on the basis of our nationwide distribution system our product lines and inventory availability customer service our relationships with insurance companies and to a lesser extent price we compete with oems primarily on the basis of price and to a lesser extent on service and product quality we do not consider retail chains that focus on the doityourself market to be our direct competitors since many of our wholesale product sales are influenced by insurance companies who ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount rather than the end user and there is limited overlap in the products that we sell 

self service operations 

our self service retail operations most of which operate under the name “lkq pick your part” allow consumers to come directly to the yard to pick parts off of salvage vehicles in addition to revenue from the sale of parts core and scrap we charge a nominal admission fee to access the property 

inventory 

we acquire inventory for our self service retail product operations from a variety of sources including but not limited to towing companies vehicle auctions the general public municipality sales insurance carriers and charitable organizations we procure salvage vehicles for our self service retail product operations that are generally older and priced lower than the salvage vehicles we purchase for our wholesale recycled product operations vehicles are delivered to our locations by the seller or we arrange for transportation once on our property minimal labor is required to process the vehicle other than removing the battery fluids refrigerants catalytic converters and hazardous materials the extracted fluids are stored in bulk and subsequently sold to recyclers vehicles are then placed in the yard for customers to remove parts in our self service business availability of a specific part will depend on which vehicles are currently at the site and to what extent parts may have been previously sold we usually keep a vehicle at our facility for 30 to 120 days depending on the capacity of the yard and size of the market before it is crushed and sold to scrap metal processors 

scrap and other materials 

our self service operations generate scrap metal alloys and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that we no longer make available to the public and crush only vehicles acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products including wheels we also extract and sell the precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts such as catalytic converters 

customers 

the customers of our self service yards are frequently doityourself mechanics small independent repair shops servicing older vehicles auto rebuilders and resellers the scrap from the vehicle hulks when not processed by us is sold to metals recyclers with whom we may also compete when procuring salvage vehicles for our operations 

competition 

there are competitors operating self service businesses in all of the markets in which we operate in some markets there are numerous competitors often operating in close proximity to our operations we try to differentiate our business by the quality of the inventory and the size and cleanliness of the property we also differentiate our business from our competitors through our app which allows customers to receive daily push notifications when cars they are interested in are placed into their favorite yards in addition to allowing customers to see our available inventory the app also allows customers to input search parameters such as the specific part they are searching for and the year make and model of the vehicle to identify the population of cars that might be available to pull compatible parts from we do not consider retail chains that focus on the doityourself market to be our direct competitors as there is limited overlap in the products that we sell 

europe segment 

our europe segment was built on four key acquisitions ecp 2011 sator 2013 rhiag 2016 and stahlgruber 2018 additionally in 2014 we expanded our european segment to include wholesale recycling operations through our acquisition of a business with salvage and vehicle repair facilities in sweden and norway and in 2016 we acquired an equity investment in mekonomen ab mekonomen the leading independent car parts distributor in the nordic region of europe mekonomen is independent of our existing european operations but we have identified areas where the companies can work together in a mutually beneficial manner primarily related to procurement our european strategy is to target platform acquisitions to cover broad markets initially then integrate these businesses with our other operations and subsequently expand our footprint in these regions through new branch openings and smaller tuckin acquisitions our acquisitions provide a platform to capitalize on the large and fragmented aftermarket mechanical replacement parts market in europe and allow for cost savings from the leveraging of our combined purchasing power given the significant overlap in suppliers and product mix we have acquired many smaller businesses within the regions we operate and we are integrating our european operations as we optimize purchasing warehousing systems logistics and backoffice functions and align our private label brands across the segment 

in september 2019 we announced a multiyear program called 1 lkq europe to further centralize and standardize certain key functions to improve the efficiencies within the europe segment under the 1 lkq europe program we will reorganize our noncustomerfacing teams and support systems through various projects including the implementation of a common erp platform rationalization of our product portfolio and the creation of a europe headquarters office in zug switzerland 

inventory 

our inventory is primarily composed of mechanical aftermarket parts for the repair of vehicles 3 to 15 years old our top selling products include brake pads discs and sensors clutches electrical products such as spark plugs and batteries steering and suspension products filters and oil and automotive fluids in addition to mechanical aftermarket parts we also sell collision parts in our europe segment although these sales represent approximately 1 of total europe segment revenue 

in 2019 our top two suppliers represented 12 of our aftermarket inventory purchases with our top supplier representing approximately 7 of our purchases no other suppliers comprised more than 5 of our purchases during 2019 in 2019 we purchased 94 of our products from companies in europe the remaining 6 of our 2019 purchases were sourced from vendors located primarily in china or taiwan some of which also supply collision parts for our wholesale  north america operations in 2019 72 and 18 of our total inventory purchases were made in euros and pounds sterling respectively 

in our nordic operations we purchase severely damaged or totaled vehicles from insurance companies which are transferred to our dismantling facilities or sold to other third party dismantlers 

information technology systems 

our aftermarket operations in europe use various information technology “it” systems our systems are complex and are designed to perform a variety of tasks depending on the market including manage customer orders and inventory movement optimize our warehouse and logistics and financial reporting certain of our it systems can interface with our repair shop customers respective it systems which enables customers to identify and order the part required for the repair as part of our 1 lkq europe strategy to create an integrated european company we initiated a multiyear program to develop and 

implement a european wide erp system which will reduce the number of it systems we operate a pilot for our erp system was successfully deployed in the operating unit in switzerland in the first quarter of 2020 

customers 

we primarily operate a twostep ie direct sales to repair shop customers distribution model in europe although certain of our operations such as italy the netherlands germany switzerland and hungary operate partially a threestep ie sales to distributors who in turn sell to repair shop customers distribution model in our twostep operations we sell the majority of our products to commercial customers primarily consisting of professional repairers including both independent mechanical repair shops and collision repair shops in our threestep operations we sell products to wholesale distributors or jobbers in addition to our sales to repair shops and wholesale distributors we generate a portion of our revenue through sales to retail customers from ecommerce platforms and from counter sales at the branch locations 

distribution 

our european operations employ a distribution model in which inventory is stored at national or international distribution centers or regional hubs with fast moving product stored at branch locations the large distribution centers regularly restock the smaller branches and hubs and hold slower moving items helping us to improve fulfillment rates product is moved through the distribution network on our trucks vans or via common carrier 

competition 

we view all suppliers of replacement repair products as our competitors including other alternative parts suppliers and oems and their dealer networks we face significant competition in many markets where even smaller competitors can compete on price and service and the oems compete via ties to and brand loyalty of the consumer while also remaining competitive on price service and availability we believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other alternative parts suppliers primarily through our distribution network efficient stock management systems and proprietary technology which allows us to deliver our products quickly as well as through our product lines and inventory availability pricing and service 

specialty segment 

our specialty operating segment was formed in 2014 with our acquisition of keystone specialty a leading distributor and marketer of specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories in north america our specialty operations reach most major markets in the us and canada and serve the following six product segments rv truck and offroad towing speed and performance wheels tires and performance handling and miscellaneous accessories in 2017 we acquired warn industries inc warn a leading designer manufacturer and marketer of high performance vehicle equipment and accessories the acquisition of warn expanded our presence in the specialty market and created viable points of entry into related markets 

inventory   

the specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories we distribute and raw materials for products we manufacture are purchased from suppliers located primarily in the us canada and china our top selling products are rv appliances  air conditioners towing hitches truck bed covers vehicle protection products cargo management products and wheels tires  suspension products specialty aftermarket suppliers are typically small to mediumsized independent businesses that focus on a narrow product or market niche due to the highly fragmented supplier base for specialty vehicle aftermarket products we have limited supplier concentration in 2019 approximately 15 of our specialty vehicle aftermarket purchases were made from our top two suppliers with our largest supplier providing approximately 10 of our annual inventory purchases no other suppliers comprised more than 5 of our purchases during 2019 with our 2017 acquisition of warn we have internal manufacturing capabilities to source aftermarket winches hoists and bumpers 

most of our specialty operations utilize an internally developed inventory management and order entry system that interfaces with third party software systems for accounting transaction processing data analytics and reporting 

customers 

overall the specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and accessories market serves a fragmented customer base composed of rv and specialty automotive dealers installers jobbers builders parts chains and mailorder businesses our customers are principally small independent businesses these customers depend on us to provide a broad range of products rapid delivery marketing support and technical assistance in addition to traditional customers in recent years we have increased sales to several large parts and accessory online retailers our specialty segment also operates retail stores in northeast pennsylvania 

we promote our products to customers through marketing programs which include i catalogs advertising sponsorships and promotional activities ii product level marketing and merchandising support and iii online and digital 

marketing initiatives our national footprint allows us to stage trade shows across the us which provide an opportunity to improve sales through the showcasing of new and innovative products from our vendors to our customers 

online sales of our specialty products take place primarily through our ekeystonecom and viantpcom sites and mobile app these sites provide customers i the ability to match products with the make and model of vehicle thus allowing the customer to order the correct part ii product information eg pictures attributes available for review and iii the convenience of searching inventory availability and ordering the product on the site additionally the site can provide sales opportunities by suggesting other parts to purchase based on an inquiry submitted by the customer 

distribution 

our specialty segment operations employ a hubandspoke distribution model which enables us to transport products from our primary distribution centers to our noninventory stocking cross docks a majority of which are colocated with our north america wholesale operations and provide distribution points to key regional markets and synergies with our existing infrastructure we believe this provides added value to our customers through a broader product offering and more efficient distribution process we use our delivery routes to provide delivery and returns of our products directly to and from our customers in all 48 continental us states and 9 canadian provinces and we ship globally to customers in other countries our delivery fleet utilizes a third party software provider to optimize delivery routes and to track the progress of delivery vehicles throughout their runs 

competition 

industry participants have a variety of supply choices vendors can deliver products to market via warehouse distributors and mail order catalog businesses or directly to retailers andor consumers we view all suppliers of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories as our competitors we believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and equipment suppliers primarily through our broad product selection which encompasses both popular and hardtofind products our national distribution network and efficient inventory management systems as well as through our service we compete on the basis of product breadth and depth rapid and dependable delivery marketing initiatives support services and price

facilities 

as of december 31 2019 our operations included approximately 1700 facilities most of which are leased of our total facilities approximately 550 facilities were located in the us and approximately 1150 facilities were located in over 25 other countries many of our locations stock multiple product types or serve more than one function 

our global headquarters are located at 500 west madison street chicago illinois 60661 

our north american headquarters in nashville tennessee performs certain centralized functions for our north american operations including accounting procurement and information systems support 

our european operations are distributed throughout europe with main offices in tamworth england in schiedam and amsterdam the netherlands in milan italy in prague czech republic and in poing germany in addition to these offices we have two national distribution centers in tamworth totaling 1000000 and 500000 square feet respectively which house inventory to supply the hubs and branches of our uk and republic of ireland operations and one international distribution center in sulzbachrosenberg germany which supplies stahlgruber’s operations in germany austria italy slovenia and croatia under the 1 lkq europe program we are establishing a europe headquarters office in zug switzerland 

our specialty operations maintain primary procurement accounting and finance functions in exeter pennsylvania 

certain backoffice support functions for our segments are performed in bangalore india additionally we operate an aftermarket parts warehouse in taiwan to aggregate inventory for shipment to our locations in north america 

regulation 

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment in the us and the other countries in which we operate see the risk factor “ we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters ” in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding the effects of environmental laws and regulations on us 

we may be affected by tariffs and other import laws and restrictions because we import into the us a significant number of products for sale and distribution see the risk factors “ if significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on products or materials we import or any related countermeasures are taken by countries to which we export products our revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed ” and “ intellectual property claims relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business ” in part 1 item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding importation risks

  we have thousands of employees located in the us and many other countries and are subject to labor and employment laws in numerous jurisdictions see the risk factor “ our business may be adversely affected by union activities and labor and employment laws ” in part 1 item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding these labor and employment risks 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related repairs our specialty vehicle operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the second quarter when vehicle owners tend to install this equipment and lower revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter when the number of rv trips tends to decline as a result of the winter weather our aftermarket glass operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the second and third quarters when the demand for automotive replacement glass increases after the winter weather 

environmental social and governance matters   

environmental 

we contribute to a healthy environment for example our north american recycling operations harvest vehicle components for reuse in the repair of vehicles once the parts are harvested the remaining valuable materials are removed and repurposed for use in the manufacturing of new basic materials such as steel aluminum plastic and rubber additionally we extract fluids that we recycle or utilize in our own operations such as gas to run our own truck fleet 

our recycling efforts are a key pillar of our mission statement of being a responsible steward of the environment and a true partner with the communities in which we operate this stewardship has been embedded in our culture since the company’s founding in 1998 our recycling efforts preserve natural resources reduce the demand for scarce landfill space and help decrease air and water pollution 

the table below highlights our north american recycling operation’s efforts in 2019 to minimize the environmental impact of total loss and endoflife vehicles with effective and proper vehicle disposition and lists the approximate number or amount of parts or other materials removed from such vehicles and sold or used by us in our operations in thousands 



social 

we continuously strive to improve the effect of our operations and the awareness of all of our employees with respect to social issues we seek diversity of our employees and do not discriminate in our employment with respect to race color ethnicity national origin ancestry citizenship status religion sex gender identity and expression age disability protected medical condition marital status veteran or military status sexual orientation pregnancy genetic information or any other characteristic protected by civil rights laws we do not tolerate harassment or retaliation against persons that report improper behavior 

we have shared with our employees some of the benefits we received as part of the tax reform act of 2017 including through a reduction of medical care premiums an increase in paid time off an increase in the company’s matching amount under our retirement plan a tuition reimbursement program and a scholarship program for the children of our employees in addition we have established a fund to help employees that experience catastrophic losses 

we also strive to improve the communities in which we operate the employees at our facilities are encouraged to volunteer in local community activities and we have established a charitable foundation to distribute funds to local causes 

governance 

we have made substantial progress in the area of corporate governance for example we have three female members on our board of directors and we have added five new members to the board since august 2018 after the departure from the board by two of our current directors at our annual meeting of stockholders in may 2020 over 80 of our directors will be independent we believe that the skill sets of our newly constituted board effectively address the areas of focus that are important for our short and longterm strategic objectives 

  we have adopted “proxy access” which permits an eligible stockholder to nominate and include in our proxy materials director nominees subject to the terms set forth in our bylaws we also have majority voting for the election of our directors requiring a director who fails to receive a majority vote to tender his or her resignation to the board 

  our board of directors recently adopted a revised code of ethics to help ensure that everyone at lkq is clear on our mission values and guiding ethical principles the code of ethics covers a variety of topics including the health and safety of our employees fair dealing with our customers suppliers and competitors antibribery rules conflict of interest prohibitions and protecting personal data 




 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

our operating results and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the economic political and social conditions in the us and elsewhere 

changes in economic political and social conditions in the us europe and other countries in which we are located or do business could have a material effect on our company negative effects to our supply chain costs of doing business sales and distribution activity may occur due to factors such as war or threats of war natural disasters nuclear facility accidents public health emergencies utility interruptions and terrorism 

our business is also affected by a number of other factors for example the number and types of new vehicles produced and sold by manufacturers affects our business a decrease in the number of vehicles on the road may result in a decrease in repairs 

our sales are also impacted by changes to the economic health of vehicle owners the economic health of vehicle owners is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit taxation fuel prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside of our control if any of these conditions worsen our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities and hedge transactions these unfavorable events affecting our business partners could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we have a substantial business presence in europe including a significant presence in the uk and the republic of ireland “roi” in june 2016 voters in the uk decided by referendum to withdraw from the european union also known as brexit the precise timing and impacts of this action on our businesses in the uk and other parts of europe are unknown at this time since the vote we have seen fluctuations in exchange rates leading to cost pressures and unfavorable translation effects on our sterling denominated earnings the uk’s withdrawal from the european union became effective on january 31 2020 the uk and the european union now have an 11month transition period to negotiate a trade deal and come to terms on other issues such as security and law enforcement depending upon the outcome of these negotiations our european businesses could be adversely affected as a result of further fluctuations in exchange rates disruptions to access to markets by uk and roi companies interruptions of the movement of goods and services between countries a decrease of economic activity in europe and political or social unrest 

we face intense competition from local national international and internetbased vehicle products providers and this competition could negatively affect our business 

the vehicle replacement products industry and vehicle accessory parts industry are highly competitive and are served by numerous suppliers of oem recycled aftermarket refurbished and remanufactured products within each of these categories of suppliers there are local owneroperated companies larger regional suppliers national and international providers and internetbased suppliers and distributors providers of vehicle replacement and accessory products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of vehicle products which may further increase competition some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise greater financial technical manufacturing distribution and other resources longer operating histories lower cost structures and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries or with consumers than we do business transacted on online marketplaces has been increasing which presents additional competitive pressures on us in addition facilitators of these online marketplaces control access to this channel and may prohibit us from participating for various reasons 

in the us and europe local companies have formed cooperative efforts in an attempt to more efficiently compete against us in all aspects of our business as a result of these factors our competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply provide their products at lower costs or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve 

we believe that a majority of collision parts by dollar amount are supplied by oems with the balance being supplied by distributors of alternative aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured collision parts like us the oems are therefore able to exert pricing pressure in the marketplace we compete with the oems primarily on price and to a lesser extent on service and quality from time to time the oems have implemented programs seeking to increase their market share in the collision repair parts industry for example they have reduced prices on specific products to match the lower prices of 

alternative products and introduced other rebate programs that may disrupt our sales the growth of these programs or the introduction of new ones could have a material adverse impact on our business 

in addition vehicles are being equipped with systems that transmit data to the oems wirelessly regarding among other items accident incidents maintenance requirements location of the vehicle identification of the closest dealership and other statistics about the vehicle and its driving history to the extent that this data is not shared with alternative suppliers the oems will have an advantage with respect to such matters as contacting the vehicle driver recommending repairs and maintenance and directing the vehicle owner to an affiliated dealership 

we rely upon our customers and insurance companies to promote the usage of alternative parts 

our success depends in part on the acceptance and promotion of alternative parts usage by automotive insurance companies and vehicle repair facilities there can be no assurance that current levels of alternative parts usage will be maintained or will increase in the future 

we rely on business relationships with insurance companies these insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide the business relationships include in some cases participation in aftermarket quality and service assurance programs that may result in a higher usage of our aftermarket products than would be the case without the programs our arrangements with these companies may be terminated by them at any time including in connection with their own business concerns relating to the offering availability standards or operations of the aftermarket quality and service assurance programs we rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in an illinois lawsuit involving state farm mutual automobile insurance company avery v state farm a jury decided in october 1999 that state farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using nonoem replacement products to repair damaged vehicles when use of such products did not restore the vehicle to its preloss condition the jury found that state farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of nonoem replacement products and the alleged inferiority of those products damages in excess of 1 billion were assessed against state farm in august 2005 the illinois supreme court reversed the awards made by the lower courts and found among other things that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any breach of contract by state farm the plaintiffs filed a subsequent claim alleging that state farm improperly influenced one of the justices on the illinois supreme court prior to trial on the subsequent claim the parties settled the case as part of the settlement state farm paid the plaintiffs 250 million as a result of this case some insurance companies reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket products our financial results could be adversely affected if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled products from us due to a fear of similar claims 

in addition to the extent that the collision repair industry continues to consolidate the buying power of collision repair shop customers may further increase putting additional pressure on our financial returns 

we may not be able to successfully acquire new businesses or integrate acquisitions and we may not be able to successfully divest certain businesses 

we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms if we do not obtain required antitrust or other regulatory approvals or for other reasons moreover we may not be able to identify acquisition candidates at reasonable prices andor be able to successfully integrate acquisitions 

if we buy a company or a division of a company we may experience difficulty integrating that companys or divisions personnel and operations which could negatively affect our operating results in addition 



 for example we have undertaken the 1 lkq europe program to create structural centralization and standardization of key functions to facilitate the operation of the europe segment as a single business this program will present a number of execution challenges 

in addition to acquisitions we have divested and will continue to divest certain businesses that do not meet our performance standards as a result of a divestment we may not recover the carrying value of our investment in the divested business in addition such divestment transactions require significant management time and attention 

intellectual property claims relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business  

oems and others have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims oems have brought such claims in federal court and with the us international trade commission in some cases we have entered into patent license agreements with oems that allow us to sell aftermarket parts that replicate the patented parts in exchange for a royalty and otherwise in accordance with the terms of the agreements 

to the extent oems and other manufacturers obtain design patents or trademarks and are successful in asserting claims of infringement of these patents or trademarks against us we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business in the event that our license agreements or other similar license arrangements with oems or others are terminated or we are unable to agree upon renewal terms we may be subject to costs and uncertainties of litigation as well as restrictions on our ability to sell aftermarket parts that replicate parts covered by those design patents or trademarks we have filed and may file in the future challenges to oem patents including patents owned by oems with which we have patent license agreements we also may file challenges to oem trademarks to the extent oems are successful in defending their patents or trademarks we could be restricted or prohibited from selling the corresponding aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business also we will likely incur expenses investigating pursuing and defending intellectual property claims 

us customs and border protection has taken the position that certain of our aftermarket parts infringe certain oem trademarks and seized our aftermarket parts as we attempted to import them into the us we incur costs and expenses attempting to convince customs and border protection to release the seized goods and in litigation where we are seeking a determination of noninfringement in the event we are unsuccessful in obtaining their release such goods may be subject to forfeiture and other penalties 

aftermarket products certifying organizations may revoke the certification of parts that are the subject of the intellectual property disputes lack of certification may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of aftermarket products only if they have been certified by an independent certifying organization 

if the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines or the number of cars being repaired declines or the mix of the types of vehicles in the overall vehicle population changes our business could suffer 

our business depends on vehicle accidents mechanical failures and routine maintenance for both the demand for repairs using our products and the supply of recycled remanufactured and refurbished parts to the extent that a relatively higher percentage of damaged vehicles are declared total losses there will be less demand for our products to repair such vehicles in addition our business is impacted by factors that influence the number andor severity of accidents and mechanical failures including but not limited to the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven the ages of drivers the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions the congestion of traffic drivers distracted by electronic equipment the use of alcohol or drugs by drivers the usage rate and effectiveness of accident avoidance systems in new vehicles the reliability of new oem parts and the condition of roadways for example an increase in the acceptance of ridesharing could reduce the number of vehicles on the road additionally an increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the need for mechanical repairs and maintenance to decline as motorists seek alternative transportation options mild weather conditions particularly during winter months tend to result in a decrease in vehicle accidents moreover legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones or other electronic devices while driving could lead to a decline in accidents 

systems designed to minimize accident frequency and severity are becoming more prevalent and more technologically sophisticated to the extent oems install or are mandated by law to install accident avoidance systems in their vehicles the number and severity of accidents could decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the average number of new vehicles sold annually has fluctuated from yeartoyear periods of decreased sales could result in a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road and consequently fewer vehicles involved in accidents or in need of mechanical repair or maintenance substantial further declines in automotive sales in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition in addition if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of older vehicles on the road insurance companies may find it uneconomical to repair such vehicles or there could be less costly repairs if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of newer vehicles on the road the demand generally for mechanical repairs and maintenance would likely decline due to the newer longerlasting parts in the vehicle population and mechanical failures being covered by oem warranties for the first years of a vehicles life moreover alternative collision and mechanical parts are less likely to be used on newer vehicles our specialty segment depends on sales of pickup trucks sport utility vehicles crossover utility vehicles high performance vehicles and recreational vehicles any reduction in the number of such vehicles in operation will adversely affect demand for our specialty products 

electric vehicles do not have traditional engines transmissions and certain related parts engines and transmissions represent some of our largest revenue generating skus in north america and parts for engines and transmissions represent a significant amount of the revenue of our european operations thus an increase in electric vehicles as a percentage of vehicles sold will have a negative impact on our sales of engines transmissions and other related parts 

fluctuations in the prices of metals and other commodities could adversely affect our financial results 

our recycling operations generate scrap metal and other metals that we sell after we dismantle a salvage vehicle for wholesale parts and after vehicles have been processed in our self service retail business the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors and other remaining metals are sold to processors and brokers of metals in addition we receive crush only vehicles from other companies including oems which we dismantle and which generate scrap metal and other metals the prices of scrap and other metals have historically fluctuated sometimes significantly due to market factors in addition buyers may stop purchasing metals entirely due to excess supply to the extent that the prices of metals decrease materially or buyers stop purchasing metals our revenue from such sales will suffer and a writedown of our inventory value could be required for example in 2018 china imposed a ban on the importation of various types of solid waste allegedly in an effort to reduce environmental pollution this ban includes certain metals that we sell and continues to have the effect of reducing the prices of such products 

the cost of our wholesale recycled and our self service retail inventory purchases will change as a result of fluctuating scrap metal and other metals prices in a period of falling metal prices there can be no assurance that our inventory purchasing cost will decrease the same amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal and other metals prices decline and there may be a delay between the scrap metal and other metals price reductions and any inventory cost reductions the prices of steel aluminum and plastics are components of the cost to manufacture products for our aftermarket business if the prices of commodities rise and result in higher costs to us for products we sell we may not be able to pass these higher costs on to our customers 

existing or new laws and regulations or changes to enforcement or interpretation of existing laws or regulations may prohibit restrict or burden the sale of aftermarket recycled refurbished or remanufactured products  

most states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair work these laws include requirements relating to consumer disclosure vehicle owner’s consent regarding the use of aftermarket products in the repair process and the requirement to have aftermarket products certified by an independent testing organization additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future if additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business 

certain organizations test the quality and safety of vehicle replacement products if these organizations decide not to test a particular vehicle product or in the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product such events could adversely affect our business 

some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags in addition laws relating to the regulation of parts affecting vehicle emissions such as california’s proposition 65 may impact the ability of our specialty segment to sell certain accessory products these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled products the passage of legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on our business additionally congress could enact federal legislation restricting the use of aftermarket or recycled automotive products used in the course of vehicle repairs 

the federal trade commission has issued guides that regulate the use of certain terms such as “rebuilt” or “remanufactured” in connection with the sale of automotive parts restrictions on the products we are able to sell and on the marketing of such products could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any covered major part the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on vehicle recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may discourage the use by such shops of recycled products there is no pending initiative to implement the parts registration from a law enforcement point of view however there is a risk that a heightened legislative concern over safety of parts might precipitate an effort to push for the implementation of such rules 

an adverse change in our relationships with our suppliers or a disruption to our supply of inventory could increase our expenses and impede our ability to serve our customers 

our north american business is dependent on a relatively small number of suppliers of aftermarket products a large portion of which are sourced from taiwan our european business also acquires product from asian sources we incur substantial freight costs to import parts from our suppliers many of which are located in asia if the cost of freight rose we might not be able to pass the cost increases on to our customers furthermore although alternative suppliers exist for substantially all aftermarket products distributed by us the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on us until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced manufacturing and providing the relevant products in addition we are subject to disruptions from work stoppages and other labor disputes at port facilities through which we import our inventory we also face the risk that our suppliers could attempt to circumvent us and sell their product directly to our customers consolidation of our suppliers could enhance their ability to distribute products through additional sales channels and thus decrease their reliance on wholesale distributors like us 

moreover our operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad including among other things natural disasters transportation costs and delays political instability currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs import and export controls and other nontariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas as well as the uncertainty regarding future relations between china japan and taiwan for example us customs and border protection have used claims of intellectual property infringement to seize certain of our aftermarket parts as we attempted to import them into the us 

because a substantial volume of our sales involves products manufactured from sheet metal we can be adversely impacted if sheet metal becomes unavailable or is only available at higher prices which we may not be able to pass on to our customers additionally as oems convert to raw materials other than steel it may be more difficult or expensive to source aftermarket parts made with such materials and it may be more difficult for repair shops to work with such materials in the repair process 

most of our salvage and a portion of our self service inventory is obtained from vehicles offered at salvage auctions operated by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the us we do not typically have contracts with the auction companies according to industry analysts a small number of companies control a large percentage of the salvage auction market in the us if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions began competing with us or significantly raised its fees our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers moreover we face competition in the purchase of vehicles from direct competitors rebuilders exporters and other bidders to the extent that the number of bidders increases it may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold for wholesale recycled products some states regulate bidders to help ensure that salvage vehicles are purchased for legal purposes by qualified buyers auction companies have been actively seeking to reduce circumvent or eliminate these regulations which would further increase the number of bidders 

in addition there is a limited supply of salvage vehicles in the us and thus the costs to us of these vehicles could increase over time in some states when a vehicle is deemed a total loss a salvage title is issued whether states issue salvage titles is important to the supply of inventory for the vehicle recycling industry because an increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles currently these titling issues are a matter of state law in 1992 the us congress commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle titling registration and salvage since then legislation has been introduced seeking to establish national uniform requirements in this area including a uniform definition of a salvage vehicle the vehicle recycling industry will generally favor a uniform 

definition since it will avoid inconsistencies across state lines and will generally favor a definition that expands the number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage however certain interest groups including repair shops and some insurance associations may oppose this type of legislation national legislation has not yet been enacted in this area and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in the future 

we also acquire inventory directly from insurance companies oems and others to the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue these arrangements our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers 

in europe we acquire products from a wide variety of suppliers as vehicle technology changes some parts will become more complex and the design or technology of those parts may be covered by patents or other rights that make it difficult for aftermarket suppliers to produce for sale to companies such as ours the complexity of the parts may include software or other technical aspects that make it difficult to identify what is wrong with the vehicle more complex parts may be difficult to repair and may require expensive or difficult to obtain software updates limiting our ability to compete with the oems 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control future factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to those listed in the special note on forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k additionally the number of selling days can fluctuate each quarter causing volatility in revenue and net income accordingly our results of operations may not be indicative of future performance these fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below our published financial guidance and the expectations of public markets which could cause our stock price or the value of our debt instruments to decline 

our key management personnel are important to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives if we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel which could harm our business in addition to the extent wage inflation occurs in jurisdictions in which we operate we may not be able to retain key employees or we may experience increased costs 

we operate in foreign jurisdictions which exposes us to foreign exchange and other risks 

we have operations in north america europe and taiwan and we may expand our operations in the countries in which we do business and into other countries our foreign operations expose us to additional risks associated with international business which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition including import and export requirements and compliance with anticorruption laws such as the uk bribery act 2010 and the foreign corrupt practices act we also incur costs in currencies other than our functional currencies in some of the countries in which we operate we are thus subject to foreign exchange exposure to the extent that we operate in different currencies as well as exposure to foreign tax and other foreign and domestic laws in addition certain countries in which we operate have a higher level of political instability and criminal activity than the us that could affect our operations and the ability to maintain our supply of products 

if we determine that our goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired we may incur significant charges to our pretax income 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations in the future our goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of acquisitions goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses deterioration of expected future cash flows or performance increases in our cost of capital adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including modifications that restrict the activities of the acquired business as of december 31 2019  our total goodwill subject to future impairment testing was 44 billion for further discussion of our annual impairment test see goodwill impairment in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of item 7 in this annual report on form 10k 

except for indefinitelived intangibles we amortize other intangible assets over the assigned useful lives each of which is based upon the expected period to be benefited we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we review finitelived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not 

be recoverable in the event conditions change that affect our ability to realize the underlying cash flows associated with our intangible assets we may record an impairment charge as of december 31 2019  the value of our other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization was 850 million 

our business may be adversely affected by union activities and labor and employment laws  

certain of our employees are represented by labor unions and other employee representative bodies and work under collective bargaining or similar agreements which are subject to periodic renegotiation from time to time there have been efforts to organize additional portions of our workforce and those efforts can be expected to continue in addition legislators and government agencies could adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that could make it significantly easier for unionization efforts to be successful also we may in the future be subject to strikes or work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disruptions and disputes additional unionization efforts new collective bargaining or similar agreements and work stoppages could materially increase our costs and reduce revenue and could limit our flexibility in terms of work schedules reductions in force and other operational matters 

we also are subject to laws and regulations that govern such matters as minimum wage overtime and other working conditions some of these laws are technical in nature and could be subject to interpretation by government agencies and courts different than our interpretations efforts to comply with existing laws changes to such laws and newlyenacted laws may increase our labor costs and limit our flexibility if we were found not to be in compliance with such laws we could be subject to fines penalties and liabilities to our employees or government agencies in addition efforts to better protect local markets from foreign workers and decisions of countries to withdraw from treaties and joint economic areas may lead to increased restrictions on the free movement of people and labor and may limit our ability to place key personnel where they could best serve our needs 

we rely on information technology and communication systems in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business 

in the ordinary course of business we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are leased from third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans our information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals breaches due to employee error or malfeasance disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware terminations of business relationships by third party service providers power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures terrorist acts natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation any of which could adversely affect our business in addition as security threats continue to evolve we will likely need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems 

in the event that we decide to switch providers or to implement upgrades or replacements to our own systems we may be unsuccessful in the development of our own systems or we may underestimate the costs and expenses of switching providers or developing and implementing our own systems also our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system which period could extend longer than we anticipated we are in the midst of a systems conversion project for our european businesses which will be subject to all of these risks 

the costs of complying with the requirements of laws pertaining to the privacy and security of personal information and the potential liability associated with the failure to comply with such laws could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations  

we collect personally identifiable information pii and other data as part of our business processes and operations the legislative and regulatory framework relating to privacy and data protection is rapidly evolving worldwide and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future this data is subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations many foreign countries and governmental bodies including the european union canada and other jurisdictions where we conduct business have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of pii and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions that are more restrictive than those in the us additionally the european union adopted the general data protection regulation gdpr that will impose more stringent data protection requirements for processors and controllers of personal data including expanded disclosures about how pii is to be used limitations on retention of pii mandatory data breach notification requirements and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities the gdpr became effective in may 2018 and there can be no assurance that we have timely implemented all processes required for full compliance with the regulation the gdpr provides severe penalties for noncompliance in addition stricter laws in this area are being enacted in certain states in the us and in other countries and more jurisdictions are likely to follow this trend 

any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection issues even if unfounded or comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations including at newlyacquired companies could result in additional cost and liability to us result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions give rise to civil litigation result in damage to our reputation including the loss of trust by our customers and employees inhibit sales and otherwise adversely affect our business we also may be subject to these adverse effects if other parties with whom we do business including lenders suppliers consultants and advisors violate applicable laws or contractual obligations or suffer a security breach 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our operations the function of our computer systems andor the availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in the closure of our distribution centers or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory through our system on a timely basis this may affect our ability to serve our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the us or into the other countries in which we operate and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters  

we are subject to various environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators or lose our operating permits we could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials we have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements we cannot assure you however that we will at all times be in complete compliance with such requirements 

we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future 

under certain environmental laws we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at or migration to or from our or our predecessors past or present facilities and at independent waste disposal sites these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or was not responsible for the release of such hazardous substances many of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use that may have involved hazardous materials as a result some of our properties may be contaminated some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination these environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of treats or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties or successors to such owners or operators for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 

contamination resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release storage transportation or disposal of gasoline motor oil antifreeze transmission fluid chlorofluorocarbons cfcs from air conditioners other hazardous materials or metals such as aluminum cadmium chromium lead and mercury contamination from the refurbishment of chrome plated bumpers can occur from the release of the plating material contamination can migrate onsite or offsite which can increase the risk and the amount of any potential liability 

when we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process we analyze the risks and when appropriate perform further environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination furthermore where appropriate we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters in the event we discover new information or if laws change we may incur significant liabilities which may exceed our reserves 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we could be subject to product liability claims and involved in product recalls 

if customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage we could be subject to product liability claims by such customers the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we may become involved in the recall of a product that is determined to be defective more generally a recall involving alternative parts even if we did not sell the recalled products could adversely affect the perceived quality of alternative parts leading to decreased usage of alternative parts the expenses of a recall and the damage to our reputation or the reputation of alternative parts generally could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have agreed to defend and indemnify in certain circumstances insurance companies and customers against claims and damages relating to product liability and product recalls the existence of claims or damages for which we must defend and indemnify these parties could also negatively impact our business results of operations or financial condition 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits 

our operating subsidiaries in our salvage selfservice and refurbishing operations must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations when we develop or acquire a new facility we must seek the approval of state and local units of government governmental agencies may resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling or refurbishing facility in their communities there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold 

regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and otherwise adversely impact our business  

in august 2012 as mandated by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec adopted final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals originating from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries these requirements impose significant burdens on us public companies compliance with the rules requires substantial due diligence in an effort to determine whether products contain the conflict minerals the results of such due diligence efforts must be disclosed on an annual basis in a filing with the sec 

our supply chain is complex and we may incur significant costs to determine the source of any such minerals used in our products we may also incur costs with respect to potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of our diligence activities further the implementation of these rules and their effect on customer supplier andor consumer behavior could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering products free of conflict minerals in some circumstances we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary products from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflictfree or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement accordingly these rules could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition 

if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks and other vehicles our business could be harmed 

we use a fleet of trucks and other vehicles to deliver the majority of the products we sell we are subject to the risks associated with providing delivery services including inclement weather disruptions in the transportation infrastructure governmental regulation availability and price of fuel liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance and insurance premium increases in addition our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may lose the right to operate at key locations 

we lease most of the properties at which we conduct our businesses at the end of a lease term we must negotiate a renewal exercise a purchase option to the extent we have that right or find a new location there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate renewals on terms acceptable to us or that we will find a suitable alternative location especially with respect to our salvage operations which have characteristics that are often not attractive to landlords local governments or neighbors in such cases we may lose the right to operate at key locations 

our effective tax rate could materially increase as a consequence of various factors including interpretations and administrative guidance in regard to the tax act defined below us andor international tax legislation mix of earnings by jurisdiction and us and foreign jurisdictional audits 

we are a us based multinational company subject to income taxes in the us and a number of foreign jurisdictions therefore we are subject to changes in tax laws in each of these jurisdictions and such changes could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate and cash flows 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act among other things the tax act reduced the us statutory corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 additionally beginning in 2018 the tax act imposed a regime of taxation on foreign subsidiary earnings global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” and on certain related party payments base erosion antiabuse tax “beat” other important changes potentially material to our operations included the full expensing of certain assets placed into service after september 27 2017 the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction and additional limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation finally as part of the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system the tax act imposed a onetime transition tax on the deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 

many nonus jurisdictions are implementing tax legislation based upon recommendations made by the organization for economic cooperation and development in connection with its base erosion and profit shifting study as well as certain antitaxavoidance initiatives advanced by the european commission the outcome of these legislative developments could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate and cash flows 

the tax rates applicable in the jurisdictions within which we operate vary widely therefore our effective tax rate may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of our earnings by jurisdiction 

we are also subject to ongoing audits of our income tax returns in various jurisdictions both in the us and internationally while we believe that our tax positions will be sustained the outcomes of such audits could result in the assessment of additional taxes which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results 

if significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on products or materials we import or any related countermeasures are taken by countries to which we export products our revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed  

the current us administration has imposed tariffs on certain materials imported into the us from china and announced additional tariffs on other goods from china and other countries moreover countermeasures have been taken by other countries in retaliation for the usimposed tariffs the tariffs cover products and materials that we import and the countermeasures may affect products we export the effects currently are not material however depending on the breadth of products and materials ultimately affected by and the duration of the tariffs and countermeasures our financial results may be materially harmed in addition countries may impose other restrictions on the importation of products for example in 2018 china imposed a ban on the importation of various types of solid waste allegedly in an effort to reduce environmental pollution this ban includes certain scrap metals that we sell and continues to have the effect of reducing the prices of such products 

activist investors could cause us to incur substantial costs divert management’s attention and have an adverse effect on our business 

we have in the past received and we may in the future be subject to proposals by activist investors urging us to take certain corporate actions activist investor activities could cause our business to be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and other demands by activist investors can be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees for example we have retained and may in the future be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist investor matters including legal financial and communications advisors the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results campaigns by activist investors to effect changes at publiclytraded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short term investor value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company perceived uncertainties as to our future direction strategy or leadership that arise as a consequence of activist investor initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities harm our ability to attract new investors employees and business partners and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation 

risks relating to our common stock and financial structure 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline additionally the market price for our common stock has been in the past and in the future may be adversely affected by allegations made or reports issued by short sellers analysts activists or others regarding our business model our management or our financial accounting 

following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

delaware law our charter documents and our loan documents may impede or discourage a takeover which could affect the price of our stock 

the antitakeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws our loan documents and delaware law could together or separately impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult our credit agreement provides that a change of control is an event of default our incorporation under delaware law and these provisions could also impede an acquisition takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the price of our common stock 

future sales of our common stock or other securities may depress our stock price 

we and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock or other equity debt or instruments that constitute an element of our debt and equity collectively securities in the future we may also issue shares of common stock under our equity incentive plan or in connection with future acquisitions we cannot predict the size of future issuances of securities or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock or other securities will have on the price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued in connection with an acquisition the issuance of additional debt securities or the perception that such sales or issuances could occur may cause the price of our common stock to fall 

we cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented 

in october 2018 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program totaling 500 million in october 2019 our board of directors authorized an increase to our existing stock repurchase program under which the company may purchase up to an additional 500 million of our common stock bringing the authorized total to 10 billion we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares and our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to react to changes in our business 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 16 billion aggregate principal amount of secured debt outstanding and approximately 18 billion of availability under our credit agreement  19 billion of availability reduced by 69 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit in addition we had approximately 23 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured debt outstanding comprising 600 million aggregate principal amount of 475 senior notes due may 15 2023 the us notes 2023 €500 million 561 million aggregate principal amount of 3875 senior notes due april 1 2024 the euro notes 2024 and €10 billion 11 billion aggregate principal amount consisting of €750 million of 3625 senior notes due 2026 the euro notes 2026 and €250 million of 4125 senior notes due 2028 the euro notes 2028 together with the 2026 notes the euro notes 202628 and together with the us notes 2023 euro notes 2024 and euro notes 2026 the senior notes borrowings under the credit agreement mature in january 2024 on january 10 2020 we redeemed the us notes 2023 at a redemption price equal to 101583 of the principal amount of the us notes 2023 plus accrued and unpaid interest 

our significant amount of debt and our debt service obligations could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations limit our ability to operate our business and impair our competitive position 

for example our debt and our debt service obligations could 



 in addition if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the ability to service such debt would increase 

our senior notes do not impose any limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or protect against certain other types of transactions 

although we are subject to our credit agreement for so long as it remains in effect the indentures governing the senior notes do not restrict the future incurrence of unsecured indebtedness guarantees or other obligations the indentures contain certain limitations on our ability to incur liens on assets and engage in sale and leaseback transactions however these limitations are subject to important exceptions in addition the indentures do not contain many other restrictions including certain restrictions contained in our credit agreement including without limitation making investments prepaying subordinated indebtedness or engaging in transactions with our affiliates 

our credit agreement will permit subject to specified conditions and limitations the incurrence of a significant amount of additional indebtedness as of december 31 2019  we would have been able to incur an additional 18 billion of indebtedness under our credit agreement  19 billion of availability reduced by 69 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the need to service such debt would increase 

our credit agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

our credit agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability among other things to 

 as a result of these covenants and restrictions we will be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit agreement a default if not waived could result in acceleration of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing credit facilities or it may be on terms that are not acceptable to us 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and might 

be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we hope to realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due any future refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations additionally our credit agreement and the indentures that govern our senior notes limit the use of the proceeds from certain dispositions of our assets as a result our credit agreement and our senior notes may prevent us from using the proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all of our debt service obligations 

our future capital needs may require that we seek to refinance our debt or obtain additional debt or equity financing events that could have a negative effect on our business 

we may need to raise additional funds in the future to among other things refinance existing debt fund our existing operations improve or expand our operations respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions from time to time we may raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic alliances or other arrangements funds may not be available or available on terms acceptable to us as a result of different factors including but not limited to turmoil in the credit markets that results in the tightening of credit conditions and current or future regulations applicable to the financial institutions from whom we seek financing if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of our common stock if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and further limitations on our operations if we refinance or restructure our debt we may incur charges to write off the unamortized portion of deferred debt issuance costs from a previous financing or we may incur charges related to hedge ineffectiveness from our interest rate swap obligations there are restrictions in the indenture that governs the euro notes 2024 euro notes 2026 and euro notes 2028 on our ability to refinance such notes prior to january 1 2024 april 1 2021 and april 1 2023 respectively if we fail to raise capital when needed our business may be negatively affected 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly and could affect the value of our senior notes 

certain borrowings under our credit agreement and the borrowing under our accounts receivable securitization facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness would correspondingly decrease moreover changes in market interest rates could affect the trading value of the senior notes certain of our variable rate debt including our revolving credit facility currently uses the london interbank offered rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate libor is the subject of recent proposals for reform these reforms and other pressures may cause libor to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past the consequences of these developments with respect to libor cannot be entirely predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt assuming all revolving loans were fully drawn and no interest rate swaps were in place each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in a 36 million change in annual cash interest expense under our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization facility 

repayment of our indebtedness including our senior notes is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries 

we are a holding company and repayment of our senior notes will be dependent upon cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are borrowers or guarantors of the indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness including the senior notes each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries and under certain circumstances distributions from our subsidiaries may be subject to taxes that reduce the amount of such distributions available to us while the indentures governing the senior notes limit the ability of our subsidiaries to restrict the payment of dividends or to restrict other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness including the senior notes 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our senior notes 

credit ratings have an important effect on our cost of capital credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include among other items our results of operations business decisions that we make their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading we believe our current credit ratings enhance our ability to borrow funds at favorable rates a downgrade in our current credit rating from a rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed 

funds under our credit facilities a downgrade could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our senior notes preventing a holder from selling the senior notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affecting our ability to issue new notes in the future or incur other indebtedness upon favorable terms 

the right to receive payments on the senior notes is effectively junior to those lenders who have a security interest in our assets 

our obligations under our senior notes and our guarantors’ obligations under their guarantees of the senior notes are unsecured but our and each coborrower’s obligations under our credit agreement and each guarantor’s obligations under their respective guarantees of the credit agreement are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our domestic tangible and intangible assets including the stock of most of our whollyowned united states subsidiaries and the stock of certain of our nonunited states subsidiaries if we are declared bankrupt or insolvent or if we default under our credit agreement the lenders could declare all of the funds borrowed thereunder together with accrued interest immediately due and payable if we were unable to repay such indebtedness the lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets to the exclusion of holders of our senior notes even if an event of default exists under the applicable indenture governing the senior notes furthermore if the lenders foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any subsidiary guarantor under our senior notes then that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the senior notes automatically and immediately upon such sale in any such event because the senior notes are not secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in subsidiary guarantors it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from which claims by holders of the senior notes could be satisfied or if any assets remained they might be insufficient to satisfy claims fully as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 16 billion aggregate principal amount of secured debt outstanding and approximately 18 billion of availability under our credit agreement  19 billion of availability reduced by 69 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit 

united states federal and state statutes allow courts under specific circumstances to void the senior notes and the guarantees subordinate claims in respect of the senior notes and the guarantees and require holders of the senior notes to return payments received from us or the guarantors 

our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that are obligors under the credit agreement guarantee the obligations under our senior notes in addition certain subsidiaries of the issuer of the euro notes 2024 guarantee the obligations under the euro notes 2024 the issuance of our senior notes and the issuance of the guarantees by the guarantors may be subject to review under state and federal laws if a bankruptcy liquidation or reorganization case or a lawsuit including in circumstances in which bankruptcy is not involved were commenced at some future date by or on behalf of our unpaid creditors or the unpaid creditors of a guarantor under the federal bankruptcy laws of the united states and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws a court may avoid or otherwise decline to enforce the senior notes or a guarantor’s guarantee or may subordinate the senior notes or such guarantee to our or the applicable guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness while the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction a court might do so if it found that when indebtedness under the senior notes was issued or when the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee or in some jurisdictions when payments became due under the senior notes or such guarantee the issuer or the applicable guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and 

 a court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the senior notes or such guarantee if we or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the senior notes thus if the guarantees were legally challenged any guarantee could be subject to the claim that since the guarantee was incurred for our benefit and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration if a court were to void the issuance of the senior notes or any guarantee a holder of the senior notes would no longer have any claim against us or the applicable guarantor in the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred a holder of the senior notes may not receive any repayment on the senior notes further the avoidance of the senior notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt which could result in acceleration of that debt the measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred generally however an issuer or a guarantor as applicable would be considered insolvent if 



a court might also void the senior notes or a guarantee without regard to the above factors if the court found that the senior notes were incurred or issued or the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee with actual intent to hinder delay or defraud its creditors we cannot give any assurance as to what standard a court would apply in determining whether we or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard or regardless of the standard that a court uses that it would not determine that we or a guarantor were indeed insolvent on that date that any payments to the holders of the senior notes including under the guarantees did not constitute preferences fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds or that the issuance of the senior notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to our or any guarantor’s other debt in addition any payment by us or a guarantor pursuant to the senior notes or its guarantee could be avoided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors and accordingly the court might direct holders of the senior notes to repay any amounts already received from us or such guarantor among other things under us bankruptcy law any payment by us pursuant to the senior notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time we or such guarantor were found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a oneyear period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside party and such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such party would have received in a distribution under the bankruptcy code in a hypothetical chapter 7 case although each guarantee contains a “savings clause” intended to limit the subsidiary guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its subsidiary guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer this provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect any subsidiary guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law in that regard in official committee of unsecured creditors of tousa inc v citicorp north america inc  the united states bankruptcy court in the southern district of florida held that a savings clause similar to the savings clause included in our indentures was unenforceable as a result the subsidiary guarantees were found to be fraudulent conveyances the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit subsequently affirmed the liability findings of the bankruptcy court without ruling directly on the enforceability of savings clauses generally if the decision of the bankruptcy court in tousa were followed by other courts the risk that the guarantees would be deemed fraudulent conveyances would be significantly increased 

to the extent a court avoids the senior notes or any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or holds the senior notes or any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason the holders of the senior notes would cease to have any direct claim against us or the applicable guarantor if a court were to take this action our or the applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy our or the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities if any and might not be applied to the payment of the senior notes sufficient funds to repay the senior notes may not be available from other sources including the remaining guarantors if any in addition the euro notes 2024 and the related guarantees may be subject to avoidance under the laws of foreign jurisdictions including italy and czech republic to the extent that we the issuer of the euro notes 2024 or any of the guarantors as applicable were to be the subject of an insolvency or related proceeding in such jurisdictions 

not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our credit agreement or our senior notes and the assets of our nonguarantor subsidiaries may not be available to make payments on such obligations 

not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the credit agreement our us notes 2023 euro notes 2024 euro notes 2026 and euro notes 2028 in the event that any nonguarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent liquidates reorganizes dissolves or otherwise winds up holders of its indebtedness and its trade creditors generally will be entitled to payment on their claims from the assets of that subsidiary before any of those assets are made available to the lenders under the credit agreement or the holders of the senior notes consequently claims in respect of the credit agreement and the senior notes are structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors of such instruments including trade payables and any claims of third party holders of preferred equity interests if any in our nonguarantor subsidiaries for the year ended december 31 2019  our subsidiaries that are not borrowers under or do not guarantee the credit agreement and our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the us notes 2023 represented approximately 51 and 30 of our total revenue and operating income respectively in addition these nonguarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 54 and 55 of our total assets and total liabilities respectively as of december 31 2019 excluding in each case intercompany amounts as of the same date our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the credit agreement or the us notes 2023 had approximately 25 billion of outstanding indebtedness which includes 662 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities by foreign subsidiaries that are borrowers under the revolving credit facilities but that do not guarantee the us notes 2023 the group of subsidiaries that does not guarantee the euro notes 2024 is similar to the group that does not guarantee the us notes 2023 euro notes 2026 and euro notes 2028 except that in addition to the issuer of the euro notes 2024 there are four subsidiaries in the group that do not guarantee the us notes 2023 euro notes 2026 and euro notes 2028 that guarantee the euro notes 2024 

we may not be able to repurchase the senior notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer 

upon a change of control as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes the holders of the senior notes will have the right to require us to offer to purchase all of the senior notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101 of their 

principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest such a change of control would also be an event of default under our credit agreement in order to obtain sufficient funds to pay amounts due under the credit agreement and the purchase price of the outstanding senior notes we expect that we would have to refinance our indebtedness we cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance our indebtedness on reasonable terms if at all our failure to offer to purchase all outstanding senior notes or to purchase all validly tendered senior notes would be an event of default under the indenture such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other debt our other debt also may contain restrictions or repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture 

the definition of change of control in the indentures governing the senior notes includes a phrase relating to the sale of “all or substantially all” of our assets there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law accordingly the ability of a holder of senior notes to require us to repurchase its senior notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain 

in addition in certain circumstances as specified in the indentures governing the senior notes we will be required to commence an asset sale offer as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes pursuant to which we will be obligated to purchase certain senior notes at a price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest with the proceeds we receive from certain asset sales our other debt may contain restrictions that would limit or prohibit us from completing any such asset sale offer in particular our credit agreement contains provisions that require us upon the sale of certain assets to apply all of the proceeds from such asset sale to the prepayment of amounts due under the credit agreement the mandatory prepayment obligations under the credit agreement will be effectively senior to our obligations to make an asset sale offer with respect to the senior notes under the terms of the indentures governing the senior notes our failure to purchase any such senior notes when required under the indentures would be an event of default under the indentures 

key terms of the senior notes will be suspended if the notes achieve investment grade ratings and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing 

many of the covenants in the indentures governing the senior notes will be suspended if the senior notes are rated investment grade by standard  poor’s and moody’s provided at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing including those covenants that restrict among other things our ability to pay dividends incur liens and to enter into certain other transactions there can be no assurance that the senior notes will ever be rated investment grade however suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force although provisions under our other debt like the credit agreement may continue to restrict us from engaging in these transactions and the effects of any such transactions will be permitted to remain in place even if the senior notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade 

the liquidity and market value of the senior notes may change due to a variety of factors 

the liquidity of any trading market in the senior notes and the market price quoted for the senior notes may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for these types of securities changes in interest rates changes in our ratings and changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industries generally 

we rely on an accounts receivable securitization program for a portion of our liquidity 

we have an arrangement whereby we sell an interest in a portion of our accounts receivable to a special purpose vehicle and receive funding through the commercial paper market this arrangement expires in november 2021 in the event that the market for commercial paper were to close or otherwise become constrained our cost of credit relative to this program could rise or credit could be unavailable altogether

sources of revenue 

we report our revenue in two categories i parts and services and ii other our parts revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products including replacement parts components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty products and accessories to improve the performance functionality and appearance of vehicles our service revenue is generated primarily from the sale of servicetype warranties fees for admission to our self service yards diagnostic and repair services and processing fees related to the secure disposal of vehicles during the year ended december 31 2019 parts and services revenue represented approximately 95 of our consolidated revenue revenue from other sources includes scrap sales bulk sales to mechanical manufacturers including cores and sales of aluminum ingots and sows from our furnace operations other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold see note 5 revenue recognition  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information related to our sources of revenue 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition inventory valuation business combinations and goodwill impairment we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue actual results may differ from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

for information regarding our critical accounting policies related to revenue refer to note 5 revenue recognition to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

inventory accounting 

for all inventory carrying value is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value net realizable value can be influenced by current anticipated demand if actual demand differs from our estimates additional reductions to inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made 

for all of our aftermarket products excluding our aftermarket automotive glass products cost is established based on the average price we pay for parts for our aftermarket automotive glass products inventory cost is established using the firstin firstout method inventory cost for all of our aftermarket products includes expenses incurred for freight in and overhead costs for items purchased from foreign companies import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included refurbished inventory cost is based upon the average price we pay for cores the cost of our refurbished inventory also includes expenses incurred for freight in labor and other overhead costs our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle including auction towing and storage fees as well as expenditures for buying and dismantling vehicles inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facilitys inventory at expected selling prices the assessment of which incorporates the sales probability based 

on a parts days in stock and historical demand the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facilitys historical profitability for salvage vehicles remanufactured inventory cost is based upon the price paid for cores and also includes expenses incurred for freight direct manufacturing costs and overhead related to our remanufacturing operations the cost of manufactured product inventory is established using the firstin firstout method 

lease accounting 

on january 1 2019 we adopted accounting standards update 201602 leases asu 201602 which represents the fasb accounting standards codification topic 842 asc 842 we adopted the new guidance using the modified retrospective transition approach by applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application with no restatement of comparative periods the most significant impact was the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for operating leases refer to “recent accounting pronouncements–adoption of new lease standard” in note 4 summary of significant accounting policies ” and note 13 leases ” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the adoption of the new lease standard and our critical accounting policies related to leases 

business combinations 

we record our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values we utilize management estimates and in some instances independent third party valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and contingent consideration granted there are inherent assumptions and estimates used in developing the future cash flows and fair values of tangible and intangible assets such as projecting revenues and profits discount rates income tax rates royalty rates customer attrition rates and other various valuation assumptions we use various valuation methods to value property plant and equipment when valuing real property we typically use the sales comparison approach for land and the income approach for buildings and building improvements when valuing personal property we typically use either the income or cost approach we used the relieffromroyalty method to value trade names trademarks software and other technology assets and we used the multiperiod excess earnings method to value customer relationships the relieffromroyalty method assumes that the intangible asset has value to the extent that its owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the intangible asset the multiperiod excess earnings method is based on the present value of the incremental aftertax cash flows attributable only to the customer relationship after deducting contributory asset charges 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles impairment 

we are required to test our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually when testing goodwill for impairment we are required to evaluate events and circumstances that may affect the performance of the reporting unit and the extent to which the events and circumstances may impact the future cash flows of the reporting unit to determine whether the fair value of the assets exceeds the carrying value developing the estimated future cash flows and fair value of the reporting unit requires managements judgment in projecting revenues and profits allocation of shared corporate costs tax rates capital expenditures working capital requirements discount rates and market multiples many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates can change in future periods if these assumptions or estimates change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill 

we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist  during 2019  we did not identify any events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts therefore we did not perform any impairment tests other than our annual test in the fourth quarter as of october 31 2019  

our goodwill impairment assessment is performed by reporting unit a reporting unit is an operating segment or a business one level below an operating segment the component level for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management however components are aggregated as a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics for the purpose of aggregating our components into reporting units we review the longterm performance of segment ebitda additionally we review qualitative factors such as type or class of customers nature of products distribution methods inventory procurement methods level of integration and interdependency of processes across components our assessment of the aggregation includes both qualitative and quantitative factors and is based on the facts and circumstances specific to the components 

we have four operating segments wholesale – north america europe specialty and self service each of these operating segments consists of multiple components that have discrete financial information available that is reviewed by 

segment management on a regular basis we have evaluated these components and concluded that the components that compose the wholesale – north america europe specialty and self service operating segments are economically similar and thus were aggregated into four separate reporting units for our 2019 annual goodwill impairment test 

our goodwill would be considered impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value the fair value estimates are established using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach we believe that using two methods to determine fair value limits the chances of an unrepresentative valuation discount rates growth rates and cash flow projections are the assumptions that are most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses increases in our cost of capital adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including modifications that restrict the activities of the acquired business to assess the reasonableness of the fair value estimates we compare the sum of the reporting units’ fair values to the company’s market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium which is then evaluated against recent market transactions in our industry if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results 

we determined no impairments existed when we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing in 2019 on all four reporting units as each of those reporting units had a fair value estimate that exceeded the carrying value by at least 25 as of december 31 2019  we had a total of 44 billion in goodwill subject to future impairment tests 

based on our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2018 we determined the carrying value of our aviation reporting unit exceeded the fair value estimate by more than the carrying value thus we recorded an impairment charge of 33 million which represented the total carrying value of goodwill in our aviation reporting unit the impairment charge was due to a decrease in the fair value estimate from the prior year fair value estimate primarily driven by a significant deterioration in the outlook for the aviation reporting unit due to competition customer financial issues and changing market conditions for the airplane platforms that the business services which lowered our projected gross margin and related future cash flows we reported the impairment charge in impairment of net assets held for sale and goodwill on the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2018 we sold the aviation business in the third quarter of 2019 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we performed a quantitative impairment test in the fourth quarter as of october 31 2019  using the relieffromroyalty method to value the warn trademark which is our only indefinitelived intangible w e determined no impairment existed as the trademark had a fair value estimate which exceeded the carrying value

results of operations—segment reporting 

we have four operating segments wholesale – north america europe specialty and self service our wholesale – north america and self service operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment north america because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services customers and methods of distribution therefore we present three reportable segments north america europe and specialty 

we have presented the growth of our revenue and profitability in our operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis the constant currency presentation which is a nongaap measure excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth and profitability consistent with how we evaluate our performance as this statistic removes the translation impact of exchange rate fluctuations which are outside of our control and do not reflect our operational performance constant currency revenue and segment ebitda results are calculated by translating prior year revenue and segment ebitda in local currency using the current years currency conversion rate this nongaap financial measure has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap our use of this term may vary from the use of similarlytitled measures by other issuers due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation in addition not all companies that report revenue or profitability on a constant currency basis calculate such measures in the same manner as we do and accordingly our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarlynamed measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes liquidity data as of the dates indicated in thousands 

 we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through both internal development and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our credit facilities we utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures with the excess amounts going towards funding acquisitions paying down outstanding debt or repurchasing lkq stock as we have pursued acquisitions as part of our growth strategy our cash flows from operations have not always been sufficient to cover our investing activities to fund our acquisitions we have accessed various forms of debt financing including revolving credit facilities senior notes and our receivables securitization facility 

as of december 31 2019  we had debt outstanding and additional available sources of financing as follows 

 from time to time we may undertake financing transactions to increase our available liquidity such as i our november 2018 amendment to our senior secured credit facility and ii the issuance of the euro notes 202628 in april 2018 related to the stahlgruber acquisition given the longterm nature of our investment in stahlgruber combined with favorable interest rates we decided to fund the acquisition primarily through longterm fixed rate notes we believe this approach provides financial flexibility to execute our longterm growth strategy while maintaining availability under our revolver if we see an attractive acquisition opportunity we have the ability to use our revolver to move quickly and have certainty of funding up to the amount of our thenavailable liquidity in december 2019 we announced our intention to redeem our us notes 2023 to eliminate higher cost debt with lower interest rate borrowings on our credit facilities and cash on hand we completed the redemption in january 2020 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 19 billion available under our credit facilities combined with approximately 523 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2019  we had approximately 24 billion in available liquidity an increase of 416 million over our available liquidity as of december 31 2018  

we believe that our current liquidity and cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements although such sources may not be sufficient for future acquisitions depending on their size while we believe that we have adequate capacity from time to time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements there can be no assurance that additional funding or refinancing of our credit facilities if needed will be available on terms attractive to us or at all furthermore any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants or higher interest costs our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

beginning in 2019 a number of our european suppliers began participating in supply chain financing programs in select countries under which they may sell their accounts receivable to the participating financial institutions allowing us to extend payment terms we expect more suppliers will begin participating in supply chain financing programs in 2020 financial institutions participate in the supply chain financing program on an uncommitted basis and can cease purchasing receivables from our suppliers at any time these programs are at the sole discretion of both the supplier and the financial institution on terms that are negotiated between them if the financial institutions did not continue to purchase receivables from our suppliers under these programs the participating vendors may have a need to renegotiate their payment terms with us which in turn could cause our borrowings under our revolving credit facility to increase 

borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at variable rates which are tied to the libor or the canadian dollar offered rate cdor depending on the currency and the duration of the borrowing plus an applicable margin rate that is subject to change quarterly based on our reported leverage ratio we hold interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates on a portion of our credit agreement borrowings with the effect of fixing the interest rates on the respective notional amounts in addition we hold currency swaps that contain an interest rate swap component and a foreign currency forward contract component that when combined with related intercompany financing arrangements effectively convert variable rate us dollardenominated borrowings into fixed rate eurodenominated borrowings these derivative transactions are described in note 11 derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k after giving effect to these contracts the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2019 was 16  including our senior notes our overall weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 30 at december 31 2019  

after 2021 it is unclear whether banks will continue to provide libor submissions to the administrator of libor and no consensus currently exists as to what benchmark rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor we cannot currently predict the effect of the discontinuation of or other changes to libor or any establishment of alternative reference rates in the united states the european union or elsewhere on the global capital markets the uncertainty regarding the future of libor as well as the transition from libor to any alternative reference rate or rates could have adverse impacts on our variable rate obligations that currently use libor as a benchmark rate we are in the process of evaluating our financing obligations and other contracts that refer to libor outstanding debt under our credit agreement which constitutes the most significant of our liborbased debt obligations contains provisions that address the potential discontinuation of libor and facilitate the adoption of an alternate rate of interest we do not believe that the discontinuation of libor or its replacement with an alternative reference rate or rates will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or liquidity 

cash interest payments were 143 million for the year ended december 31 2019  including 92 million in semiannual interest payments on our us notes 2023 euro notes 2024 and euro notes 20262028 interest payments on our euro notes 2024 and euro notes 20262028 are made in april and october 

we had outstanding credit agreement borrowings of 16 billion and 17 billion at december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  respectively of these amounts 18 million and 9 million was classified as current maturities at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

the scheduled maturities of longterm obligations outstanding at december 31 2019 are as follows in thousands 



 our credit agreement contains customary covenants that impose limitations and conditions on our ability to enter into certain transactions the credit agreement also contains financial and affirmative covenants including limitations on our net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our credit agreement as of december 31 2019  

the following summarizes our required debt covenants and our actual ratios with respect to those covenants as calculated per the credit agreement as of december 31 2019 



the terms net leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio used in the credit agreement are specifically calculated per the credit agreement and differ in specified ways from comparable gaap or common usage terms 

as of december 31 2019  the company had cash and cash equivalents of 523 million  of which 234 million was held by foreign subsidiaries in general it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and that position has not changed following the enactment of the tax act and the related imposition of the transition tax distributions of dividends from our foreign subsidiaries if any would be generally exempt from further us taxation either as a result of the new 100 participation exemption under the tax act or due to the previous taxation of foreign earnings under the transition tax and the gilti regime we believe that we have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our financial obligations in the us without repatriating our foreign earnings we may from time to time choose to selectively repatriate foreign earnings if doing so supports our financing or liquidity objectives

accounts payable produced an incremental 81 million in cash inflows primarily due to timing effects related to our may 30 2018 acquisition of stahlgruber additionally we increased accounts payable through extension of vendor terms in north america the supply chain financing programs in europe did not have a material impact on accounts payable in 2019 

accounts receivable represented an incremental 26 million in cash inflows in 2019 primarily attributable to focus on collections in our specialty segment and uk operations which was partially offset by timing effects from the stahlgruber acquisition and to a lesser extent the unwind of a receivables factoring program at stahlgruber

we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of distribution centers processing and sales facilities and warehouses through further integration of our facilities and through selected business acquisitions our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in 

 foreign exchange rates 

foreign currency fluctuations may impact the financial results we report for the portions of our business that operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar our operations outside of the us represented 503 and 479 of our revenue during 2019 and 2018  respectively an increase or decrease in the strength of the us dollar against these currencies by 10 would result in a 50 change in our consolidated revenue and a 29 change in our operating income for the year ended december 31 2019  see our results of operations discussion in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our year over year results 

additionally we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket products from foreign countries primarily in europe and asia to the extent that our inventory purchases are not denominated in the functional currency of the purchasing location we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in several of our operations we purchase inventory from manufacturers in taiwan in us dollars which exposes us to fluctuations in the relationship between the local functional currency and the us dollar as well as fluctuations between the us dollar and the taiwan dollar we hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations related to a portion of inventory purchases in our europe operations but the notional amount and fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2019 were immaterial we do not currently attempt to hedge foreign currency exposure related to our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in our north america operations and we may not be able to pass on any resulting price increases to our customers 

other than with respect to a portion of our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases we do not hold derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency risk our net investment in foreign operations is partially hedged by the foreign currency denominated borrowings we use to fund foreign acquisitions however our ability to use foreign currency denominated borrowings to finance our foreign operations may be limited based on local tax laws we have elected not to hedge the foreign currency risk related to the interest payments on foreign borrowings as we generate cash flows in the local currencies that can be used to fund debt payments as of december 31 2019  we had outstanding borrowings of €500 million under our euro notes 2024 €10 billion under our euro notes 202628 and £208 million €229 million cad 130 million and sek 270 million under our revolving credit facilities as of december 31 2018  we had outstanding borrowings of €500 million under our euro notes 2024 €10 billion under our euro notes 202628 and £290 million €163 million cad 130 million and sek 275 million under our revolving credit facilities 

interest rates 

our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facilities where interest rates are tied to the prime rate libor or cdor therefore we implemented a policy to manage our exposure to variable interest rates on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt instruments through the use of interest rate swap contracts these contracts convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt matching the currency effective dates and maturity dates to specific debt instruments net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swap contracts are included as adjustments to interest expense all of our interest rate swap contracts have been executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy wells fargo bank na bank of america na citizens na hsbc bank usa na and banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria sa 

as of december 31 2019  we held eight interest rate swap contracts representing a total of 480 million of us dollardenominated notional amount debt our interest rate swap contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and modify the variable rate nature of that portion of our variable rate debt these swaps have maturity dates ranging from january 2021 through june 2021 as of december 31 2019  the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was an asset of 3 million  the values of such contracts are subject to changes in interest rates 

in addition to these interest rate swaps as of december 31 2019 we held four cross currency swap agreements for a total notional amount of 467 million €435 million with maturity dates in october 2020 and january 2021 these cross currency swaps contain an interest rate swap component and a foreign currency forward contract component that combined with related intercompany financing arrangements effectively convert variable rate us dollardenominated borrowings into fixed rate eurodenominated borrowings the swaps are intended to reduce uncertainty in cash flows in us dollars and euros in connection with intercompany financing arrangements the cross currency swaps were also executed with banks we believe 

are creditworthy wells fargo bank na bank of america na and mufg bank ltd mufg formerly known as the bank of tokyomitsubishi ufj ltd as of december 31 2019  the fair values of the interest rate swap components of the cross currency swaps were an immaterial asset and a liability of 1 million and the fair values of the foreign currency forward components were an asset of 3 million and a liability of 23 million the values of these contracts are subject to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in total we had 59 of our variable rate debt under our credit facilities at fixed rates at december 31 2019 compared to 57 at december 31 2018  see note 10 longterm obligations  and note 11 derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

at december 31 2019  we had approximately  663 million of variable rate debt that was not hedged using sensitivity analysis a 100 basis point movement in interest rates would change interest expense by 7 million over the next twelve months redeeming the us notes 2023 in january 2020 increased our unhedged variable rate debt by 415 million  

commodity prices 

we are exposed to market risk related to price fluctuations in scrap metal and other metals including precious metals such as platinum palladium and rhodium market prices of these metals affect the amount that we pay for our inventory and the revenue that we generate from sales of these metals as both our revenue and costs are affected by the price fluctuations we have a natural hedge against the changes however there is typically a lag between the effect on our revenue from metal price fluctuations and inventory cost changes and there is no guarantee that the vehicle costs will decrease or increase at the same rate as the metals prices therefore we can experience positive or negative gross margin effects in periods of rising or falling metals prices particularly when such prices move rapidly additionally if market prices were to change at a greater rate than our vehicle acquisition costs we could experience a positive or negative effect on our operating margin the average of scrap metal prices for 2019 has decreased 28 over the average for 2018

 item 1   business 

overview 

lkq corporation lkq or the company is a global distributor of vehicle products including replacement parts components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty products and accessories to improve the performance functionality and appearance of vehicles 

buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers oems new products produced by companies other than the oems which are referred to as aftermarket products recycled products obtained from salvage vehicles used products that have been refurbished and used products that have been remanufactured collectively we refer to these four sources that are not new oem products as alternative parts we distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops including aftermarket collision and mechanical products recycled collision and mechanical products refurbished collision products such as wheels bumper covers and lights and remanufactured engines and transmissions 

we are a leading provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products with our sales processing and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the united states and canada we are also a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement and maintenance products in the united kingdom germany the benelux region belgium netherlands and luxembourg italy czech republic poland slovakia austria and various other european countries in addition to our wholesale operations we operate self service retail facilities across the us that sell recycled automotive products from endoflife vehicles we are also a leading distributor of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories reaching most major markets in the us and canada 

we are organized into four operating segments wholesale  north america europe specialty and self service we aggregate our wholesale  north america and self service operating segments into one reportable segment north america resulting in three reportable segments north america europe and specialty see note 16 segment and geographic information  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for financial information by reportable segment and by geographic region 

history 

we were initially formed in 1998 through the combination of a number of wholesale recycled products businesses located in florida michigan ohio and wisconsin we subsequently expanded through internal development and approximately 270 acquisitions of aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured product suppliers and manufacturers self service retail businesses and specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories suppliers our most significant acquisitions include 

 further information regarding our recent acquisitions is included in note 2 business combinations to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

strategy 

our mission is to be the leading global valueadded distributor of vehicle parts and accessories by offering our customers the most comprehensive available and costeffective selection of part solutions while building strong partnerships with our employees and the communities in which we operate 

we have four primary pillars of a strategy to build economic value growth through diversified product offerings growth through geographic expansion adaptation to evolving technology and rationalization of our asset base to enhance margins and return on capital we believe our supply network with a broad inventory of quality alternative collision and mechanical repair products and specialty vehicle aftermarket products high fulfillment rates and superior customer service provides us with a competitive advantage to execute our strategy we are focused on a number of key areas including 

 north america segment 

our north america segment is composed of wholesale operations which consists of aftermarket and salvage operations self service retail operations and aviation operations 

wholesale operations 

inventory 

our wholesale operations in north america sell five product types aftermarket recycled remanufactured refurbished and to a lesser extent oem parts to professional collision and mechanical automobile repair businesses our principal aftermarket product types consist of those most frequently damaged in collisions including bumper covers automotive body 

panels lights and automotive glass products such as windshields platinum plus is our exclusive product line offered under the keystone brand of aftermarket products certain of our products are certified by independent organizations such as the certified automotive parts association “capa” and nsf international “nsf” capa and nsf are associations that evaluate the quality of aftermarket collision replacement products compared to oem collision replacement products we also developed a product line called value line for more value conscious often selfpay consumers our salvage products include both mechanical and collision parts including engines transmissions door assemblies sheet metal products such as trunk lids fenders and hoods lights and bumper assemblies 

the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from independent manufacturers and distributors located primarily in north america and asia principally taiwan in 2018 approximately 39 of our aftermarket purchases were made from our top 4 vendors with our largest vendor providing approximately 15 of our annual inventory purchases we believe we are one of the largest customers of each of these suppliers outside of this group no other supplier provided more than 5 of our supply of aftermarket products in 2018 we purchased approximately 47 of our aftermarket products in 2018 directly from manufacturers in taiwan and other asian countries approximately 50 of our aftermarket products were purchased from vendors located in the us however we believe the majority of these products were manufactured in taiwan mexico or other foreign countries 

within our wholesale operations we focus our procurement on products that are in the most demand based on a number of factors such as historical sales records of vehicles by model and year customer requests and projections of future supply and demand trends because lead times may be 40 days or more on imported aftermarket products sales volumes and instock inventory are important factors in the procurement process 

in our aftermarket operations we use a third party enterprise management system and other third party software packages to leverage the centralized data and information that a single system provides such as a data warehouse to conduct enhanced analytics and reporting an integrated budgeting system an electronic data interchange tool and ecommerce tools to enhance our online businesstobusiness initiatives  orderkeystonecom and keyless 

we procure recycled products for our wholesale operations by acquiring total loss vehicles typically sold at regional salvage auctions and then dismantling and inventorying the parts the availability and pricing of the salvage vehicles we procure for our wholesale recycled products operations may be impacted by a variety of factors including the production level of new vehicles and the percentage of damaged vehicles declared total losses our bidding specialists are equipped with a proprietary software application that allows them to compare the vehicles at salvage auctions against our current inventory levels historical demand and recent average selling prices to arrive at an estimated maximum bid 

our wholesale recycled product locations in north america operate an internallydeveloped proprietary enterprise management system called lkqx we believe that the use of a single system across all of our wholesale recycled product operations helps facilitate the sales process allows for continued implementation of standard operating procedures and yields improved training efficiency employee transferability access to our national inventory database management reporting and data storage the system also supports an electronic exchange process for identifying and locating parts at other select recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock 

scrap and other materials 

our salvage operations generate scrap metal and other materials that we sell to metals recyclers vehicles that have been dismantled for recycled products and crush only endoflife vehicles acquired from other companies are typically crushed using equipment on site in other cases we will hire mobile crushing equipment to crush the vehicles before they are transported to shredders and scrap metal processors damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products including wheels we also extract and sell the precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts such as catalytic converters 

customers 

we sell our products to wholesale customers that include collision and mechanical repair shops and new and used car dealerships as well as to retail customers the majority of these customers tend to be individuallyowned small businesses although the number of independent and dealeroperated collision repair facilities has declined over the last decade as regional or national multiplelocation operators have increased their geographic presence through consolidation 

automobile insurance companies affect the demand for our collision products while insurance companies do not pay for our products directly they ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount as a result insurance companies often influence the types of products used in a repair the use of our products instead of oem products provides a direct benefit to insurance companies by lowering the cost of repairs decreasing the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and providing a replacement product that is of high quality and comparable performance to the part replaced 

our sales personnel are encouraged to promote lkq to customers as a “onestop shop” by offering comparable options from our other product lines if the desired part is not in stock to support these efforts we have provided our sales staff with access to both recycled and aftermarket sales systems to encourage cross selling 

to better serve our customers we take a consolidated approach to the electronic sale of wholesale products in our north america segment a full suite of ecommerce services is available to approved partners that helps us improve order accuracy reduce return rate and better fit our customer workflow using these services in coordination with our partners products can be searched priced and ordered without leaving the customers own operating systems 

distribution 

we have a distribution network of warehouses and cross dock facilities which allows us to develop and maintain our service levels with local repair shops while providing fulfillment rates that are made possible by our nationwide presence our delivery fleet utilizes a third party software provider to optimize delivery routes and to track the progress of delivery vehicles throughout their runs our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries as required by our customers using drivers who routinely deliver to the same customers our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network we operate a delivery fleet of mediumsized trucks and smaller trucks and vans which deliver multiple product types on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs and improve customer service 

competition 

we consider all suppliers of vehicle collision and mechanical products to be competitors including aftermarket suppliers recycling businesses refurbishing operations parts remanufacturers oems and internetbased suppliers we compete with alternative parts distributors on the basis of our nationwide distribution system our product lines and inventory availability customer service our relationships with insurance companies and to a lesser extent price we compete with oems primarily on the basis of price and to a lesser extent on service and product quality we do not consider retail chains that focus on the doityourself market to be our direct competitors   since many of our wholesale product sales are influenced by insurance companies who ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount rather than the end user and there is limited overlap in the products that we sell 

self service operations 

our self service retail operations most of which operate under the name “lkq pick your part” allow consumers to come directly to the yard to pick parts off of salvage vehicles in addition to revenue from the sale of parts core and scrap we charge a nominal admission fee to access the property 

inventory 

we acquire inventory for our self service retail product operations from a variety of sources including but not limited to towing companies vehicle auctions the general public municipality sales insurance carriers and charitable organizations we typically procure salvage vehicles for our self service retail product operations that are generally older and of lower price than the salvage vehicles we purchase for our wholesale recycled product operations vehicles are delivered to our locations by the seller or we arrange for transportation once on our property minimal labor is required to process the vehicle other than removing the battery fluids refrigerants catalytic converters and hazardous materials the extracted fluids are stored in bulk and subsequently sold to recyclers vehicles are then placed in the yard for customers to remove parts in our self service business availability of a specific part will depend on which vehicles are currently at the site and to what extent parts may have been previously sold we usually keep a vehicle at our facility for 30 to 120 days depending on the capacity of the yard and size of the market before it is crushed and sold to scrap metal processors 

scrap and other materials 

our self service operations generate scrap metal alloys and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that we no longer make available to the public and crush only vehicles acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products including wheels we also extract and sell the precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts such as catalytic converters 

customers 

the customers of our self service yards are frequently doityourself mechanics small independent repair shops servicing older vehicles auto rebuilders and resellers the scrap from the vehicle hulks when not processed by us is sold to metals recyclers with whom we may also compete when procuring salvage vehicles for our operations 

competition 

there are competitors operating self service businesses in all of the markets in which we operate in some markets there are numerous competitors often operating in close proximity to our operations we try to differentiate our business by the quality of the inventory and the size and cleanliness of the property we also differentiate our business from our competitors through our app which allows customers to receive daily push notifications when cars they are interested in are placed into their favorite yards in addition to allowing customers to see our available inventory the app also allows customers to input search parameters such as the specific part they are searching for and the year make and model of the vehicle in an effort to expand the number of cars that might be available to pull parts from we do not consider retail chains that focus on the doityourself market to be our direct competitors as there is limited overlap in the products that we sell 

aviation operations 

our aviation operations specialize in the sale of recycled aviation parts including aircraft structural components and spare parts complete engines engine components and whole airplanes to regional maintenance repair and overhaul providers aircraft operators fixedbase operators corporate customers and other aviation dealers and distributors around the globe our aviation business is located in the us with sales representation in mexico and the uk our aviation business comprises approximately 1 of our north america segment revenue 

europe segment 

our europe segment was built on four key acquisitions ecp 2011 sator 2013 rhiag 2016 and stahlgruber 2018 additionally in 2014 we expanded our european segment to include wholesale recycling operations through our acquisition of a business with salvage and vehicle repair facilities in sweden and norway and in 2016 we acquired an equity investment in mekonomen ab mekonomen the leading independent car parts and service chain in the nordic region of europe mekonomen is independent of our existing european operations but we are exploring areas where the companies can work together in a mutually beneficial manner primarily related to procurement our european strategy is to target platform acquisitions to cover broad markets initially then integrate these businesses with our other operations and subsequently expand our footprint in these regions through new branch openings and smaller tuckin acquisitions with the goal of eventually attaining continentwide coverage our acquisitions provide a platform to capitalize on the large and fragmented aftermarket mechanical replacement parts market in europe and allow for potential cost savings from the leveraging of our combined purchasing power given the significant overlap in suppliers and product mix we have acquired many smaller businesses within the regions we operate and over time we anticipate further integration of our european operations as we optimize purchasing warehousing cataloging logistics and backoffice functions and align our private label brands across the segment 

inventory 

our inventory is primarily composed of mechanical aftermarket parts for the repair of vehicles 3 to 15 years old our top selling products include brake pads discs and sensors clutches electrical products such as spark plugs and batteries steering and suspension products filters and oil and automotive fluids in addition to mechanical aftermarket parts we also sell collision parts in our europe segment although these sales represent less than 2 of total europe segment revenue 

in 2018 our top two suppliers represented 12 of our aftermarket inventory purchases with our top supplier representing approximately 7 of our purchases no other suppliers comprised more than 5 of our purchases during 2018 the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from vendors located primarily in the uk and continental europe in 2018 we purchased 93 of our products from companies in europe the remaining 7 of our 2018 purchases were sourced from vendors located primarily in china or taiwan some of which also supply collision parts for our wholesale  north america operations in 2018 66 22 6 and 3 of our total inventory purchases were made in euros pounds sterling us dollars and czech koruna respectively 

our aftermarket operations in europe use various information technology “it” systems our systems are complex and are designed to do a variety of tasks depending on the market including manage customer orders and inventory movement optimize our warehouse and logistics and financial reporting certain of our it systems can interface with our repair shop customers respective it systems which enables them to identify the part required for the repair in 2018 as part of our strategy to create an integrated european company we initiated a multiyear program to develop a european wide erp system which will reduce the number of it systems we operate 

in our nordic operations we purchase severely damaged or totaled vehicles from insurance companies which are transferred to our dismantling facilities or sold to other third party dismantlers 

customers 

we primarily operate a twostep ie direct sales to customers distribution model in europe although certain of our operations such as italy the netherlands germany switzerland and hungary operate wholly or partially a threestep ie 

sales to distributors who in turn sell to customers distribution model in our twostep operations we sell the majority of our products to commercial customers primarily consisting of professional repairers including both independent mechanical repair shops and collision repair shops in our threestep operations we sell products to wholesale distributors or jobbers in addition to our sales to repair shops and wholesale distributors we generate a portion of our revenue through sales to retail customers from ecommerce platforms and from counter sales at the branch locations 

distribution 

our european operations employ a distribution model in which inventory is stored at national or international distribution centers or regional hubs with fast moving product stored at branch locations where we operate a twostep distribution model the large distribution centers regularly restock the smaller branches and hubs and hold slower moving items allowing us high fulfillment rates product is moved through the distribution network on our vans or via common carrier 

  competition 

we view all suppliers of replacement repair products as our competitors including other alternative parts suppliers and oems and their dealer networks we face significant competition in many markets where even smaller competitors can compete on price and service and the oem’s compete via ties to and brand loyalty of the consumer while also remaining competitive on price service and availability we believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other alternative parts suppliers primarily through our distribution network efficient stock management systems and proprietary technology which allows us to deliver our products quickly as well as through our product lines and inventory availability pricing and service 

specialty segment 

our specialty operating segment was formed in 2014 with our acquisition of keystone specialty a leading distributor and marketer of specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories in north america our specialty operations reach most major markets in the us and canada and serve the following six product segments rv truck and offroad towing speed and performance wheels tires and performance handling and miscellaneous accessories in 2017 we acquired warn industries inc warn a leading designer manufacturer and marketer of high performance vehicle equipment and accessories the acquisition of warn expanded our presence in the specialty market and creates viable points of entry into related markets 

inventory   

the specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories we distribute and raw materials for products we manufacture are purchased from suppliers located primarily in the us canada and china our top selling products are rv appliances  air conditioners towing hitches truck bed covers vehicle protection products cargo management products and wheels tires  suspension products specialty aftermarket suppliers are typically small to mediumsized independent businesses that focus on a narrow product or market niche due to the highly fragmented supplier base for specialty vehicle aftermarket products we have limited supplier concentration in 2018 approximately 14 of our specialty vehicle aftermarket purchases were made from our top two suppliers with our largest supplier providing approximately 9 of our annual inventory purchases no other suppliers comprised more than 5 of our purchases during 2018 with our 2017 acquisition of warn we have internal manufacturing capabilities to source aftermarket winches hoists and bumpers 

most of our specialty operations utilize an internally developed inventory management and order entry system that interfaces with third party software systems for accounting transaction processing data analytics and reporting 

customers 

overall the specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and accessories market serves a fragmented customer base composed of rv and specialty automotive dealers installers jobbers builders parts chains and mailorder businesses our customers are principally small independent businesses these customers depend on us to provide a broad range of products rapid delivery marketing support and technical assistance in addition to traditional customers in recent years we have increased sales to several large parts and accessory online retailers our specialty segment also operates retail stores in northeast pennsylvania 

we promote our products to customers through marketing programs which include i catalogs advertising sponsorships and promotional activities ii product level marketing and merchandising support and iii online and digital marketing initiatives our national footprint allows us to stage trade shows across the us which provide an opportunity to improve sales through the showcasing of new and innovative products from our vendors to our customers 

online sales of our specialty products take place primarily through our ekeystonecom and viantpcom sites and mobile app these sites provide customers i the ability to match products with the make and model of vehicle thus allowing the customer to order the right part ii product information eg pictures attributes available for review and iii the convenience of searching inventory availability and ordering the product on the site additionally the site can provide sales opportunities by suggesting other parts to purchase based on an inquiry submitted by the customer 

distribution 

our specialty segment operations employ a hubandspoke distribution model which enables us to transport products from our primary distribution centers to our noninventory stocking cross docks a majority of which are colocated with our north america wholesale operations and provide distribution points to key regional markets and synergies with our existing infrastructure we believe this provides added value to our customers through a broader product offering and more efficient distribution process we use our delivery routes to provide delivery and returns of our products directly to and from our customers in all 48 continental us states and 9 canadian provinces and we ship globally to customers in other countries our delivery fleet utilizes a third party software provider to optimize delivery routes and to track the progress of delivery vehicles throughout their runs 

competition 

industry participants have a variety of supply choices vendors can deliver products to market via warehouse distributors and mail order catalog businesses or directly to retailers andor consumers we view all suppliers of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories as our competitors we believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and equipment suppliers primarily through our broad product selection which encompasses both popular and hardtofind products our national distribution network and efficient inventory management systems as well as through our service we compete on the basis of product breadth and depth rapid and dependable delivery marketing initiatives support services and price 

intellectual property 

we own and have the right to use various intellectual property including intellectual property acquired as a result of past acquisitions in addition to trade names trademarks and patents we also have technologybased intellectual property that has been both internally developed and obtained through license agreements and acquisitions we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any single item of intellectual property or any single group of related intellectual property owned or licensed nor would the expiration of any particular item or related group of intellectual property or the termination of any particular intellectual property license agreement materially affect our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2018 we employed approximately 51000 persons of which approximately 22500 were employed in north america and approximately 28500 were employed outside of north america of our employees in north america approximately 1200 were represented by unions outside of north america we have governmentmandated collective bargaining agreements and union contracts in certain countries particularly in europe where many of our employees are represented by unions andor works councils we consider our employee relations to be good 

facilities 

as of december 31 2018 our operations included approximately 1700 facilities most of which are leased of our total facilities approximately 550 facilities were located in the us and approximately 1150 facilities were located in 24 other countries many of our locations stock multiple product types or serve more than one function 

our global headquarters are located at 500 west madison street chicago illinois 60661 our north american headquarters in nashville tennessee performs certain centralized functions for our north american operations including accounting procurement and information systems support in 2018 we expanded the size of our north american headquarters via construction of a new 100000 square foot facility in nashville our european operations are distributed throughout europe with some main offices in tamworth england in schiedam and amsterdam the netherlands in milan italy in prague czech republic and in poing germany in addition to these offices we have two national distribution centers in tamworth totaling 1000000 and 500000 square feet respectively which house inventory to supply the hubs and branches of our uk and republic of ireland operations and one international distribution center in sulzbachrosenberg germany which supplies our recently acquired stahlgruber’s operations in germany austria italy slovenia and croatia our specialty operations maintain primary procurement accounting and finance functions in exeter pennsylvania certain backoffice support functions for our segments are performed in bangalore india additionally we operate an aftermarket parts warehouse in taiwan to aggregate inventory for shipment to our locations in north america 

regulation 

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment in the us and the other countries in which we operate see the risk factor “ we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters ” in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding the effects of environmental laws and regulations on us 

we may be affected by tariffs and other import laws and restrictions because we import into the us a significant number of products for sale and distribution see the risk factors “ if significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on products or materials we import or any related countermeasures are taken by countries to which we export products our revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed ” and “ intellectual property claims relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business ” in part 1 item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding importation risks 

  our business processes and operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection see the risk factor “ the costs of complying with the requirements of laws pertaining to the privacy and security of personal information and the potential liability associated with the failure to comply with such laws could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations ” in part 1 item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for further information about privacy and data protection risks 

  some jurisdictions have enacted laws to restrict or prohibit the sale of alternative vehicle parts see the risk factor “ existing or new laws and regulations may prohibit restrict or burden the sale of aftermarket recycled refurbished or remanufactured products ” in part 1 item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for further information concerning regulatory restrictions on the sale of our products 

  we have thousands of employees located in the us and many other countries and are subject to labor and employment laws in numerous jurisdictions see the risk factor “ our business may be adversely affected by union activities and labor and employment laws ” in part 1 item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding these labor and employment risks 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related repairs our specialty vehicle operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the second quarter when vehicle owners tend to install this equipment and lower revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter when the number of rv trips tends to decline as a result of the winter weather our aftermarket glass operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the second and third quarters when the demand for automotive replacement glass increases after the winter weather 




 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

our operating results and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the economic and political conditions in the us and elsewhere 

changes in economic and political conditions in the us europe and other countries in which we are located or do business could have a material effect on our company changes in such conditions have in some periods resulted in fewer miles driven fewer accident claims and a reduction of vehicle repairs all of which could negatively affect our business the number and types of new vehicles produced and sold by manufacturers affects our business a decrease in the number of vehicles on the road results in a decrease in repairs 

our sales are also impacted by changes to the economic health of vehicle owners the economic health of vehicle owners is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit taxation fuel prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside of our control if any of these conditions worsen our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities and hedge transactions these unfavorable events affecting our business partners could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we have a substantial business presence in europe including a significant presence in the uk and the republic of ireland “roi” in june 2016 voters in the uk decided by referendum to withdraw from the european union also known as brexit the precise timing and impacts of this action on our businesses in the uk and other parts of europe are unknown at this time since the vote we have seen fluctuations in exchange rates leading to cost pressures and unfavorable translation effects on our sterling denominated earnings depending upon how the details of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union are negotiated and implemented our european businesses could be adversely affected as a result of further fluctuations in exchange rates disruptions to access to markets by uk and roi companies interruptions of the movement of goods and services between countries a decrease of economic activity in europe and political or social unrest the uk’s withdrawal from the european union is scheduled to occur on march 29 2019 the uk and the european union have been attempting to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal but have not been able to reach an agreement unless there is an agreed extension or cancellation of the withdrawal the withdrawal will occur on march 29 2019 if no negotiated withdrawal agreement is reached businesses including ours will likely experience greater disruptions and risks than would occur compared with a negotiated withdrawal 

we face intense competition from local national international and internetbased vehicle products providers and this competition could negatively affect our business 

the vehicle replacement products industry and vehicle accessory parts industry are highly competitive and are served by numerous suppliers of oem recycled aftermarket refurbished and remanufactured products within each of these categories of suppliers there are local owneroperated companies larger regional suppliers national and international providers and internetbased suppliers and distributors providers of vehicle replacement and accessory products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of vehicle products which may further increase competition some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise greater financial technical manufacturing distribution and other resources longer operating histories lower cost structures and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries or with consumers than we do 

in certain regions of the us local vehicle recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in the wholesale recycled products industry similarly in europe some local companies are part of cooperative efforts to compete in the aftermarket parts industry as a result of these factors our competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply provide their products at lower costs or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve 

we believe that a majority of collision parts by dollar amount are supplied by oems with the balance being supplied by distributors of alternative aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured collision parts like us the oems are therefore able to exert pricing pressure in the marketplace we compete with the oems primarily on price and to a lesser extent on service and quality from time to time the oems have implemented programs seeking to increase their market share in the collision repair parts industry for example they have reduced prices on specific products to match the lower prices of alternative products and introduced other rebate programs that may disrupt our sales the growth of these programs or the introduction of new ones could have a material adverse impact on our business 

in addition vehicles are being equipped with systems that transmit data to the oems wirelessly regarding among other items accident incidents maintenance requirements location of the vehicle identification of the closest dealership and other statistics about the vehicle and its driving history to the extent that this data is not shared with alternative suppliers the oems will have an advantage with respect to such matters as contacting the vehicle driver recommending repairs and maintenance and directing the vehicle owner to an affiliated dealership 

we rely upon our customers and insurance companies to promote the usage of alternative parts 

our success depends in part on the acceptance and promotion of alternative parts usage by automotive insurance companies and vehicle repair facilities there can be no assurance that current levels of alternative parts usage will be maintained or will increase in the future 

we rely on business relationships with insurance companies these insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide the business relationships include in some cases participation in aftermarket quality and service assurance programs that may result in a higher usage of our aftermarket products than would be the case without the programs our arrangements with these companies may be terminated by them at any time including in connection with their own business concerns relating to the offering availability standards or operations of the aftermarket quality and service assurance programs we rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in an illinois lawsuit involving state farm mutual automobile insurance company avery v state farm a jury decided in october 1999 that state farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using nonoem replacement products to repair damaged vehicles when use of such products did not restore the vehicle to its preloss condition the jury found that state farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of nonoem replacement products and the alleged inferiority of those products the jury assessed damages against state farm of 456 million and the judge assessed an additional 730 million of disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the illinois consumer fraud act in april 2001 the illinois appellate court upheld the verdict but reduced the damage award by 130 million because of duplicative damage awards on august 18 2005 the illinois supreme court reversed the awards made by the circuit court and found among other things that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any breach of contract by state farm the us supreme court declined to hear an appeal of this case as a result of this case some insurance companies reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket products our financial results could be adversely affected if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled products from us due to a fear of similar claims 

in addition to the extent that the collision repair industry continues to consolidate the buying power of collision repair shop customers may further increase putting additional pressure on our financial returns 

we may not be able to successfully acquire new businesses or integrate acquisitions which could cause our growth and profitability objectives to suffer 

we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms if we do not obtain required antitrust or other regulatory approvals or for other reasons moreover we may not be able to identify a sufficient number of acquisition candidates at reasonable prices to maintain our inorganic growth objectives andor be able to successfully integrate acquisitions 

if we buy a company or a division of a company we may experience difficulty integrating that companys or divisions personnel and operations which could negatively affect our operating results in addition 



 intellectual property claims relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business  

oems and others have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims the oems have brought such claims in federal court and with the us international trade commission us customs and border protection have used claims of intellectual property infringement to seize certain of our aftermarket parts as we attempted to import them into the us 

to the extent oems and other manufacturers obtain design patents and trademarks and are successful in asserting infringement of these patents and trademarks and defending their validity we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business we will likely incur significant expenses investigating and defending intellectual property infringement claims in addition aftermarket products certifying organizations may revoke the certification of parts that are the subject of the claims lack of certification may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of aftermarket products only if they have been certified by an independent certifying organization 

in december 2005 and may 2008 ford global technologies llc filed complaints with the international trade commission against us and others alleging that certain aftermarket products imported into the us infringed on ford design patents the parties settled these matters in april 2009 pursuant to a patent license arrangement that is currently scheduled to expire in march 2020 in january 2014 chrysler group llc filed a complaint against us in the us district court in the eastern district of michigan contending that certain aftermarket parts we sell infringe chrysler design patents the parties settled this matter in june 2014 pursuant to a patent license arrangement that expires in june 2019 in the event that these license arrangements or other similar license arrangements with oems are terminated or we are unable to agree upon renewal terms we may be subject to costs and uncertainties of litigation as well as restrictions on our ability to sell aftermarket parts that replicate parts covered by design patents 

if the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines or the number of cars being repaired declines or the mix of the types of vehicles in the overall vehicle population changes our business could suffer 

our business depends on vehicle accidents mechanical failures and routine maintenance for both the demand for repairs using our products and the supply of recycled remanufactured and refurbished parts to the extent that a relatively higher percentage of damaged vehicles are declared total losses there will be less demand for our products to repair such vehicles in addition our business is impacted by factors which influence the number andor severity of accidents and mechanical failures including but not limited to the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven the ages of drivers the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions the congestion of traffic drivers distracted by electronic equipment the use of alcohol or drugs by drivers the usage rate and effectiveness of accident avoidance systems in new vehicles the reliability of new oem parts and the condition of roadways for example an increase in the acceptance of ridesharing could reduce the number of vehicles on the road additionally an increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the need for mechanical repairs and maintenance to decline as motorists seek alternative transportation options mild weather conditions particularly during winter months tend to result in a decrease in vehicle accidents moreover legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones or other electronic devices while driving could lead to a decline in accidents 

systems designed to minimize accident frequency and severity are becoming more prevalent and more technologically sophisticated to the extent oems install or are mandated by law to install accident avoidance systems in their vehicles the number and severity of accidents could decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the average number of new vehicles sold annually has fluctuated from yeartoyear periods of decreased sales could result in a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road and consequently fewer vehicles involved in accidents or in need of mechanical repair or maintenance substantial further declines in automotive sales in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition in addition if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of older vehicles on the road insurance companies may find it uneconomical to repair such vehicles or there could be less costly repairs if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of newer vehicles on the road the demand generally for mechanical repairs and maintenance would likely decline due to the newer longerlasting parts in the vehicle population and mechanical failures being covered by oem warranties for the first years of a vehicles life moreover alternative collision and mechanical parts are less likely to be used on newer vehicles our specialty segment depends on sales of pickup trucks sport utility vehicles crossover utility vehicles high performance vehicles and 

recreational vehicles any reduction in the number of such vehicles in operation will adversely affect demand for our specialty products 

electric vehicles do not have traditional engines transmissions and certain related parts engines and transmissions represent some of our largest revenue generating skus in north america and parts for engines and transmissions represent a significant amount of the revenue of our european operations thus an increase in electric vehicles as a percentage of vehicles sold will have a negative impact on our sales of engines transmissions and other related parts 

fluctuations in the prices of metals and other commodities could adversely affect our financial results 

our recycling operations generate scrap metal and other metals that we sell after we dismantle a salvage vehicle for wholesale parts and after vehicles have been processed in our self service retail business the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors and other remaining metals are sold to processors and brokers of metals in addition we receive crush only vehicles from other companies including oems which we dismantle and which generate scrap metal and other metals the prices of scrap and other metals have historically fluctuated sometimes significantly due to market factors in addition buyers may stop purchasing metals entirely due to excess supply to the extent that the prices of metals decrease materially or buyers stop purchasing metals our revenue from such sales will suffer and a writedown of our inventory value could be required for example china has recently imposed a ban on the importation of 32 types of solid waste allegedly in an effort to reduce environmental pollution this ban includes certain metals that we sell and will likely have the effect of reducing the prices of such products 

the cost of our wholesale recycled and our self service retail inventory purchases will change as a result of fluctuating scrap metal and other metals prices in a period of falling metal prices there can be no assurance that our inventory purchasing cost will decrease the same amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal and other metals prices decline and there may be a delay between the scrap metal and other metals price reductions and any inventory cost reductions the prices of steel aluminum and plastics are components of the cost to manufacture products for our aftermarket business if the prices of commodities rise and result in higher costs to us for products we sell we may not be able to pass these higher costs on to our customers 

existing or new laws and regulations may prohibit restrict or burden the sale of aftermarket recycled refurbished or remanufactured products  

most states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair work these laws include requirements relating to consumer disclosure vehicle owner’s consent regarding the use of aftermarket products in the repair process and the requirement to have aftermarket products certified by an independent testing organization additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future if additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business 

certain organizations test the quality and safety of vehicle replacement products if these organizations decide not to test a particular vehicle product or in the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product such events could adversely affect our business 

some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags in addition laws relating to the regulation of parts affecting vehicle emissions such as california’s proposition 65 may impact the ability of our specialty segment to sell certain accessory products these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled products the passage of legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on our business additionally congress could enact federal legislation restricting the use of aftermarket or recycled automotive products used in the course of vehicle repairs 

the federal trade commission has issued guides that regulate the use of certain terms such as “rebuilt” or “remanufactured” in connection with the sale of automotive parts restrictions on the products we are able to sell and on the marketing of such products could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any covered major part the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on vehicle recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may discourage the use by 

such shops of recycled products there is no pending initiative to implement the parts registration from a law enforcement point of view however there is a risk that a heightened legislative concern over safety of parts might precipitate an effort to push for the implementation of such rules 

an adverse change in our relationships with our suppliers or a disruption to our supply of inventory could increase our expenses and impede our ability to serve our customers 

our north american business is dependent on a relatively small number of suppliers of aftermarket products a large portion of which are sourced from taiwan our european business also acquires product from asian sources we incur substantial freight costs to import parts from our suppliers many of which are located in asia if the cost of freight rose we might not be able to pass the cost increases on to our customers furthermore although alternative suppliers exist for substantially all aftermarket products distributed by us the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on us until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced manufacturing and providing the relevant products in addition we are subject to disruptions from work stoppages and other labor disputes at port facilities through which we import our inventory we also face the risk that our suppliers could attempt to circumvent us and sell their product directly to our customers 

moreover our operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad including among other things natural disasters transportation costs and delays political instability currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs import and export controls and other nontariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas as well as the uncertainty regarding future relations between china japan and taiwan for example us customs and border protection have used claims of intellectual property infringement to seize certain of our aftermarket parts as we attempted to import them into the us 

because a substantial volume of our sales involves products manufactured from sheet metal we can be adversely impacted if sheet metal becomes unavailable or is only available at higher prices which we may not be able to pass on to our customers additionally as oems convert to raw materials other than steel it may be more difficult or expensive to source aftermarket parts made with such materials and it may be more difficult for repair shops to work with such materials in the repair process 

most of our salvage and a portion of our self service inventory is obtained from vehicles offered at salvage auctions operated by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the us we do not typically have contracts with the auction companies according to industry analysts a small number of companies control a large percentage of the salvage auction market in the us if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions began competing with us or significantly raised its fees our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers moreover we face competition in the purchase of vehicles from direct competitors rebuilders exporters and other bidders to the extent that the number of bidders increases it may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold for wholesale recycled products some states regulate bidders to help ensure that salvage vehicles are purchased for legal purposes by qualified buyers auction companies have been actively seeking to reduce circumvent or eliminate these regulations which would further increase the number of bidders 

in addition there is a limited supply of salvage vehicles in the us as we grow and our demand for salvage vehicles increases the costs of these incremental vehicles could be higher in some states when a vehicle is deemed a total loss a salvage title is issued whether states issue salvage titles is important to the supply of inventory for the vehicle recycling industry because an increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles currently these titling issues are a matter of state law in 1992 the us congress commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle titling registration and salvage since then legislation has been introduced seeking to establish national uniform requirements in this area including a uniform definition of a salvage vehicle the vehicle recycling industry will generally favor a uniform definition since it will avoid inconsistencies across state lines and will generally favor a definition that expands the number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage however certain interest groups including repair shops and some insurance associations may oppose this type of legislation national legislation has not yet been enacted in this area and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in the future 

we also acquire inventory directly from insurance companies oems and others to the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue these arrangements our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers 

in europe we acquire products from a wide variety of suppliers as vehicle technology changes some parts will become more complex and the design or technology of those parts may be covered by patents or other rights that make it difficult for aftermarket suppliers to produce for sale to companies such as ours the complexity of the parts may include software or other technical aspects that make it difficult to identify what is wrong with the vehicle more complex parts may be difficult to repair and may require expensive or difficult to obtain software updates limiting our ability to compete with the oems 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control future factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to those listed in the special note on forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k additionally the number of selling days can fluctuate each quarter causing volatility in revenue and net income   accordingly our results of operations may not be indicative of future performance these fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below our published financial guidance and the expectations of public markets which could cause our stock price or the value of our debt instruments to decline 

our key management personnel are important to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives if we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel which could harm our business in addition to the extent wage inflation occurs in jurisdictions in which we operate we may not be able to retain key employees or we may experience increased costs 

we operate in foreign jurisdictions which exposes us to foreign exchange and other risks 

we have operations in north america europe and taiwan and we may expand our operations in the countries in which we do business and into other countries our foreign operations expose us to additional risks associated with international business which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition including import and export requirements and compliance with anticorruption laws such as the uk bribery act 2010 and the foreign corrupt practices act we also incur costs in currencies other than our functional currencies in some of the countries in which we operate we are thus subject to foreign exchange exposure to the extent that we operate in different currencies as well as exposure to foreign tax and other foreign and domestic laws in addition certain countries in which we operate have a higher level of political instability and criminal activity than the us that could affect our operations and the ability to maintain our supply of products 

if we determine that our goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired we may incur significant charges to our pretax income 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations in the future our goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of acquisitions goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses deterioration of expected future cash flows or performance increases in our cost of capital adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including modifications that restrict the activities of the acquired business as of december 31 2018  our total goodwill subject to future impairment testing was 44 billion for further discussion of our annual impairment test see goodwill impairment in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of item 7 in this annual report on form 10k 

except for indefinitelived intangibles we amortize other intangible assets over the assigned useful lives each of which is based upon the expected period to be benefited we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we review finitelived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in the event conditions change that affect our ability to realize the underlying cash flows associated with our intangible assets we may record an impairment charge as of december 31 2018   the value of our other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization was 929 million 

our business may be adversely affected by union activities and labor and employment laws  

certain of our employees are represented by labor unions and other employee representative bodies and work under collective bargaining or similar agreements which are subject to periodic renegotiation from time to time there have been efforts to organize additional portions of our workforce and those efforts can be expected to continue in addition legislators and government agencies could adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that could make it significantly easier for unionization efforts to be successful also we may in the future be subject to strikes or work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disruptions and disputes additional unionization efforts new collective bargaining or similar agreements and work stoppages could materially increase our costs and reduce revenue and could limit our flexibility in terms of work schedules reductions in force and other operational matters 

we also are subject to laws and regulations that govern such matters as minimum wage overtime and other working conditions some of these laws are technical in nature and could be subject to interpretation by government agencies and courts different than our interpretations efforts to comply with existing laws changes to such laws and newlyenacted laws may increase our labor costs and limit our flexibility if we were found not to be in compliance with such laws we could be subject to fines penalties and liabilities to our employees or government agencies in addition efforts to better protect local markets from foreign workers and decisions of countries to withdraw from treaties and joint economic areas may lead to increased restrictions on the free movement of people and labor and may limit our ability to place key personnel where it could best serve our needs 

we rely on information technology and communication systems in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business 

in the ordinary course of business we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are leased from third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans our information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals breaches due to employee error or malfeasance disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware terminations of business relationships by third party service providers power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures terrorist acts natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation any of which could adversely affect our business in addition as security threats continue to evolve we will likely need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems 

in the event that we decide to switch providers or to implement upgrades or replacements to our own systems we may be unsuccessful in the development of our own systems or we may underestimate the costs and expenses of switching providers or developing and implementing our own systems also our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system which period could extend longer than we anticipated in 2018 we launched a systems conversion project for our european businesses which will be subject to all of these risks 

the costs of complying with the requirements of laws pertaining to the privacy and security of personal information and the potential liability associated with the failure to comply with such laws could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations  

we collect personally identifiable information pii and other data as part of our business processes and operations the legislative and regulatory framework relating to privacy and data protection is rapidly evolving worldwide and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future this data is subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations many foreign countries and governmental bodies including the european union canada and other jurisdictions where we conduct business have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of pii and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions that are more restrictive than those in the us additionally the european union adopted the general data protection regulation gdpr that will impose more stringent data protection requirements for processors and controllers of personal data including expanded disclosures about how pii is to be used limitations on retention of pii mandatory data breach notification requirements and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities the gdpr became effective in may 2018 and there can be no assurance that we have timely implemented all processes required for full compliance with the regulation the gdpr provides severe penalties for noncompliance in addition stricter laws in this area are being enacted in certain states in the us and in other countries and more jurisdictions are likely to follow this trend 

any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection issues even if unfounded or comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations including at newlyacquired companies could result in additional cost and liability to us result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions give rise to civil litigation result in damage to our reputation including the loss of trust by our customers and employees inhibit sales and otherwise adversely affect our business we also may be subject to these adverse effects if other parties with whom we do business including lenders suppliers consultants and advisors violate applicable laws or contractual obligations or suffer a security breach 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our operations the function of our computer systems andor the availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in the closure of our distribution centers or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory through our system on a timely basis this may affect our ability to serve our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of 

our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the us or into the other countries in which we operate and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters  

we are subject to various environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators or lose our operating permits we could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials we have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements we cannot assure you however that we will at all times be in complete compliance with such requirements 

we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future 

under certain environmental laws we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at or migration to or from our or our predecessors past or present facilities and at independent waste disposal sites these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or was not responsible for the release of such hazardous substances many of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use that may have involved hazardous materials as a result some of our properties may be contaminated some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination these environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of treats or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties or successors to such owners or operators for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 

contamination resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release storage transportation or disposal of gasoline motor oil antifreeze transmission fluid chlorofluorocarbons cfcs from air conditioners other hazardous materials or metals such as aluminum cadmium chromium lead and mercury contamination from the refurbishment of chrome plated bumpers can occur from the release of the plating material contamination can migrate onsite or offsite which can increase the risk and the amount of any potential liability 

when we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process we analyze the risks and when appropriate perform further environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination furthermore where appropriate we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters in the event we discover new information or if laws change we may incur significant liabilities which may exceed our reserves 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we could be subject to product liability claims and involved in product recalls 

if customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage we could be subject to product liability claims by such customers the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we may become involved in the recall of a product that is determined to be defective more generally a recall involving alternative parts even if we did not sell the recalled products could adversely affect the perceived quality of alternative parts leading to decreased usage of alternative parts the expenses of a recall and the damage to our reputation or the reputation of alternative parts generally could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have agreed to defend and indemnify in certain circumstances insurance companies and customers against claims and damages relating to product liability and product recalls the existence of claims or damages for which we must defend and indemnify these parties could also negatively impact our business results of operations or financial condition 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits 

our operating subsidiaries in our salvage selfservice and refurbishing operations must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations when we develop or acquire a new facility we must seek the approval of state and local units of government governmental agencies may resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling or refurbishing facility in their communities there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold 

regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and otherwise adversely impact our business  

in august 2012 as mandated by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec adopted final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals originating from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries these requirements impose significant burdens on us public companies compliance with the rules requires substantial due diligence in an effort to determine whether products contain the conflict minerals the results of such due diligence efforts must be disclosed on an annual basis in a filing with the sec 

our supply chain is complex and we may incur significant costs to determine the source of any such minerals used in our products we may also incur costs with respect to potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of our diligence activities further the implementation of these rules and their effect on customer supplier andor consumer behavior could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering products free of conflict minerals in some circumstances we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary products from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflictfree or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement accordingly these rules could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition 

if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks and other vehicles our business could be harmed 

we use a fleet of trucks and other vehicles to deliver the majority of the products we sell we are subject to the risks associated with providing delivery services including inclement weather disruptions in the transportation infrastructure governmental regulation availability and price of fuel liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance and insurance premium increases in addition our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may lose the right to operate at key locations 

we lease most of the properties at which we conduct our businesses at the end of a lease term we must negotiate a renewal exercise a purchase option to the extent we have that right or find a new location there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate renewals on terms acceptable to us or that we will find a suitable alternative location especially with respect to our salvage operations which have characteristics that are often not attractive to landlords local governments or neighbors in such cases we may lose the right to operate at key locations 

our effective tax rate could materially increase as a consequence of various factors including interpretations and administrative guidance in regard to the tax act defined below us andor international tax legislation mix of earnings by jurisdiction and us and foreign jurisdictional audits 

we are a us based multinational company subject to income taxes in the us and a number of foreign jurisdictions therefore we are subject to changes in tax laws in each of these jurisdictions and such changes could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate and cash flows 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act among other things the tax act reduced the us statutory corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 additionally beginning in 2018 the tax act imposed a regime of taxation on foreign subsidiary earnings global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” and on certain related party payments base erosion antiabuse tax “beat” other important changes potentially material to our operations included the full expensing of certain assets placed into service after september 27 2017 the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction and additional limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation finally as part of the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system the tax act imposed a onetime transition tax on the deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 other than the transition tax and revaluation of deferred tax balances which were applicable to us for 2017 the provisions will generally be applicable in 2018 and beyond in accordance with the guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded provisional reasonable estimates of the impact of the tax act including 51 million for the transition tax and a deferred tax 

benefit of 73 million related to the revaluation of deferred tax balances based on the new rate during the third quarter of 2018 we recorded a 10 million favorable adjustment to the provisional amount recognized in 2017 related to the transition tax no further material adjustments were recognized with regard to the revaluation of deferred tax balances as of december 31 2018 we completed our analysis of the impact of the tax act in accordance with sab 118 and the provisional amounts recognized in 2017 are no longer considered provisional 

certain nonus jurisdictions are considering tax legislation based upon recommendations made by the organization for economic cooperation and development in connection with its base erosion and profit shifting study the outcome of these legislative developments could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate and cash flows 

the tax rates applicable in the jurisdictions within which we operate vary widely therefore our effective tax rate may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of our earnings by jurisdiction 

we are also subject to ongoing audits of our income tax returns in various jurisdictions both in the us and internationally while we believe that our tax positions will be sustained the outcomes of such audits could result in the assessment of additional taxes which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results 

if significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on products or materials we import or any related countermeasures are taken by countries to which we export products our revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed  

the current us administration has recently imposed tariffs on certain materials imported into the us from china and announced additional tariffs on other goods from china and other countries moreover countermeasures have been taken by other countries in retaliation for the usimposed tariffs the tariffs cover products and materials that we import and the countermeasures may affect products we export the effects currently are not material however depending on the breadth of products and materials ultimately affected by and the duration of the tariffs and countermeasures our financial results may be materially harmed in addition countries may impose other restrictions on the importation of products for example china has imposed a ban on the importation of 32 types of solid waste allegedly in an effort to reduce environmental pollution this ban includes certain scrap metals that we sell and will likely have the effect of reducing the prices of such products 

activist investors could cause us to incur substantial costs divert management’s attention and have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to proposals by activist investors urging us to take certain corporate actions if activist investor activities occur our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and other demands by activist investors can be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees for example we may be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist investor matters including legal financial and communications advisors the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results campaigns by activist investors to effect changes at publiclytraded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short term investor value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company perceived uncertainties as to our future direction strategy or leadership that arise as a consequence of activist investor initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities harm our ability to attract new investors employees and business partners and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation 

risks relating to our common stock and financial structure 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline additionally the market price for our common stock has been in the past and in the future may be adversely affected by allegations made or reports issued by short sellers analysts activists or others regarding our business model our management or our financial accounting 

following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

delaware law our charter documents and our loan documents may impede or discourage a takeover which could affect the price of our stock 

the antitakeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws our loan documents and delaware law could together or separately impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult our credit agreement provides that a change of control is an event of default our incorporation under delaware law and these provisions could also impede an acquisition takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the price of our common stock 

future sales of our common stock or other securities may depress our stock price 

we and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock or other equity debt or instruments that constitute an element of our debt and equity collectively securities in the future we may also issue shares of common stock under our equity incentive plan or in connection with future acquisitions we cannot predict the size of future issuances of securities or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock or other securities will have on the price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued in connection with an acquisition the issuance of additional debt securities or the perception that such sales or issuances could occur may cause the price of our common stock to fall 

we cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented 

in october 2018 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program totaling 500 million we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares and our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to react to changes in our business 

as of december 31 2018    we had approximately 18 billion  aggregate principal amount of secured debt outstanding and approximately 17 billion of availability under our credit agreement  18 billion  of availability reduced by 65 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit in addition we had approximately 23 billion  aggregate principal amount of unsecured debt outstanding comprising 600 million aggregate principal amount of 475 senior notes due may 15 2023  the us notes 2023 €500 million 573 million aggregate principal amount of 3875 senior notes due april 1 2024 the euro notes 2024 and €10 billion 11 billion aggregate principal amount consisting of €750 million of 3625 senior notes due 2026 the euro notes 2026 and €250 million of 4125 senior notes due 2028 the euro notes 2028 together with the 2026 notes the euro notes 202628 and together with the us notes 2023 euro notes 2024 and euro notes 2026 the senior notes borrowings under the credit agreement mature in january 2024 

our significant amount of debt and our debt service obligations could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations limit our ability to operate our business and impair our competitive position 

for example our debt and our debt service obligations could 

 in addition if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the ability to service such debt would increase 

our senior notes do not impose any limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or protect against certain other types of transactions 

although we are subject to our credit agreement for so long as it remains in effect the indentures governing the senior notes do not restrict the future incurrence of unsecured indebtedness guarantees or other obligations the indentures contain certain limitations on our ability to incur liens on assets and engage in sale and leaseback transactions however these limitations are subject to important exceptions in addition the indentures do not contain many other restrictions including certain restrictions contained in our credit agreement including without limitation making investments prepaying subordinated indebtedness or engaging in transactions with our affiliates 

our credit agreement will permit subject to specified conditions and limitations the incurrence of a significant amount of additional indebtedness as of december 31 2018  we would have been able to incur an additional 17 billion of indebtedness under our credit agreement  18 billion  of availability reduced by 65 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the ability to service such debt would increase 

our credit agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

our credit agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability among other things to 

 as a result of these covenants and restrictions we will be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit agreement a default if not waived could result in acceleration of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing credit facilities or it may be on terms that are not acceptable to us 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we hope to realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due any future refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations additionally our credit agreement and the indentures that govern our senior notes limit the use of the proceeds from certain 

dispositions of our assets as a result our credit agreement and our senior notes may prevent us from using the proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all of our debt service obligations 

our future capital needs may require that we seek to refinance our debt or obtain additional debt or equity financing events that could have a negative effect on our business 

we may need to raise additional funds in the future to among other things refinance existing debt fund our existing operations improve or expand our operations respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions from time to time we may raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic alliances or other arrangements funds may not be available or available on terms acceptable to us as a result of different factors including but not limited to turmoil in the credit markets that results in the tightening of credit conditions and current or future regulations applicable to the financial institutions from whom we seek financing if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of our common stock if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and further limitations on our operations if we refinance or restructure our debt we may incur charges to write off the unamortized portion of deferred debt issuance costs from a previous financing or we may incur charges related to hedge ineffectiveness from our interest rate swap obligations there are restrictions in the indenture that governs the euro notes 2024 euro notes 2026 and euro notes 2028 on our ability to refinance such notes prior to january 1 2024 april 1 2021 and april 1 2023 respectively if we fail to raise capital when needed our business may be negatively affected 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly and could affect the value of our senior notes 

certain borrowings under our credit agreement and the borrowing under our accounts receivable securitization facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness would correspondingly decrease moreover changes in market interest rates could affect the trading value of the senior notes certain of our variable rate debt including our revolving credit facility currently uses the london interbank offered rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate libor is the subject of recent proposals for reform these reforms and other pressures may cause libor to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past the consequences of these developments with respect to libor cannot be entirely predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt assuming all revolving loans were fully drawn and no interest rate swaps were in place each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in a 36 million  change in annual cash interest expense under our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization facility 

repayment of our indebtedness including our senior notes is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries 

we are a holding company and repayment of our senior notes will be dependent upon cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are borrowers or guarantors of the indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness including the senior notes each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries and under certain circumstances distributions from our subsidiaries may be subject to taxes that reduce the amount of such distributions available to us while the indentures governing the senior notes limit the ability of our subsidiaries to restrict the payment of dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness including the senior notes 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our senior notes 

credit ratings have an important effect on our cost of capital credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include among other items our results of operations business decisions that we make their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading we believe our current credit ratings enhance our ability to borrow funds at favorable rates a downgrade in our current credit rating from a rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facilities a downgrade could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our senior notes preventing a holder from selling the senior notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affecting our ability to issue new notes in the future or incur other indebtedness upon favorable terms 

the right to receive payments on the senior notes is effectively junior to those lenders who have a security interest in our assets 

our obligations under our senior notes and our guarantors’ obligations under their guarantees of the senior notes are unsecured but our and each coborrower’s obligations under our credit agreement and each guarantor’s obligations under their respective guarantees of the credit agreement are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our domestic tangible and intangible assets including the stock of most of our whollyowned united states subsidiaries and the stock of certain of our nonunited states subsidiaries if we are declared bankrupt or insolvent or if we default under our credit agreement the lenders could declare all of the funds borrowed thereunder together with accrued interest immediately due and payable if we were unable to repay such indebtedness the lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets to the exclusion of holders of our senior notes even if an event of default exists under the applicable indenture governing the senior notes furthermore if the lenders foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any subsidiary guarantor under our senior notes then that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the senior notes automatically and immediately upon such sale in any such event because the senior notes are not secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in subsidiary guarantors it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from which claims by holders of the senior notes could be satisfied or if any assets remained they might be insufficient to satisfy claims fully as of december 31 2018    we had approximately 18 billion  aggregate principal amount of secured debt outstanding and approximately 17 billion of availability under the credit agreement  18 billion  of availability reduced by 65 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit 

united states federal and state statutes allow courts under specific circumstances to void the senior notes   and the guarantees subordinate claims in respect of the senior notes and the guarantees and require holders of the senior notes to return payments received from us or the guarantors 

our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that are obligors under the credit agreement guarantee the obligations under our senior notes in addition certain subsidiaries of the issuer of the euro notes 2024 guarantee the obligations under the euro notes 2024 the issuance of our senior notes and the issuance of the guarantees by the guarantors may be subject to review under state and federal laws if a bankruptcy liquidation or reorganization case or a lawsuit including in circumstances in which bankruptcy is not involved were commenced at some future date by or on behalf of our unpaid creditors or the unpaid creditors of a guarantor under the federal bankruptcy laws of the united states and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws a court may avoid or otherwise decline to enforce the senior notes or a guarantor’s guarantee or may subordinate the senior notes or such guarantee to our or the applicable guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness while the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction a court might do so if it found that when indebtedness under the senior notes was issued or when the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee or in some jurisdictions when payments became due under the senior notes or such guarantee the issuer or the applicable guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and 

 a court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the senior notes or such guarantee if we or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the senior notes thus if the guarantees were legally challenged any guarantee could be subject to the claim that since the guarantee was incurred for our benefit and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration if a court were to void the issuance of the senior notes or any guarantee a holder of the senior notes would no longer have any claim against us or the applicable guarantor in the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred a holder of the senior notes may not receive any repayment on the senior notes further the avoidance of the senior notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt which could result in acceleration of that debt the measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred generally however an issuer or a guarantor as applicable would be considered insolvent if 

 a court might also void the senior notes or a guarantee without regard to the above factors if the court found that the senior notes were incurred or issued or the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee with actual intent to hinder delay or defraud its creditors we cannot give any assurance as to what standard a court would apply in determining whether we or the 

guarantors were solvent at the relevant time or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard or regardless of the standard that a court uses that it would not determine that we or a guarantor were indeed insolvent on that date that any payments to the holders of the senior notes including under the guarantees did not constitute preferences fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds or that the issuance of the senior notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to our or any guarantor’s other debt in addition any payment by us or a guarantor pursuant to the senior notes or its guarantee could be avoided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors and accordingly the court might direct holders of the senior notes to repay any amounts already received from us or such guarantor among other things under us bankruptcy law any payment by us pursuant to the senior notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time we or such guarantor were found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a oneyear period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside party and such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such party would have received in a distribution under the bankruptcy code in a hypothetical chapter 7 case although each guarantee contains a “savings clause” intended to limit the subsidiary guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its subsidiary guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer this provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect any subsidiary guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law in that regard in official committee of unsecured creditors of   tousa inc v citicorp north america inc  the united states bankruptcy court in the southern district of florida held that a savings clause similar to the savings clause included in our indentures was unenforceable as a result the subsidiary guarantees were found to be fraudulent conveyances the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit subsequently affirmed the liability findings of the bankruptcy court without ruling directly on the enforceability of savings clauses generally if the decision of the bankruptcy court in tousa  were followed by other courts the risk that the guarantees would be deemed fraudulent conveyances would be significantly increased 

to the extent a court avoids the senior notes or any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or holds the senior notes or any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason the holders of the senior notes would cease to have any direct claim against us or the applicable guarantor if a court were to take this action our or the applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy our or the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities if any and might not be applied to the payment of the senior notes sufficient funds to repay the senior notes may not be available from other sources including the remaining guarantors if any in addition the euro notes 2024 and the guarantees may be subject to avoidance under the laws of other foreign jurisdictions including italy and czech republic to the extent that we the issuer of the euro notes 2024 or any of the guarantors as applicable were to be the subject of an insolvency or related proceeding in such jurisdictions 

not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our credit agreement or our senior notes and the assets of our nonguarantor subsidiaries may not be available to make payments on such obligations 

not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the credit agreement our us notes 2023 euro notes 2024 euro notes 2026 and euro notes 2028 in the event that any nonguarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent liquidates reorganizes dissolves or otherwise winds up holders of its indebtedness and its trade creditors generally will be entitled to payment on their claims from the assets of that subsidiary before any of those assets are made available to the lenders under the credit agreement or the holders of the senior notes consequently claims in respect of the credit agreement and the senior notes are structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors of such instruments including trade payables and any claims of third party holders of preferred equity interests if any in our nonguarantor subsidiaries for the year ended december 31 2018  our subsidiaries that are not borrowers under or do not guarantee the credit agreement and our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the us notes 2023 represented approximately 49 and 30 of our total revenue and operating income respectively in addition these nonguarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 58 and 60 of our total assets and total liabilities respectively as of december 31 2018  excluding in each case intercompany amounts as of the same date our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the credit agreement or the us notes 2023 had approximately 27 billion of outstanding indebtedness which includes 683 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities by foreign subsidiaries that are borrowers under the revolving credit facilities but that do not guarantee the us notes 2023 the group of subsidiaries that does not guarantee the euro notes 2024 is similar to the group that does not guarantee the us notes 2023 euro notes 2026 and euro notes 2028 except that in addition to the issuer of the euro notes 2024 there are four subsidiaries in the group that does not guarantee the us notes 2023 euro notes 2026 and euro notes 2028 that guarantee the euro notes 2024 

we may not be able to repurchase the senior notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer 

upon a change of control as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes the holders of the senior notes will have the right to require us to offer to purchase all of the senior notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest such a change of control would also be an event of default under our credit agreement in order to obtain sufficient funds to pay amounts due under the credit agreement and the purchase price of the outstanding senior notes we expect that we would have to refinance our indebtedness we cannot assure you that we would be 

able to refinance our indebtedness on reasonable terms if at all our failure to offer to purchase all outstanding senior notes or to purchase all validly tendered senior notes would be an event of default under the indenture such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other debt our other debt also may contain restrictions on repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture 

the definition of change of control in the indentures governing the senior notes includes a phrase relating to the sale of “all or substantially all” of our assets there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law accordingly the ability of a holder of senior notes to require us to repurchase its senior notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain 

in addition in certain circumstances as specified in the indentures governing the senior notes we will be required to commence an asset sale offer as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes pursuant to which we will be obligated to purchase certain senior notes at a price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest with the proceeds we receive from certain asset sales our other debt may contain restrictions that would limit or prohibit us from completing any such asset sale offer in particular our credit agreement contains provisions that require us upon the sale of certain assets to apply all of the proceeds from such asset sale to the prepayment of amounts due under the credit agreement the mandatory prepayment obligations under the credit agreement will be effectively senior to our obligations to make an asset sale offer with respect to the senior notes under the terms of the indentures governing the senior notes our failure to purchase any such senior notes when required under the indentures would be an event of default under the indentures 

key terms of the senior notes will be suspended if the notes achieve investment grade ratings and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing 

many of the covenants in the indentures governing the senior notes will be suspended if the senior notes are rated investment grade by standard  poor’s and moody’s provided at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing including those covenants that restrict among other things our ability to pay dividends incur liens and to enter into certain other transactions there can be no assurance that the senior notes will ever be rated investment grade however suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force although provisions under our other debt like the credit agreement may continue to restrict us from engaging in these transactions and the effects of any such transactions will be permitted to remain in place even if the senior notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade 

the liquidity and market value of the senior notes may change due to a variety of factors 

the liquidity of any trading market in the senior notes and the market price quoted for the senior notes may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for these types of securities changes in interest rates changes in our ratings and changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industries generally 

we rely on an accounts receivable securitization program for a portion of our liquidity 

we have an arrangement whereby we sell an interest in a portion of our accounts receivable to a special purpose vehicle and receive funding through the commercial paper market this arrangement expires in november 2021 in the event that the market for commercial paper were to close or otherwise become constrained our cost of credit relative to this program could rise or credit could be unavailable altogether

sources of revenue 

we report our revenue in two categories i parts and services and ii other our parts revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products including replacement parts components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty products and accessories to improve the performance functionality and appearance of vehicles our service revenue is generated primarily from the sale of servicetype warranties fees for admission to our self service yards and processing fees related to the secure disposal of vehicles during the year ended december 31 2018 parts and services revenue represented approximately 95 of our consolidated revenue revenue from other sources includes scrap sales bulk sales to mechanical manufacturers including cores and sales of aluminum ingots and sows from our furnace operations other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold see note 5 revenue recognition  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information related to our sources of revenue 

selling general and administrative expenses 

in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2017 we reported the following categories of operating expenses i facility and warehouse expenses ii distribution expenses and iii selling general and administrative expenses to better reflect the changing profile of our business and to align our financial statement presentation with other automotive parts and distribution companies beginning with our quarterly report on form 10q for the three months ended march 31 2018 these three categories have been consolidated into one line item selling general and administrative sga expenses 

other than the consolidation of these financial statement line items and the changes due to the adoptions of accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asu 201409 and asu 201707  improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost  as discussed in note 4 financial statement information to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k there have been no changes to the classification of revenue or expenses on our consolidated statements of income our sga expenses continue to include personnel costs for employees in selling general and administrative functions costs to operate our selling locations corporate offices and back office support centers costs to transport our products from our facilities to our customers and other selling general and administrative expenses such as professional fees supplies and advertising expenses 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition inventory valuation business combinations and goodwill impairment we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue actual results may differ from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu 201409 this update outlines a new comprehensive revenue recognition model that supersedes the prior revenue recognition guidance and requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the fasb has issued several updates to asu 

201409 which collectively with asu 201409 represent the fasb accounting standards codification topic 606 “asc 606” on january 1 2018 we adopted asc 606 for all contracts using the modified retrospective method for more information regarding the adoption of the new revenue standard as well as our critical accounting policies related to revenue refer to note 5 revenue recognition to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

inventory accounting 

salvage and remanufactured inventory  our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle including auction towing and storage fees as well as expenditures for buying and dismantling vehicles inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facilitys inventory at expected selling prices the assessment of which incorporates the sales probability based on a parts days in stock and historical demand the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facilitys historical profitability for salvage vehicles remanufactured inventory cost is based upon the price paid for cores and also includes expenses incurred for freight direct manufacturing costs and overhead related to our remanufacturing operations 

all inventory  for all inventory carrying value is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value and is reduced to reflect current anticipated demand if actual demand differs from our estimates additional reductions to inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made 

business combinations 

we record our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values we utilize management estimates and in some instances independent thirdparty valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and contingent consideration granted there are inherent assumptions and estimates used in developing the future cash flows and fair values of tangible and intangible assets such as projecting revenues and profits discount rates income tax rates royalty rates customer attrition rates and other various valuation assumptions we use various valuation methods to value property plant and equipment when valuing real property we typically use the sales comparison approach for land and the income approach for buildings and building improvements when valuing personal property we typically use either the income or cost approach we used the relieffromroyalty method to value trade names trademarks software and other technology assets and we used the multiperiod excess earnings method to value customer relationships the relieffromroyalty method assumes that the intangible asset has value to the extent that its owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the intangible asset the multiperiod excess earnings method is based on the present value of the incremental aftertax cash flows attributable only to the customer relationship after deducting contributory asset charges 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles impairment 

we are required to test our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually when testing goodwill for impairment we are required to evaluate events and circumstances that may affect the performance of the reporting unit and the extent to which the events and circumstances may impact the future cash flows of the reporting unit to determine whether the fair value of the assets exceed the carrying value developing the estimated future cash flows and fair value of the reporting unit requires managements judgment in projecting revenues and profits allocation of shared corporate costs tax rates capital expenditures working capital requirements discount rates and market multiples many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates can change in future periods if these assumptions or estimates change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill 

we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist  during   2018  we did not identify any events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts therefore we did not perform any impairment tests other than our annual test in the fourth quarter of   2018   as of october 31 

our goodwill impairment assessment is performed by reporting unit a reporting unit is an operating segment or a business one level below an operating segment the component level for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management however components are aggregated as a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics for the purpose of aggregating our components into reporting units we review the longterm performance of segment ebitda additionally we review qualitative factors such as type or class of customers nature of products distribution methods inventory procurement methods level of integration and interdependency of processes across 

components our assessment of the aggregation includes both qualitative and quantitative factors and is based on the facts and circumstances specific to the components 

we have four  operating segments wholesale – north america europe specialty and self service each of these operating segments consists of multiple components that have discrete financial information available that is reviewed by segment management on a regular basis we have evaluated these components and concluded that the components that compose the europe specialty and self service operating segments are economically similar and thus were aggregated into three separate reporting units based on our aggregation assessment of the qualitative and quantitative factors of the components of the wholesale – north america operating segment we determined the aviation component should not be aggregated with its operating segment wholesale – north america thus we did not aggregate the aviation component into the wholesale – north america reporting unit our aviation reporting unit resulted from a 2017 acquisition of a small wholesale business in north america as of the date of our 2018 annual goodwill impairment test we were organized into five reporting units wholesale  north america europe specialty self service and aviation 

our goodwill would be considered impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value the fair value estimates are established using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach we believe that using two methods to determine fair value limits the chances of an unrepresentative valuation discount rates growth rates and cash flow projections are the assumptions that are most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses increases in our cost of capital adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including modifications that restrict the activities of the acquired business to assess the reasonableness of the fair value estimates we compare the sum of the reporting units’ fair values to the company’s market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium which is then evaluated against recent market transactions in our industry if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results 

based on our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2018 we determined the carrying value of our aviation reporting unit exceeded the fair value estimate by more than the carrying value thus we recorded an impairment charge of 33 million which represented the total carrying value of goodwill in our aviation reporting unit the impairment charge was due to a decrease in the fair value estimate from the prior year fair value estimate primarily driven by a significant deterioration in the outlook for the aviation reporting unit due to competition customer financial issues and changing market conditions for the airplane platforms that the business services which lowered our projected gross margin and related future cash flows we reported the impairment charge in impairment of goodwill on the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2018 we determined no other impairments existed when we performed our annual impairment testing on the remaining four reporting units as all those reporting units had a fair value estimate which exceeded the carrying value by at least approximately 15 the level at which our europe reporting unit exceeded its carrying value the excess of the fair value estimate over the carrying value for our europe reporting unit decreased from our 2017 to our 2018 impairment test as a result of the stahlgruber acquisition in may 2018 this decrease aligns with our expectations as there has not been a significant change in the value of the stahlgruber business since its acquisition which had the effect of reducing the excess for the entire europe reporting unit as of december 31 2018  we had a total of 44 billion  in goodwill subject to future impairment tests 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we performed a quantitative impairment test   in the fourth quarter of   2018   as of october 31 using the relieffromroyalty method to value the warn trademark which is our only indefinitelived intangible w e determined no impairment existed as the trademark had a fair value estimate which exceeded the carrying value

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes liquidity data as of the dates indicated in thousands 

 we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through both internal development and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our credit facilities we utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures with the excess amounts going towards funding acquisitions or paying down outstanding debt as we have pursued acquisitions as part of our growth strategy our cash flows from operations have not always been sufficient to cover our investing activities to fund our acquisitions we have accessed various forms of debt financing including revolving credit facilities senior notes and our receivables securitization facility 

as of december 31 2018  we had debt outstanding and additional available sources of financing as follows 

 from time to time we may undertake financing transactions to increase our available liquidity such as i our november 2018 amendment to our senior secured credit facility and ii the issuance of the euro notes 202628 in april 2018 related to the stahlgruber acquisition given the longterm nature of our investment in stahlgruber combined with favorable interest rates we decided to fund the acquisition primarily through longterm fixed rate notes we believe this approach provides financial flexibility to execute our longterm growth strategy while maintaining availability under our revolver if we see an attractive acquisition opportunity we have the ability to use our revolver to move quickly and have certainty of funding up to the amount of our thenavailable liquidity 

the enterprise value for the stahlgruber acquisition was €15 billion which was financed with the proceeds from the €10 billion of euro notes 202628 the direct issuance to stahlgrubers owner of 8055569 newly issued shares of lkq common stock and borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 17 billion available under our credit facilities combined with approximately 332 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2018  we had approximately 20 billion in available liquidity an increase  of 355 million  over our available liquidity as of december 31 2017  

we believe that our current liquidity and cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements although such sources may not be sufficient for future acquisitions depending on their size while we believe that we have adequate capacity from time to time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements as noted above regarding the stahlgruber transaction there can be no assurance that additional funding or refinancing of our credit facilities if needed will be available on terms attractive to us or at all furthermore any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants or higher interest costs our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at variable rates which are tied to the libor or the canadian dollar offered rate cdor depending on the currency and the duration of the borrowing plus an applicable margin rate 

which is subject to change quarterly based on our reported leverage ratio we hold interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates on a portion of our credit agreement borrowings with the effect of fixing the interest rates on the respective notional amounts in addition in 2016 and 2018 we entered into cross currency swaps that contain an interest rate swap component and a foreign currency forward contract component that when combined with related intercompany financing arrangements effectively convert variable rate us dollardenominated borrowings into fixed rate eurodenominated borrowings these derivative transactions are described in note 11 derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k after giving effect to these contracts the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2018  was 19  including our senior notes and the borrowings under our receivables securitization program our overall weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 31  at december 31 2018  

cash interest payments were 138 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  including 52 million  in semiannual interest payments on our us notes 2023 and our euro notes 2024 interest payments on our us notes 2023 are made in may and november and interest payments on our euro notes 2024 are scheduled for april and october beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018 we began making semiannual interest payments of 22 million on our euro notes 202628 interest payments on our euro notes 202628 are made in april and october 

we had outstanding credit agreement borrowings of 17 billion  and 20 billion  at december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  respectively of these amounts 9 million  and 18 million  was classified as current maturities at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

the scheduled maturities of longterm obligations outstanding at december 31 2018  are as follows in thousands 



 our credit agreement contains customary covenants that provide limitations and conditions on our ability to enter into certain transactions the credit agreement also contains financial and affirmative covenants including limitations on our net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our credit agreement as of december 31 2018  

  

the following summarizes our required debt covenants and our actual ratios with respect to those covenants as calculated per the credit agreement as of december 31 2018 



the terms net leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio used in the credit agreement are specifically calculated per the credit agreement and differ in specified ways from comparable gaap or common usage terms 

as of december 31 2018  the company had cash and cash equivalents of 332 million  of which 274 million  was held by foreign subsidiaries in general it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and that position has not changed following the enactment of the tax act and the related imposition of the transition tax distributions of dividends from our foreign subsidiaries if any would be generally exempt from further us taxation either as a result of the new 100 participation exemption under the tax act or due to the previous taxation of 

foreign earnings under the transition tax in july 2018 to lower our average borrowing cost we elected to unwind several financing entities in europe restructure and increase related europe borrowings and repatriate cash to reduce us borrowings 

we believe that we have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our financial obligations in the us without repatriating our foreign earnings we may from time to time choose to selectively repatriate foreign earnings if doing so supports our financing or liquidity objectives as a result of the tax act we had significantly lower income tax payments in 2018 due to the lower tax rate and the immediate deduction of capital expenditures partially offset by the first payment with respect to the transition tax 

year ended december 31 2018 compared to year ended december 31 2017 

the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds we normally pay for aftermarket product purchases at the time of shipment or on standard payment terms depending on the manufacturer and the negotiated payment terms we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles

 net cash used in investing activities totaled 15 billion  for the year ended   december 31 2018  compared to 385 million  of cash used in investing activities during the year ended   december 31 2017  we invested 12 billion  of cash net of cash acquired in business acquisitions during the year ended   december 31 2018  compared to 513 million  during the year ended   december 31 2017  we received net proceeds from the sale of our glass manufacturing business totaling 301 million  during the year ended   december 31 2017  no such proceeds were received in 2018 property plant and equipment purchases were 250 million  in 2018 compared to 179 million  in the prior year the period over period increase in cash outflows for purchases of property plant and equipment was primarily related to our north america and europe segments we had 28 million of proceeds from the disposals of property plant and equipment in 2018 compared to 9 million in the prior year the increase was primarily related to our north america segment we invested 60 million in unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2018 compared to 8 million in the prior year primarily due to the 48 million mekonomen rights issue in the fourth quarter of 2018 there was no rights offering in 2017 during the year ended december 31 2018 we received 37 million of deferred purchase price proceeds on receivables under our factoring arrangement that was acquired in our stahlgruber acquisition no such proceeds were received in 2017 the arrangement was subsequently terminated in december 2018 

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 883 million  for the year ended   december 31 2018  compared to net cash used in financing activities of 113 million  during the year ended   december 31 2017  we received proceeds of 12 billion  from our issuance of the euro notes 202628 during the year ended   december 31 2018  no such proceeds were received in the prior year we repurchased 60 million of our common stock during 2018 following the board of directors authorization of a stock repurchase program in october 2018 we did not repurchase any common stock during 2017 we also paid 21 million  of debt issuance costs during 2018  primarily related to the issuance of the euro notes 202628 compared to 4 million paid during 2017 in connection with our december 2017 amendment of our credit facilities during the year ended   december 31 2018  net repayments under our credit facilities totaled 206 million  compared to 135 million  during the year ended   december 31 2017  there were 12 million of cash repayments of other debt in 2018  compared to 20 million  of cash proceeds from other debt in 2017  there was 42 million of cash paid for stahlgrubers assumed debt that matured in 2018 and 13 million of cash paid for notes issued related to our acquisitions of an aftermarket parts distribution businesses in belgium in the third quarter of 2017 

during the year ended   december 31 2018  foreign exchange rates decreased cash cash equivalents and restricted cash by 77 million  compared to an increase of 24 million  in the prior year the current year impact was primarily related to a 66 million  decrease resulting from the decline in the euro exchange rate between april 9 2018 the date we received the proceeds from the euro notes 202628 and may 30 2018 the date we paid the cash proceeds for the stahlgruber acquisition 

we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of distribution centers processing and sales facilities and warehouses through further integration of our facilities and through selected business acquisitions our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in 

 foreign exchange rates 

foreign currency fluctuations may impact the financial results we report for the portions of our business that operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar our operations outside of the us represented 479 and 418 of our revenue during 2018  and 2017  respectively an increase or decrease in the strength of the us dollar against these currencies by 10 would result in a 48 change in our consolidated revenue and a 29 change in our operating income for the year ended   december 31 2018  see our results of operations discussion in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our year over year results 

additionally we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket products from foreign countries primarily in europe and asia to the extent that our inventory purchases are not denominated in the functional currency of the purchasing location we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in several of our operations we purchase inventory from manufacturers in taiwan in us dollars which exposes us to fluctuations in the relationship between the local functional currency and the us dollar as well as fluctuations between the us dollar and the taiwan dollar we hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations related to a portion of inventory purchases in our europe operations but the notional amount and fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2018 were immaterial we do not currently attempt to hedge foreign currency exposure related to our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in our north america operations and we may not be able to pass on any resulting price increases to our customers 

other than with respect to a portion of our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases we do not hold derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency risk our net investment in foreign operations is partially hedged by the foreign currency denominated borrowings we use to fund foreign acquisitions however our ability to use foreign currency denominated borrowings to finance our foreign operations may be limited based on local tax laws we have elected not to hedge the foreign currency risk related to the interest payments on foreign borrowings as we generate cash flows in the local currencies that can be used to fund debt payments as of december 31 2018  we had outstanding borrowings of €500 million under our euro notes 2024 €10 billion under our euro notes 202628 and £290 million €163 million cad 130 million and sek 275 million under our revolving credit facilities as of december 31 2017  we had outstanding borrowings of €500 million under our euro notes 2024 and £124 million cad 130 million sek 250 million and €132 million under our 

revolving credit facilities the interest payments on our €10 billion euro notes 202628 are funded primarily by cash flows generated by stahlgruber 

interest rates 

our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facilities where interest rates are tied to the prime rate libor or cdor therefore we implemented a policy to manage our exposure to variable interest rates on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt instruments through the use of interest rate swap contracts these contracts convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt matching the currency effective dates and maturity dates to specific debt instruments net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swap contracts are included as adjustments to interest expense all of our interest rate swap contracts have been executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy wells fargo bank na bank of america na citizens na hsbc bank usa na and banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria sa 

as of december 31 2018  we held eight interest rate swap contracts representing a total of 480 million  of us dollardenominated notional amount debt our interest rate swap contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and modify the variable rate nature of that portion of our variable rate debt these swaps have maturity dates ranging from january 2021 through june 2021 as of december 31 2018  the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was an asset of 15 million  the values of such contracts are subject to changes in interest rates 

in addition to these interest rate swaps as of december 31 2018  we held five cross currency swap agreements for a total notional amount of 574 million €530 million with maturity dates in october 2019 october 2020 and january 2021 these cross currency swaps contain an interest rate swap component and a foreign currency forward contract component that combined with related intercompany financing arrangements effectively convert variable rate us dollardenominated borrowings into fixed rate eurodenominated borrowings the swaps are intended to reduce uncertainty in cash flows in us dollars and euros in connection with intercompany financing arrangements the cross currency swaps were also executed with banks we believe are creditworthy wells fargo bank na bank of america na mufg bank ltd mufg formerly known as the bank of tokyomitsubishi ufj ltd and suntrust bank as of december 31 2018  the fair value of the interest rate swap components of the cross currency swaps was an asset of 7 million and a liability of 1 million and the fair value of the foreign currency forward components was an asset of 1 million and a liability of 40 million the values of these contracts are subject to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in total we had 57 of our variable rate debt under our credit facilities at fixed rates at december 31 2018  compared to 48 at december 31 2017  see note 10 longterm obligations  and note 11 derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

at december 31 2018  we had approximately  793 million  of variable rate debt that was not hedged using sensitivity analysis a 100 basis point movement in interest rates would change interest expense by 8 million  over the next twelve months 

commodity prices 

we are exposed to market risk related to price fluctuations in scrap metal and other metals market prices of these metals affect the amount that we pay for our inventory and the revenue that we generate from sales of these metals as both our revenue and costs are affected by the price fluctuations we have a natural hedge against the changes however there is typically a lag between the effect on our revenue from metal price fluctuations and inventory cost changes and there is no guarantee that the vehicle costs will decrease or increase at the same rate as the metals prices therefore we can experience positive or negative gross margin effects in periods of rising or falling metals prices particularly when such prices move rapidly additionally if market prices were to change at a greater rate than our vehicle acquisition costs we could experience a positive or negative effect on our operating margin the average of scrap metal prices for 2018  has increased 18 over the average for 2017

 item 1   business 

overview 

lkq corporation lkq or the company is a global distributor of vehicle products including replacement parts components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty products and accessories to improve the performance functionality and appearance of vehicles 

buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers oems new products produced by companies other than the oems which are referred to as aftermarket products recycled products obtained from salvage vehicles used products that have been refurbished and used products that have been remanufactured collectively we refer to the four sources that are not new oem products as alternative parts we distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops including aftermarket collision and mechanical products recycled collision and mechanical products refurbished collision products such as wheels bumper covers and lights and remanufactured engines and transmissions 

we are a leading provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products with our sales processing and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the united states and canada we are also a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement and maintenance products in the united kingdom the benelux region belgium netherlands and luxembourg italy czech republic switzerland and other eastern european countries in addition to our wholesale operations we operate self service retail facilities across the us that sell recycled automotive products from endoflife vehicles we are also a leading distributor of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories reaching most major markets in the us and canada 

we are organized into four operating segments wholesale  north america europe specialty and self service we aggregate our wholesale  north america and self service operating segments into one reportable segment north america resulting in three reportable segments north america europe and specialty see note 14 segment and geographic information to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for financial information by reportable segment and by geographic region 

history 

we were initially formed in 1998 through the combination of a number of wholesale recycled products businesses located in florida michigan ohio and wisconsin we subsequently expanded through internal development and approximately 260 acquisitions of aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured product suppliers and manufacturers self service retail businesses and specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories suppliers our most significant acquisitions include 



further information regarding our recent acquisitions is included in note 2 business combinations to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

strategy 

our mission is to be the leading global valueadded distributor of vehicle parts and accessories by offering our customers the most comprehensive available and costeffective selection of part solutions while building strong partnerships with our employees and the communities in which we operate 

we have four primary pillars of a strategy to build economic value growth through diversified product offerings growth through geographic expansion adaptation to evolving technology and rationalization of our asset base to enhance margins and return of capital we believe our supply network with a broad inventory of quality alternative collision and mechanical repair products and specialty vehicle aftermarket products high fulfillment rates and superior customer service provides us with a competitive advantage to execute our strategy we are focused on a number of key areas including 

 north america segment 

our north america segment is composed of wholesale operations which consists of aftermarket and salvage operations and self service retail operations 

wholesale operations 

inventory 

our wholesale operations in north america sell all five product types aftermarket recycled remanufactured refurbished and to a lesser extent oem parts to professional collision and mechanical automobile repair businesses our principal aftermarket product types consist of those most frequently damaged in collisions including bumper covers automotive body panels lights and automotive glass products such as windshields platinum plus is our exclusive product line offered under the keystone brand of aftermarket products certain of our products are certified by independent organizations such as the certified automotive parts association “capa” and nsf international “nsf” capa and nsf are associations that evaluate the quality of aftermarket collision replacement products compared to oem collision replacement products we also developed a product line called value line for more value conscious often selfpay consumers our salvage products include both mechanical and collision parts including engines transmissions door assemblies sheet metal products such as trunk lids fenders and hoods lights and bumper assemblies 

the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from independent manufacturers and distributors located primarily in the us taiwan and china in 2017 approximately 39 of our aftermarket purchases were made from our top four vendors with our largest vendor providing approximately 16 of our annual inventory purchases we believe we are one of the largest customers of each of these suppliers outside of this group no other supplier provided more than 5 of our supply of aftermarket products in 2017 we purchased approximately 48 of our aftermarket products in 2017 directly from manufacturers in taiwan and other asian countries approximately 49 of our aftermarket products were purchased from vendors located in the us however we believe the majority of these products were manufactured in taiwan mexico or other foreign countries 

within our wholesale operations we focus our procurement on products that are in the most demand based on a number of factors such as historical sales records of vehicles by model and year customer requests projections of future supply and demand trends because lead times may take 40 days or more on imported aftermarket products sales volumes and instock inventory are important factors in the procurement process 

in our aftermarket operations we use a third party enterprise management system and other third party software packages to leverage the centralized data and information that a single system provides such as a data warehouse to conduct enhanced analytics and reporting an integrated budgeting system an electronic data interchange tool and ecommerce tools to enhance our online businesstobusiness initiatives  orderkeystonecom and keyless 

we procure recycled products for our wholesale operations by acquiring total loss vehicles typically sold at regional salvage auctions and then dismantling and inventorying the parts the availability and pricing of the salvage vehicles we procure for our wholesale recycled products operations may be impacted by a variety of factors including the production level of new vehicles and the portion of damaged vehicles declared total losses our bidding specialists are equipped with a proprietary software application that allows them to compare the vehicles at salvage auctions against our current inventory levels historical demand and recent average selling prices to arrive at an estimated maximum bid 

our wholesale recycled product locations in north america operate an internallydeveloped proprietary enterprise management system called lkqx we believe that the use of a single system across all of our wholesale recycled product operations helps facilitate the sales process allows for continued implementation of standard operating procedures and yields improved training efficiency employee transferability access to our national inventory database management reporting and data storage the system also supports an electronic exchange process for identifying and locating parts at other select recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock 

scrap and other materials 

our salvage operations generate scrap metal and other materials that we sell to metals recyclers vehicles that have been dismantled for recycled products and crush only endoflife vehicles acquired from other companies are typically crushed using equipment on site in other cases we will hire mobile crushing equipment to crush the vehicles before they are transported to shredders and scrap metal processors damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products including wheels we also extract and sell the precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts such as catalytic converters 

customers 

we sell our products to wholesale customers that include collision and mechanical repair shops and new and used car dealerships as well as to retail customers the majority of these customers tend to be individuallyowned small businesses although the number of independent and dealeroperated collision repair facilities has declined over the last decade as regional or national multiplelocation operators have increased their geographic presence through acquisitions 

automobile insurance companies affect the demand for our collision products while insurance companies do not pay for our products directly they ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount as a result insurance companies often influence the types of products used in a repair the use of our products provides a direct benefit to insurance companies by lowering the cost of repairs decreasing the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and providing a replacement product that is of high quality and comparable performance to the part replaced 

our sales personnel are encouraged to promote lkq to customers as a “onestop shop” by offering comparable options from our other product lines if the desired part is not in stock to support these efforts we have provided our sales staff with access to both recycled and aftermarket sales systems and we have developed sales incentive programs that encourage cross selling throughout our wholesale operations 

to better serve our customers we take a consolidated approach for the electronic sale of wholesale products in our north america segment a full suite of ecommerce services is available to approved partners that helps us improve order accuracy reduce return rate and better fit our customer workflow using these services in coordination with our partners products can be searched priced and ordered without leaving the customers own operating systems

we have a distribution network of warehouses and cross dock facilities which allows us to develop and maintain our service levels with local repair shops while providing fulfillment rates that are made possible by our nationwide presence our delivery fleet utilizes a third party software provider to optimize delivery routes and to track the progress of delivery vehicles throughout their runs our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries as required by our customers using drivers who routinely deliver to the same customers our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network we operate a delivery fleet of mediumsized trucks and smaller trucks and vans which deliver multiple product types on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs and improve customer service 

competition 

we consider all suppliers of vehicle collision and mechanical products to be competitors including aftermarket suppliers recycling businesses refurbishing operations parts remanufacturers oems and internetbased suppliers we compete with alternative parts distributors on the basis of our nationwide distribution system our product lines and inventory availability customer service our relationships with insurance companies and to a lesser extent price we compete with oems primarily on the basis of price and to a lesser extent on service and product quality we do not consider retail chains that focus on the doityourself market to be our direct competitors   since many of our wholesale product sales are paid for by insurance companies rather than the end user and there is limited overlap in the products that we sell 

self service operations 

our self service retail operations most of which operate under the name “lkq pick your part” allow consumers to come directly to the yard to pick parts off of endoflife vehicles in addition to revenue from the sale of parts core and scrap we charge a nominal admission fee to access the property 

inventory 

we acquire inventory for our self service retail product operations from a variety of sources including but not limited to towing companies auctions the general public municipality sales insurance carriers and charitable organizations we typically procure salvage vehicles that are more than seven model years old for our self service retail product operations these vehicles are generally older and of lower price than the salvage vehicles we purchase for our wholesale recycled product operations vehicles are delivered to our locations by the seller or we arrange for transportation once on our property minimal labor is required to process the vehicle other than removing the battery fluids refrigerants catalytic converters and hazardous materials the extracted fluids are stored in bulk and subsequently sold to recyclers in the case of gasoline the fuel retrieved is primarily used to power our delivery vehicles vehicles are then placed in the yard for customers to remove parts in our self service business availability of a specific part will depend on which vehicles are currently at the site and to what extent parts may have been previously sold we usually keep a vehicle at our facility for 30 to 120 days depending on the capacity of the yard and size of the market before it is crushed and sold to scrap metal processors 

scrap and other materials 

our self service operations generate scrap metal alloys and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that we no longer make available to the public and crush only vehicles acquired from other companies are typically crushed using equipment on site damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum 

ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products including wheels we also extract and sell the precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts such as catalytic converters 

customers 

the customers of our self service yards are frequently doityourself mechanics small independent repair shops servicing older vehicles auto rebuilders and resellers the scrap from the vehicle hulks when not processed by us is sold to metals recyclers with whom we may also compete when procuring salvage vehicles for our operations 

competition 

there are competitors operating self service businesses in all of the markets in which we operate in some markets there are numerous competitors often operating in close proximity to our operations we try to differentiate our business by the quality of the inventory and the size and cleanliness of the property we do not consider retail chains that focus on the doityourself market to be our direct competitors as there is limited overlap in the products that we sell 

europe segment 

the europe segment was built on three key acquisitions ecp 2011 sator 2013 and rhiag 2016 our european strategy is to target platform acquisitions to cover the broad markets initially then integrate these businesses with our existing operations and subsequently expand our footprint in these regions through new branch openings and smaller tuckin acquisitions with the goal of eventually attaining continentwide coverage our acquisitions provide a platform to capitalize on the large and fragmented aftermarket mechanical replacement parts market in europe and allow for potential cost savings from the leveraging of our combined purchasing power given the significant overlap in suppliers and product mix our pending acquisition of stahlgruber will further enhance our paneuropean platform including the creation of future opportunities for logistics and infrastructure optimization in 2014 we expanded our european segment to include wholesale recycling operations through our acquisition of a business with salvage and vehicle repair facilities in sweden and norway in addition to expanding our geographic presence in europe we believe these acquisitions provide us with the opportunity to leverage our experience in operating salvage facilities in a new market and to expand our aftermarket operations to include these countries in 2016 we acquired an equity investment in mekonomen ab mekonomen the leading independent car parts and service chain in the nordic region of europe mekonomen is independent of our existing european operations but we are exploring areas where the companies can work together in a mutually beneficial manner we have acquired many smaller businesses within these regions and over time we anticipate further integration of our european operations as we optimize purchasing warehousing cataloging logistics and backoffice functions and align our private label brands across the segment 

inventory 

our inventory is primarily composed of mechanical aftermarket parts for the repair of vehicles 3 to 15 years old our top selling products include brake pads discs and sensors clutches electrical products such as spark plugs and batteries steering and suspension products filters and oil and automotive fluids in addition to mechanical aftermarket parts we also sell collision parts in our europe operations although these sales represent less than 3 of segment revenue we believe the historically low alternative collision parts usage percentage in europe provides an opportunity for us in this segment particularly as insurance companies look to lower their costs 

in 2017 our top five suppliers represented 22 of our aftermarket inventory purchases with our top two suppliers each representing approximately 7 of our purchases no other suppliers comprised more than 5 of our purchases during 2017 the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from vendors located primarily in the uk and continental europe in 2017 we purchased 92 of our products from companies in europe the remaining 8 of our 2017 purchases were sourced from vendors located primarily in china or taiwan some of which also supply collision parts for our wholesale  north america operations in 2017 55 31 and 7 of our total inventory purchases were made in euros pounds sterling and us dollars respectively 

our aftermarket operations in europe use various it systems some of which are linked to transfer data between systems to manage customer orders and inventory movement and for financial reporting purposes certain of our it systems can interface with our repair shop customers respective it systems which enables them to identify the part required for the repair we are evaluating our existing european systems to determine the optimal longterm strategy which we believe will include reducing the number of systems we operate 

in our nordic operations we purchase severely damaged or totaled vehicles from insurance companies which are transferred to our dismantling facilities or sold to other third party dismantlers 

customers 

we primarily operate under a twostep ie direct sales to customers distribution model in europe although certain of our operations such as italy and switzerland operate under a threestep ie sales to distributors who in turn sell to customers 

distribution model in our twostep operations we sell the majority of our products to commercial customers primarily consisting of professional repairers including both independent mechanical repair shops and collision repair shops in our threestep operations we sell products to wholesale distributors or jobbers in addition to our sales to repair shops and wholesale distributors we generate a portion of our revenue through sales to retail customers from ecp’s ecommerce platform and from counter sales at the branch locations 

distribution 

our european operations employ a distribution model in which inventory is stored at regional distribution centers or hubs with fast moving product stored at branch locations or at local warehouse distributors for some of our netherlands italy and czech republic operations for timely delivery to the repair shop customers product is moved through the distribution network on our vans or via common carrier in our uk operations we also sometimes employ a third party motorcycle fleet to deliver parts from our branch locations to nearby repair shop customers 

in the uk we expanded our distribution capabilities by building a new national distribution center in tamworth which was completed in 2017 

competition 

we view all suppliers of replacement repair products as our competitors including other alternative parts suppliers and oems and their dealer networks while we compete with all alternative parts suppliers there are few with national distribution networks like ours that can reach the majority of repair shop customers within the required delivery time in their respective markets we believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other alternative parts suppliers primarily through our distribution network efficient stock management systems and proprietary technology which allows us to deliver our products quickly as well as through our product lines and inventory availability pricing and service we compete with oems primarily on the basis of price service and availability 

specialty segment 

our specialty operating segment was formed in 2014 with our acquisition of keystone specialty a leading distributor and marketer of specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories in north america our specialty operations reach most major markets in the us and canada and serves the following six product segments truck and offroad speed and performance rv towing wheels tires and performance handling and miscellaneous accessories in november 2017 we acquired warn industries inc warn a leading designer manufacturer and marketer of high performance vehicle equipment and accessories we expect the acquisition of warn to expand our presence in the specialty market and create viable points of entry into related markets 

inventory   

the specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories we distribute and raw materials for products we manufacture are purchased from suppliers located primarily in the us canada and china our top selling products are rv appliances  air conditioners towing hitches truck bed covers vehicle protection products cargo management products and wheels tires  suspension products specialty aftermarket suppliers are typically small to mediumsized independent businesses that focus on a narrow product or market niche due to the highly fragmented supplier base for specialty vehicle aftermarket products we have limited supplier concentration in 2017 approximately 26 of our specialty vehicle aftermarket purchases were made from our top five suppliers with our largest vendor providing approximately 10 of our annual inventory purchases no other suppliers comprised more than 5 of our purchases during 2017 with our november 2017 acquisition of warn we have internal manufacturing capabilities to source aftermarket winches hoists and bumpers 

our specialty operations utilize an internally developed inventory management and order entry system that interfaces with third party software systems for accounting transaction processing data analytics and reporting 

customers 

overall the specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and accessories market contains a fragmented customer base composed of rv and specialty automotive dealers installers jobbers builders parts chains and mailorder businesses our customers are principally small independent businesses these customers depend on us to provide a broad range of products rapid delivery marketing support and technical assistance in addition to traditional customers in recent years we have increased sales to several large parts and accessory online retailers our specialty segment also operates retail stores in northeast pennsylvania 

we promote our products to customers through marketing programs which include catalogs advertising sponsorships and promotional activities product level marketing and merchandising support and online initiatives our national footprint allows us to stage trade shows across the us which provide an opportunity to improve sales through the showcasing of new and innovative products from our vendors to our customers 

online sales of our specialty products take place through our ekeystonecom and viantpcom sites these sites provide customers i the ability to match products with the make and model of car thus allowing the customer to order the right part ii the product information eg pictures attributes available for review and iii the convenience of searching inventory availability and ordering the product on the site additionally the site can provide sales opportunities by suggesting other parts to purchase based on an inquiry submitted by the customer 

distribution 

our specialty segment operations employ a hubandspoke distribution model which enables us to transport products from our primary distribution centers to our noninventory stocking cross docks a majority of which are colocated with our north america wholesale operations and provide distribution points to key regional markets and synergies with our existing infrastructure we believe this provides added value to our customers through a broader product offering and more efficient distribution process we use our delivery routes to provide multiday per week delivery and returns of our products directly to and from our customers in all 48 continental us states and 9 canadian provinces and we ship globally to customers in other countries our delivery fleet utilizes a third party software provider to optimize delivery routes and to track the progress of delivery vehicles throughout their runs 

competition 

industry participants have a variety of supply choices vendors can deliver products to market via warehouse distributors and mail order catalog businesses or directly to retailers andor consumers we view all suppliers of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories as our competitors while we compete with all specialty vehicle aftermarket parts suppliers there are few with national distribution networks like lkq’s that can reach the majority of customers within the optimum delivery time we believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and equipment suppliers primarily through our broad product selection which encompasses both popular and hardtofind products our distribution network and efficient inventory management systems as well as through our service we compete on the basis of product breadth and depth rapid and dependable delivery marketing initiatives support services and price 

intellectual property 

we own various trade names and trademarks as a result of past acquisitions in addition to acquired trade names and trademarks we also have technologybased intellectual property that has been both internally developed and obtained through license agreements we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any single or group of related trademarks licenses or registrations nor would the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property license agreement materially affect our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2017 we employed approximately 43000 persons of which approximately 22000 were employed in north america and approximately 21000 were employed outside of north america of our employees in north america approximately 1200 were represented by unions outside of north america we have governmentmandated collective bargaining agreements and union contracts in certain countries particularly in europe where many of our employees are represented by unions andor works councils we consider our employee relations to be good 

facilities 

as of december 31 2017 our operations included approximately 1500 facilities most of which are leased of our total facilities approximately 550 facilities were located in the us and approximately 950 facilities were located in 24 other countries many of our locations stock multiple product types or serve more than one function 

our corporate headquarters are located at 500 west madison street chicago illinois 60661 we operate a field support center in nashville tennessee that performs certain centralized functions for our north american operations including accounting procurement and information systems support in 2017 we announced our plans to expand the size of our field support center via construction of a new 100000 square foot facility in nashville our specialty operations maintain primary procurement accounting and finance functions in exeter pennsylvania certain backoffice support functions for our segments are performed in bangalore india our european operations maintain procurement accounting and finance functions in wembley outside of london england and tamworth england in schiedam the netherlands in milan italy and in prague czech republic in addition to these offices we have two national distribution centers in tamworth totaling 1 million and 500000 square feet which house inventory to supply the hubs and branches of our uk operations additionally we operate an aftermarket parts warehouse in taiwan to aggregate inventory for shipment to our locations in north america 

regulation 

    our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment in the us and the other countries in which we operate see the risk factor “we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters” in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding the effects of environmental laws and regulations on us 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related repairs our specialty vehicle operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the first half of the year when vehicle owners tend to install this equipment our aftermarket glass operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the second and third quarters when the demand for glass replacements increases after the winter weather 




 item 1a risk factors 

our operating results and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the economic and political conditions in the us and elsewhere 

changes in economic and political conditions in the us europe and other countries in which we are located or do business could have a material effect on our company changes in such conditions have in some periods resulted in fewer miles driven fewer accident claims and a reduction of vehicle repairs all of which could negatively affect our business the number and types of new vehicles produced and sold by manufacturers affects our business a decrease in the number of vehicles on the road results in a decrease in repairs 

our sales are also impacted by changes to the economic health of vehicle owners the economic health of vehicle owners is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit taxation fuel prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside of our control if any of these conditions worsen our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities and hedge transactions these unfavorable events affecting our business partners could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we have a substantial business presence in europe including a significant presence in the united kingdom in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom decided by referendum to withdraw from the european union the precise timing and impacts of this action on our businesses in the united kingdom and other parts of europe are unknown at this time since the vote we have seen fluctuations in exchange rates leading to pricing pressures and unfavorable translation effects on our sterling denominated earnings as the details of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union are negotiated and implemented our european businesses could be adversely affected as a result of further fluctuations in exchange rates disruptions to access to markets by united kingdom companies interruptions of the movement of goods and services between countries a decrease of economic activity in europe and political or social unrest 

we face intense competition from local national international and internetbased vehicle products providers and this competition could negatively affect our business 

the vehicle replacement products industry is highly competitive and is served by numerous suppliers of oem recycled aftermarket refurbished and remanufactured products within each of these categories of suppliers there are local owneroperated companies larger regional suppliers national and international providers and internetbased suppliers and distributors providers of vehicle replacement products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of vehicle replacement products which may further increase competition some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise greater financial technical manufacturing distribution and other resources longer operating histories lower cost structures and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries or with consumers than we do 

in certain regions of the us local vehicle recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in the wholesale recycled products industry similarly in europe some local companies are part of cooperative efforts to compete in the aftermarket parts industry as a result of these factors our competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply provide their products at lower costs or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve 

we believe that a majority of collision parts by dollar amount are supplied by oems with the balance being supplied by distributors of alternative aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured collision parts like us the oems are therefore able to exert pricing pressure in the marketplace we compete with the oems primarily on price and to a lesser extent on service and quality from time to time the oems have implemented programs seeking to increase their market share in the collision repair parts industry for example they have reduced prices on specific products to match the lower prices of alternative products and introduced other rebate programs that may disrupt our sales the growth of these programs or the introduction of new ones could have a material adverse impact on our business 

in addition vehicles are being equipped with systems that transmit data to the oems wirelessly regarding among other items accident incidents maintenance requirements location of the vehicle identification of the closest dealership and other statistics about the vehicle and its driving history to the extent that this data is not shared with alternative suppliers the oems will have an advantage with respect to such matters as contacting the vehicle driver recommending repairs and maintenance and directing the vehicle owner to an affiliated dealership 

we rely upon our customers and insurance companies to promote the usage of alternative parts 

our success depends in part on the acceptance and promotion of alternative collision parts usage by automotive insurance companies there can be no assurance that current levels of alternative parts usage will be maintained or will increase in the future 

we also rely on business relationships with insurance companies these insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide the business relationships include in some cases participation in aftermarket quality and service assurance programs that may result in a higher usage of our aftermarket products than would be the case without the programs our arrangements with these companies may be terminated by them at any time including in connection with their own business concerns relating to the offering availability standards or operations of the aftermarket quality and service assurance programs we rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in an illinois lawsuit involving state farm mutual automobile insurance company avery v state farm a jury decided in october 1999 that state farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using nonoem replacement products to repair damaged vehicles when use of such products did not restore the vehicle to its preloss condition the jury found that state farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of nonoem replacement products and the alleged inferiority of those products the jury assessed damages against state farm of 456 million and the judge assessed an additional 730 million of disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the illinois consumer fraud act in april 2001 the illinois appellate court upheld the verdict but reduced the damage award by 130 million because of duplicative damage awards on august 18 2005 the illinois supreme court reversed the awards made by the circuit court and found among other things that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any breach of contract by state farm the us supreme court declined to hear an appeal of this case as a result of this case some insurance companies reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket products our financial results could be adversely affected if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled products from us due to a fear of similar claims 

in addition to the extent that the collision repair industry continues to consolidate the buying power of collision repair shop customers may further increase putting additional pressure on our financial returns 

we may not be able to successfully acquire new businesses or integrate acquisitions which could cause our business to suffer 

we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms if we do not obtain required antitrust or other regulatory approvals or for other reasons moreover we may not be able to identify a sufficient number of acquisition candidates at reasonable prices to maintain our growth objectives also over time we will likely seek to make acquisitions that are relatively larger larger acquisition candidates may attract additional competitive buyers which could increase our cost or could cause us to lose such acquisitions 

if we buy a company or a division of a company we may experience difficulty integrating that companys or divisions personnel and operations which could negatively affect our operating results in addition 



 claims by oems relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business 

oems and other manufacturers have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims the oems have brought such claims in federal court and with the us international trade commission 

to the extent oems and other manufacturers are seeking and obtaining more design patents than they have in the past and are successful in asserting infringement of these patents and defending their validity we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business we will likely incur significant expenses investigating and defending intellectual property infringement claims in addition aftermarket products certifying organizations may revoke the certification of parts that are the subject of the claims lack of certification may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of aftermarket products only if they have been certified by an independent certifying organization 

in december 2005 and may 2008 ford global technologies llc filed complaints with the international trade commission against us and others alleging that certain aftermarket products imported into the us infringed on ford design patents the parties settled these matters in april 2009 pursuant to a patent license arrangement that is currently scheduled to expire in march 2020 in january 2014 chrysler group llc filed a complaint against us in the us district court in the eastern district of michigan contending that certain aftermarket parts we sell infringe chrysler design patents the parties settled this matter in june 2014 pursuant to a patent license arrangement that expires in june 2019 in the event that these license arrangements or other similar license arrangements with oems are terminated or we are unable to agree upon renewal terms we may be subject to costs and uncertainties of litigation as well as restrictions on our ability to sell aftermarket parts that replicate parts covered by design patents 

if the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines or the number of cars being repaired declines or the mix of the types of vehicles in the overall vehicle population changes our business could suffer 

our business depends on vehicle accidents mechanical failures and routine maintenance for both the demand for repairs using our products and the supply of recycled remanufactured and refurbished parts to the extent that a relatively higher percentage of damaged vehicles are declared total losses there will be less demand for our products to repair such vehicles in addition our business is impacted by factors which influence the number andor severity of accidents and mechanical failures including but not limited to the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven the ages of drivers the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions the congestion of traffic drivers distracted by electronic equipment the use of alcohol or drugs by drivers the usage rate and effectiveness of accident avoidance systems in new vehicles the reliability of new oem parts and the condition of roadways for example an increase in the acceptance of ridesharing could reduce the number of vehicles on the road additionally an increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the need for mechanical repairs and maintenance to decline as motorists seek alternative transportation options mild weather conditions particularly during winter months tend to result in a decrease in vehicle accidents moreover a number of states and municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones or other electronic devices while driving and such restrictions could lead to a decline in accidents 

systems designed to minimize accident frequency and severity are becoming more prevalent and more technologically sophisticated to the extent oems install or are mandated by law to install accident avoidance systems in their vehicles the number and severity of accidents could decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the average number of new vehicles sold annually has fluctuated from yeartoyear periods of decreased sales could result in a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road and consequently fewer vehicles involved in accidents or in need of mechanical repair or maintenance substantial further declines in automotive sales in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition in addition if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of older vehicles on the road insurance companies may find it uneconomical to repair such 

vehicles or there could be less costly repairs if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of newer vehicles on the road the demand generally for mechanical repairs and maintenance would likely decline due to the newer longerlasting parts in the vehicle population and mechanical failures being covered by oem warranties for the first years of a vehicles life moreover alternative collision and mechanical parts are less likely to be used on newer vehicles 

electric vehicles do not have traditional engines transmissions and certain related parts engines and transmissions represent our largest revenue generating skus in north america and parts for engines and transmissions represent a significant amount of the revenue of our european operations thus an increase in electric vehicles as a percentage of vehicles sold will have a negative impact on our sales of engines transmissions and other related parts 

fluctuations in the prices of metals and other commodities could adversely affect our financial results 

our recycling operations generate scrap metal and other metals that we sell after we dismantle a salvage vehicle for wholesale parts and after vehicles have been processed in our self service retail business the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors and other remaining metals are sold to processors and brokers of metals in addition we receive crush only vehicles from other companies including oems which we dismantle and which generate scrap metal and other metals the prices of scrap and other metals have historically fluctuated sometimes significantly due to market factors in addition buyers may stop purchasing metals entirely due to excess supply to the extent that the prices of metals decrease materially or buyers stop purchasing metals our revenue from such sales will suffer and a writedown of our inventory value could be required 

the cost of our wholesale recycled and our self service retail inventory purchases will change as a result of fluctuating scrap metal and other metals prices in a period of falling metal prices there can be no assurance that our inventory purchasing cost will decrease the same amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal and other metals prices decline and there may be a delay between the scrap metal and other metals price reductions and any inventory cost reductions the prices of steel aluminum and plastics are components of the cost to manufacture products for our aftermarket business if the prices of commodities rise and result in higher costs to us for products we sell we may not be able to pass these higher costs on to our customers 

existing or new laws and regulations may prohibit restrict or burden the sale of aftermarket recycled refurbished or remanufactured products 

most states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair work these laws include requirements relating to consumer disclosure vehicle owner’s consent regarding the use of aftermarket products in the repair process and the requirement to have aftermarket products certified by an independent testing organization additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future if additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business 

certain organizations test the quality and safety of vehicle replacement products if these organizations decide not to test a particular vehicle product or in the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product such events could adversely affect our business 

some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled products the passage of legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on our business additionally congress could enact federal legislation restricting the use of aftermarket or recycled automotive products used in the course of vehicle repairs 

the federal trade commission has issued guides which regulate the use of certain terms such as “rebuilt” or “remanufactured” in connection with the sale of automotive parts restrictions on the products we are able to sell and on the marketing of such products could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any covered major part the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on vehicle recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may discourage the use by such shops of recycled products there is no pending initiative to implement the parts registration from a law enforcement point of view however there is a risk that a heightened legislative concern over safety of parts might precipitate an effort to push for the implementation of such rules 

an adverse change in our relationships with our suppliers or a disruption to our supply of inventory could increase our expenses and impede our ability to serve our customers 

our north american business is dependent on a relatively small number of suppliers of aftermarket products a large portion of which are sourced from taiwan our european business also acquires product from asian sources we incur substantial freight costs to import parts from our suppliers many of which are located in asia if the cost of freight rose we might not be able to pass the cost increases on to our customers furthermore although alternative suppliers exist for substantially all aftermarket products distributed by us the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on us until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced providing products in addition we are subject to disruptions from work stoppages and other labor disputes at port facilities through which we import our inventory we also have the risk that our suppliers could attempt to circumvent us and sell their product directly to our customers 

moreover our operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad including among other things natural disasters transportation costs and delays political instability currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs import and export controls and other nontariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas as well as the uncertainty regarding future relations between china japan and taiwan the current us administration has discussed the implementation of a tariff on imports into the us the imposition of which would likely have a negative impact on our business due to the amount of inventory we import 

because a substantial volume of our sales involves products manufactured from sheet metal we can be adversely impacted if sheet metal becomes unavailable or is only available at higher prices which we may not be able to pass on to our customers additionally as oems convert to raw materials other than steel it may be more difficult or expensive to source aftermarket parts made with such materials and it may be more difficult for repair shops to work with such materials in the repair process 

most of our salvage and a portion of our self service inventory is obtained from vehicles offered at salvage auctions operated by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the us we do not typically have contracts with the auction companies according to industry analysts a small number of companies control a large percentage of the salvage auction market in the us if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions began competing with us or significantly raised its fees our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers moreover we face competition in the purchase of vehicles from direct competitors rebuilders exporters and other bidders to the extent that the number of bidders increases it may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold for wholesale recycled products some states regulate bidders to help ensure that salvage vehicles are purchased for legal purposes by qualified buyers auction companies have been actively seeking to reduce circumvent or eliminate these regulations which would further increase the number of bidders 

in addition there is a limited supply of salvage vehicles in the us as we grow and our demand for salvage vehicles increases the costs of these incremental vehicles could be higher in some states when a vehicle is deemed a total loss a salvage title is issued whether states issue salvage titles is important to the supply of inventory for the vehicle recycling industry because an increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles currently these titling issues are a matter of state law in 1992 the us congress commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle titling registration and salvage since then legislation has been introduced seeking to establish national uniform requirements in this area including a uniform definition of a salvage vehicle the vehicle recycling industry will generally favor a uniform definition since it will avoid inconsistencies across state lines and will generally favor a definition that expands the number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage however certain interest groups including repair shops and some insurance associations may oppose this type of legislation national legislation has not yet been enacted in this area and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in the future 

we also acquire inventory directly from insurance companies oems and others to the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue these arrangements our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers 

in europe we acquire product from a wide variety of suppliers as vehicle technology changes some parts will become more complex and the design or technology of those parts may be covered by patents or other rights that make it difficult for aftermarket suppliers to produce for sale to companies such as ours the complexity of the parts may include software or other technical aspects that make it difficult to identify what is wrong with the vehicle more complex parts may be difficult to repair and may require expensive or difficult to obtain software updates limiting our ability to compete with the oems 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control 

future factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to those listed in the special note on forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k accordingly our results of operations may not be indicative of future performance these fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below our published financial guidance and the expectations of public markets which could cause our stock price or the value of our debt instruments to decline 

if we lose our key management personnel we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives if we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel which could harm our business 

we operate in foreign jurisdictions which exposes us to foreign exchange and other risks 

we have operations in north america europe and taiwan and we may expand our operations in the countries in which we do business and into other countries our foreign operations expose us to additional risks associated with international business which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition including import and export requirements and compliance with anticorruption laws such as the uk bribery act 2010 and the foreign corrupt practices act we also incur costs in currencies other than our functional currencies in some of the countries in which we operate we are thus subject to foreign exchange exposure to the extent that we operate in different currencies as well as exposure to foreign tax and other foreign and domestic laws in addition certain countries in which we operate have a higher level of political instability and criminal activity relative to the us that could affect our operations and the ability to maintain our supply of products 

if we determine that our goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired we may incur significant charges to our pretax income 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations in the future goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of acquisitions goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses increases in our cost of capital adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including modifications that restrict the activities of the acquired business as of december 31 2017 our total goodwill subject to future impairment testing was 35 billion  for further discussion of our annual impairment test see goodwill impairment in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of item 7 in this annual report on form 10k 

except for indefinitelived intangibles we amortize other intangible assets over the assigned useful lives each of which is based upon the expected period to be benefited we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we review finitelived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in the event conditions change that affect our ability to realize the underlying cash flows associated with our intangible assets we may record an impairment charge as of december 31 2017  the value of our other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization was 744 million  

our business may be adversely affected by union activities and labor and employment laws 

certain of our employees are represented by labor unions and other employee representative bodies and work under collective bargaining or similar agreements which are subject to periodic renegotiation from time to time there have been efforts to organize additional portions of our workforce and those efforts can be expected to continue in addition legislators and government agencies could adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations that could make it significantly easier for unionization efforts to be successful also we may in the future be subject to strikes or work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disruptions and disputes additional unionization efforts new collective bargaining or similar agreements and work stoppages could materially increase our costs and reduce revenue and could limit our flexibility in terms of work schedules reductions in force and other operational matters 

we also are subject to laws and regulations that govern such matters as minimum wage overtime and other working conditions some of these laws are technical in nature and could be subject to interpretation by government agencies and courts different than our interpretations efforts to comply with existing laws changes to such laws and newlyenacted laws may increase our labor costs and limit our flexibility if we were found not to be in compliance with such laws we could be subject to fines penalties and liabilities to our employees or government agencies in addition efforts to better protect local markets from foreign workers and decisions of countries to withdraw from treaties and joint economic areas may lead to increased 

restrictions on the free movement of people and labor and may limit our ability to place key personnel where it could best serve our needs 

we rely on information technology and communication systems in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business 

in the ordinary course of business we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are leased from third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans our information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals breaches due to employee error or malfeasance disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware terminations of business relationships by third party service providers power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures terrorist acts natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation any of which could adversely affect our business in addition as security threats continue to evolve we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems 

in the event that we decide to switch providers or to implement upgrades or replacements to our own systems we may be unsuccessful in the development of our own systems or we may underestimate the costs and expenses of switching providers or developing and implementing our own systems also our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system which period could extend longer than we anticipated 

the costs of complying with the requirements of laws pertaining to the privacy and security of personal information and the potential liability associated with the failure to comply with such laws could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we collect personally identifiable information pii and other data as part of our business processes and operations the legislative and regulatory framework relating to privacy and data protection is rapidly evolving worldwide and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future this data is subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations many foreign countries and governmental bodies including the european union canada and other jurisdictions where we conduct business have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of pii and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions that are more restrictive than those in the us additionally the european union adopted the general data protection regulation gdpr that will impose more stringent data protection requirements for processors and controllers of personal data including expanded disclosures about how pii is to be used limitations on retention of pii mandatory data breach notification requirements and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities the gdpr will become effective in may 2018 and there can be no assurance that we will timely have all processes implemented for full compliance with the regulation the gdpr provides severe penalties for noncompliance 

any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection issues even if unfounded or comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations including at newlyacquired companies could result in additional cost and liability to us result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions give rise to civil litigation damage to our reputation including the loss of trust by our customers and employees inhibit sales and otherwise adversely affect our business we also may be subject to these adverse effects if other parties with whom we do business including lenders suppliers consultants and advisors violate applicable laws or contractual obligations or suffer a security breach 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our operations the function of our computer systems andor the availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in the closure of our distribution centers or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory through our system on a timely basis this may affect our ability to serve our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the us or into the other countries in which we operate and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters 

we are subject to various environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials 

and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators or lose our operating permits we could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials we have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements we cannot assure you however that we will at all times be in complete compliance with such requirements 

we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future 

under certain environmental laws we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at or migration to or from our or our predecessors past or present facilities and at independent waste disposal sites these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or was not responsible for the release of such hazardous substances many of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use that may have involved hazardous materials as a result some of our properties may be contaminated some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination these environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of treats or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties or successors to such owners or operators for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 

contamination resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release storage transportation or disposal of gasoline motor oil antifreeze transmission fluid chlorofluorocarbons cfcs from air conditioners other hazardous materials or metals such as aluminum cadmium chromium lead and mercury contamination from the refurbishment of chrome plated bumpers can occur from the release of the plating material contamination can migrate onsite or offsite which can increase the risk and the amount of any potential liability 

when we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process we analyze the risks and when appropriate perform further environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination furthermore where appropriate we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters in the event we discover new information or if laws change we may incur significant liabilities which may exceed our reserves 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we could be subject to product liability claims and involved in product recalls 

if customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage we could be subject to product liability claims by such customers the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we may become involved in the recall of a product that is determined to be defective more generally a recall involving alternative parts even if we did not sell the recalled products could adversely affect the perceived quality of alternative parts leading to decreased usage of alternative parts the expenses of a recall and the damage to our reputation or the reputation of alternative parts generally could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have agreed to defend and indemnify in certain circumstances insurance companies and customers against claims and damages relating to product liability and product recalls the existence of claims or damages for which we must defend and indemnify these parties could also negatively impact our business results of operations or financial condition 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits 

our operating subsidiaries in our salvage selfservice and refurbishing operations must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations when we develop or acquire a new facility we must seek the approval of state and local units of government governmental agencies may resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling or refurbishing facility in their communities there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold 

new regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and otherwise adversely impact our business  

in august 2012 as mandated by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec adopted final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals originating from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries these new requirements impose significant burdens on us public companies compliance with the rules requires substantial due diligence in an effort to determine whether products contain the conflict minerals the results of such due diligence efforts must be disclosed on an annual basis in a filing with the sec 

our supply chain is complex and we may incur significant costs to determine the source of any such minerals used in our products we may also incur costs with respect to potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of our diligence activities further the implementation of these rules and their effect on customer supplier andor consumer behavior could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering products free of conflict minerals in some circumstances we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary products from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflictfree or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement accordingly these rules could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition 

if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks and other vehicles our business could be harmed 

we use a fleet of trucks and other vehicles to deliver the majority of the products we sell we are subject to the risks associated with providing delivery services including inclement weather disruptions in the transportation infrastructure governmental regulation availability and price of fuel liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance and insurance premium increases in addition our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may lose the right to operate at key locations 

we lease most of the properties at which we conduct our businesses at the end of a lease term we must negotiate a renewal exercise a purchase option to the extent we have that right or find a new location there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate renewals on terms acceptable to us or that we will find a suitable alternative location especially with respect to our salvage operations which have characteristics that are often not attractive to landlords or local governments in such cases we may lose the right to operate at key locations 

our effective tax rate could materially increase as a consequence of various factors including interpretations and administrative guidance in regard to the tax act defined below us andor international tax legislation mix of earnings by jurisdiction and us and foreign jurisdictional audits 

we are a us based multinational company subject to income taxes in the us and a number of foreign jurisdictions therefore we are subject to changes in tax laws in each of these jurisdictions and such changes could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate and cash flows 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act among other things the tax act reduces the us statutory corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 additionally beginning in 2018 the tax act imposes a regime of taxation on foreign subsidiary earnings global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” and on certain related party payments base erosion antiabuse tax “beat” other important changes potentially material to the our operations include the full expensing of certain assets placed into service after september 27 2017 the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction and additional limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation finally as part of the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system the tax act imposes a onetime transition tax on the deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 other than the transition tax and revaluation of deferred tax balances which are applicable to us for 2017 the provisions will generally be applicable in 2018 and beyond in accordance with the guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 118 in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded provisional reasonable estimates of the impact of the tax act including 51 million for the transition tax and a deferred tax benefit of 73 million related to the revaluation of deferred tax balances based on the new rate we are continuing to analyze the tax act and plan to finalize the estimate within the measurement period outlined in sab no118 the final adjustments may differ from the provisional reasonable estimates and such difference may be material if provisions of the tax act and their interaction with other provisions of the us internal revenue code are interpreted differently than interpretations made by us in determining the estimates whether through issuance of administrative guidance or through further review of the tax act depending upon future interpretations and administrative guidance in respect of the tax act’s base broadening provisions the tax act could have a material adverse effect on the company’s effective tax rate and cash flows 

certain nonus jurisdictions are considering tax legislation based upon recommendations made by the organization for economic cooperation and development in connection with its base erosion and profit shifting study the outcome of these legislative developments could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate and cash flows 

the tax rates applicable in the jurisdictions within which we operate vary widely therefore our effective tax rate may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of our earnings by jurisdiction 

we are also subject to ongoing audits of our income tax returns in various jurisdictions both in the us and internationally while we believe that our tax positions will be sustained the outcomes of such audits could result in the assessment of additional taxes which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results 

risks relating to our common stock and financial structure 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline additionally the market price for our common stock has been in the past and in the future may be adversely affected by allegations made or reports issued by short sellers analysts activists or others regarding our business model our management or our financial accounting 

following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

delaware law our charter documents and our loan documents may impede or discourage a takeover which could affect the price of our stock 

the antitakeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws our loan documents and delaware law could together or separately impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult our credit agreement provides that a change of control is an event of default our incorporation under delaware law and these provisions could also impede an acquisition takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the price of our common stock 

future sales of our common stock or other securities may depress our stock price 

we and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock or other equity debt or instruments which constitute an element of our debt and equity collectively securities in the future we may also issue shares of common stock under our equity incentive plan or in connection with future acquisitions we cannot predict the size of future issuances of securities or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock or other securities will have on the price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued in connection with an acquisition the issuance of additional debt securities or the perception that such sales or issuances could occur may cause the price of our common stock to fall 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to react to changes in our business 

as of december 3 1 2017   we had approximately 21 billion  aggregate principal amount of secured debt outstanding and approximately 14 billion of availability under our credit agreement 15 billion of availability reduced by 71 million  of amounts outstanding under letters of credit in addition we had approximately 12 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured debt outstanding comprising 600 million  aggregate principal amount of 475  senior notes due may 15 2023  the us notes 2023 an d €500 million   600 million  aggregate principal amount of 3875 senior notes due april 1 2024  the euro notes 2024 and together with the us notes 2023 the senior notes borrowings under the credit agreement mature in january 2023 

our significant amount of debt and our debt service obligations could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations limit our ability to operate our business and impair our competitive position 

for example our debt and our debt service obligations could 

 in addition if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the ability to service such debt would increase 

our senior notes do not impose any limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or protect against certain other types of transactions 

although we are subject to our credit agreement for so long as it remains in effect the indentures governing the senior notes do not restrict the future incurrence of unsecured indebtedness guarantees or other obligations the indentures contain certain limitations on our ability to incur liens on assets and engage in sale and leaseback transactions however these limitations are subject to important exceptions in addition the indentures do not contain many other restrictions including certain restrictions contained in our credit agreement including without limitation investments or prepaying subordinated indebtedness or engaging in transactions with our affiliates 

our credit agreement will permit subject to specified conditions and limitations the incurrence of a significant amount of additional indebtedness as of december 31 2017 we would have been able to incur an additional 14 billion of indebtedness under our credit agreement 15 billion of availability reduced by 71 million  of amounts outstanding under letters of credit if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the ability to service such debt would increase if we close the acquisition of stahlgruber we will incur approximately 15 billion of additional debt to partially fund the purchase price this amount is subject to change depending on factors such as stahlgrubers debt at closing and the acquisition date exchange rate 

our credit agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

our credit agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability among other things to 

 as a result of these covenants and restrictions we will be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit agreement a default if not waived could result in acceleration of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing credit facilities or it may be on terms that are not acceptable to us 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due any future refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations additionally the credit agreement and the indentures that govern our senior notes limit the use of the proceeds from certain dispositions of our assets as a result our credit agreement and our senior notes may prevent us from using the proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all of our debt service obligations 

our future capital needs may require that we seek to refinance our debt or obtain additional debt or equity financing events that could have a negative effect on our business 

we may need to raise additional funds in the future to among other things refinance existing debt fund our existing operations improve or expand our operations respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions from time to time we may raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic alliances or other arrangements funds may not be available or available on terms acceptable to us as a result of different factors including but not limited to turmoil in the credit markets that results in the tightening of credit conditions and current or future regulations applicable to the financial institutions from whom we seek financing if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and further limitations on our operations if we refinance or restructure our debt we may incur charges to write off the unamortized portion of deferred debt issuance costs from a previous financing or we may incur charges related to hedge ineffectiveness from our interest rate swap obligations in addition there are restrictions in the indenture that governs the us notes 2023 on our ability to refinance such notes prior to may 15 2018 there are also restrictions in the indenture that governs the euro notes 2024 on our ability to refinance such notes prior to january 1 2024 if we fail to raise capital when needed our business may be negatively affected 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly and could affect the value of our senior notes 

certain borrowings under our credit agreement and the borrowing under our accounts receivable securitization facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness would correspondingly decrease moreover changes in market interest rates could affect the trading value of the notes assuming all revolving loans were fully drawn and no interest rate swaps were in place each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in a 36 million change in annual cash interest expense under our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization facility 

repayment of our indebtedness including our senior notes is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries 

we are a holding company and repayment of our senior notes will be dependent upon cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are borrowers or guarantors of the indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness including the senior notes each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries and under certain circumstances distributions from our subsidiaries may be subject to significant taxes that reduce the amount of such distributions available to us while the indentures governing the senior notes limit the ability of our subsidiaries to restrict the payment of dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness including the senior notes 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our senior notes 

credit ratings have an important effect on our cost of capital credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include among other items our results of operations business decisions that we make their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading we believe our current credit ratings enhance our ability to borrow funds at favorable rates a downgrade in our current credit rating from a rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facilities a downgrade could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our senior notes preventing a holder from selling the senior notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affecting our ability to issue new notes in the future or incur other indebtedness upon favorable terms 

  the right to receive payments on the senior notes is effectively junior to those lenders who have a security interest in our assets 

our obligations under our senior notes and our guarantors’ obligations under their guarantees of the senior notes are unsecured but our and each coborrower’s obligations under our credit agreement and each guarantor’s obligations under their respective guarantees of the credit agreement are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our domestic tangible and intangible assets including the stock of most of our whollyowned united states subsidiaries and the stock of certain of our nonunited states subsidiaries if we are declared bankrupt or insolvent or if we default under our credit agreement the lenders could declare all of the funds borrowed thereunder together with accrued interest immediately due and payable if we were unable to repay such indebtedness the lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets to the exclusion of holders of our senior notes even if an event of default exists under the applicable indenture governing the senior notes furthermore if the lenders foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any subsidiary guarantor under our senior notes then that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the senior notes automatically and immediately upon such sale in any such event because the senior notes are not secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in subsidiary guarantors it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from which claims by holders of the senior notes could be satisfied or if any assets remained they might be insufficient to satisfy claims fully as of december   31 2017   we had approximately 21 billion  aggregate principal amount of secured debt outstanding and approximately 14 billion of availability under the credit agreement 15 billion of availability reduced by 71 million  of amounts outstanding under letters of credit 

united states federal and state statutes allow courts under specific circumstances to void the senior notes   and the guarantees subordinate claims in respect of the senior notes and the guarantees and require holders of the senior notes to return payments received from us or the guarantors 

our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that are obligors under the credit agreement guarantee the obligations under our senior notes in addition certain subsidiaries of the issuer of the euro notes 2024 guarantee the obligations under the euro notes 2024 the issuance of our senior notes and the issuance of the guarantees by the guarantors may be subject to review under state and federal laws if a bankruptcy liquidation or reorganization case or a lawsuit including in circumstances in which bankruptcy is not involved were commenced at some future date by or on behalf of our unpaid creditors or the unpaid creditors of a guarantor under the federal bankruptcy laws of the united states and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws a court may avoid or otherwise decline to enforce the senior notes or a guarantor’s guarantee or may subordinate the senior notes or such guarantee to our or the applicable guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness while the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction a court might do so if it found that when indebtedness under the senior notes was issued or when the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee or in some jurisdictions when payments became due under the senior notes or such guarantee the issuer or the applicable guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and 

 a court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the senior notes or such guarantee if we or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the senior notes thus if the guarantees were legally challenged any guarantee could be subject to the claim that since the guarantee was incurred for our benefit and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration if a court were to void the issuance of the senior notes or any guarantee a holder of the senior notes would no longer have any claim against us or the applicable guarantor in the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred a holder of the senior notes may not receive any repayment on the senior notes further the avoidance of the senior notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt which could result in acceleration of that debt the measures of insolvency for 

purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred generally however an issuer or a guarantor as applicable would be considered insolvent if 

 a court might also void the senior notes or a guarantee without regard to the above factors if the court found that the senior notes were incurred or issued or the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee with actual intent to hinder delay or defraud its creditors we cannot give any assurance as to what standard a court would apply in determining whether we or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard or regardless of the standard that a court uses that it would not determine that we or a guarantor were indeed insolvent on that date that any payments to the holders of the senior notes including under the guarantees did not constitute preferences fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds or that the issuance of the senior notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to our or any guarantor’s other debt in addition any payment by us or a guarantor pursuant to the senior notes or its guarantee could be avoided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors and accordingly the court might direct holders of the senior notes to repay any amounts already received from us or such guarantor among other things under us bankruptcy law any payment by us pursuant to the senior notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time we or such guarantor were found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a oneyear period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside party and such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such party would have received in a distribution under the bankruptcy code in a hypothetical chapter 7 case although each guarantee contains a “savings clause” intended to limit the subsidiary guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its subsidiary guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer this provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect any subsidiary guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law in that regard in official committee of unsecured creditors of   tousa inc v citicorp north america inc   the united states bankruptcy court in the southern district of florida held that a savings clause similar to the savings clause included in our indentures was unenforceable as a result the subsidiary guarantees were found to be fraudulent conveyances the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit subsequently affirmed the liability findings of the bankruptcy court without ruling directly on the enforceability of savings clauses generally if the decision of the bankruptcy court in tousa  were followed by other courts the risk that the guarantees would be deemed fraudulent conveyances would be significantly increased 

to the extent a court avoids the senior notes or any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or holds the senior notes or any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason the holders of the senior notes would cease to have any direct claim against us or the applicable guarantor if a court were to take this action our or the applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy our or the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities if any and might not be applied to the payment of the senior notes sufficient funds to repay the senior notes may not be available from other sources including the remaining guarantors if any in addition the euro notes 2024 and the guarantees may be subject to avoidance under the laws of other foreign jurisdictions including italy and czech republic to the extent that we the issuer of the euro notes 2024 or any of the guarantors as applicable were to be the subject of an insolvency or related proceeding in such jurisdictions 

not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our credit agreement or our senior notes and the assets of our nonguarantor subsidiaries may not be available to make payments on such obligations 

not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the credit agreement our us notes 2023 or our euro notes 2024 in the event that any nonguarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent liquidates reorganizes dissolves or otherwise winds up holders of its indebtedness and its trade creditors generally will be entitled to payment on their claims from the assets of that subsidiary before any of those assets are made available to the lenders under the credit agreement or the holders of the senior notes consequently claims in respect of the credit agreement and the senior notes are structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors of such instruments including trade payables and any claims of third party holders of preferred equity interests if any in our nonguarantor subsidiaries for the year ended december 31 2017 our subsidiaries that are not borrowers under or do not guarantee the credit agreement and our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the us notes 2023 represented approximately 42 and 26 of our total revenue and operating income respectively in addition these nonguarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 49 and 41 of our total assets and total liabilities respectively as of december 31 2017   excluding in each case intercompany amounts as of the same date our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the credit agreement or the us notes 2023 had approximately 13 billion of outstanding indebtedness which includes 460 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities by foreign subsidiaries that are borrowers under the revolving credit facilities but that do not guarantee the us notes 2023 the group of subsidiaries that does not guarantee the 

euro notes 2024 is similar to the group that does not guarantee the us notes 2023 except that in addition to the issuer of the euro notes 2024 there are four subsidiaries in the group that does not guarantee the us notes 2023 that guarantee the euro notes 2024 

we may not be able to repurchase the senior notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer 

upon a change of control as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes the holders of the senior notes will have the right to require us to offer to purchase all of the senior notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest such a change of control would also be an event of default under our credit agreement in order to obtain sufficient funds to pay amounts due under the credit agreement and the purchase price of the outstanding senior notes we expect that we would have to refinance our indebtedness we cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance our indebtedness on reasonable terms if at all our failure to offer to purchase all outstanding senior notes or to purchase all validly tendered senior notes would be an event of default under the indenture such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other debt our other debt also may contain restrictions on repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture 

the definition of change of control in the indentures governing the senior notes includes a phrase relating to the sale of “all or substantially all” of our assets there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law accordingly the ability of a holder of senior notes to require us to repurchase its senior notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain 

in addition in certain circumstances as specified in the indentures governing the senior notes we will be required to commence an asset sale offer as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes pursuant to which we will be obligated to purchase certain senior notes at a price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest with the proceeds we receive from certain asset sales our other debt may contain restrictions that would limit or prohibit us from completing any such asset sale offer in particular our credit agreement contains provisions that require us upon the sale of certain assets to apply all of the proceeds from such asset sale to the prepayment of amounts due under the credit agreement the mandatory prepayment obligations under the credit agreement will be effectively senior to our obligations to make an asset sale offer with respect to the senior notes under the terms of the indentures governing the senior notes our failure to purchase any such senior notes when required under the indentures would be an event of default under the indentures 

  key terms of the senior notes will be suspended if the notes achieve investment grade ratings and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing 

many of the covenants in the indentures governing the senior notes will be suspended if the senior notes are rated investment grade by standard  poor’s and moody’s provided at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing including those covenants that restrict among other things our ability to pay dividends incur liens and to enter into certain other transactions there can be no assurance that the senior notes will ever be rated investment grade however suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force although provisions under our other debt like the credit agreement may continue to restrict us from engaging in these transactions and the effects of any such transactions will be permitted to remain in place even if the senior notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade 

the liquidity and market value of the senior notes may change due to a variety of factors 

the liquidity of any trading market in the senior notes and the market price quoted for the senior notes may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for these types of securities changes in interest rates changes in our ratings and changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industries generally 

we rely on an accounts receivable securitization program for a portion of our liquidity 

we have an arrangement whereby we sell an interest in a portion of our accounts receivable to a special purpose vehicle and receive funding through the commercial paper market this arrangement expires in november 2019 in the event that the market for commercial paper were to close or otherwise become constrained our cost of credit relative to this program could rise or credit could be unavailable altogether

see note 2 business combinations to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information related to our acquisitions 

sources of revenue 

we report our revenue in two categories i parts and services and ii other our parts revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products including i aftermarket other new and refurbished products and ii recycled remanufactured and related products our service revenue is generated primarily from the sale of extended warranties fees for admission to our self service yards and processing fees related to the secure disposal of vehicles during the year ended   december 31 2017  parts and services revenue represented approximately 95  of our consolidated revenue 

the majority of our parts and services revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle replacement products to collision and mechanical repair shops in our north america segment our vehicle replacement products include sheet metal crash parts such as doors hoods and fenders bumper covers head and tail lamps automotive glass products such as windshields mirrors and grills wheels and large mechanical items such as engines and transmissions in our europe segment our products include a wide variety of small mechanical products such as filters belts and hoses spark plugs alternators and water pumps batteries suspension and brake parts clutches and oil and lubricants the demand for these products is influenced by several factors including the number of vehicles in operation the number of miles being driven the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents the age profile of vehicles in accidents seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions and the availability and pricing of new oem parts with respect to collision related products automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process accordingly we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our vehicle replacement products in north america while they are not our direct customers we do provide insurance carriers services in an effort to promote the increased usage of alternative replacement products in the repair process such services include the review of vehicle repair order estimates direct quotation services to insurance company adjusters and an aftermarket parts quality and service assurance program we neither charge a fee to the insurance carriers for these services nor adjust our pricing to our customers when we perform these services for insurance carriers there is no standard price for many of our vehicle replacement products but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as new oem product prices product availability quality demand the age and mileage of the vehicle from which the part was obtained in the case of recycled products competitor pricing and our product cost 

our revenue from aftermarket other new and refurbished products also includes revenue generated from the sale of specialty aftermarket vehicle equipment and accessories these products are primarily sold to a large customer base of specialty vehicle retailers and equipment installers including mostly independent singlesite operators specialty vehicle aftermarket products are typically installed on vehicles within the first three years of ownership to enhance functionality performance or aesthetics as a result the demand for these products is influenced by new and used vehicle sales and the overall economic health of vehicle owners which may be affected by general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending the prices for our specialty vehicle products are based on manufacturers suggested retail prices with discounts applied based on prevailing market conditions customer volumes and promotions that we may offer from time to time 

for the year ended   december 31 2017  re venue from other sources represented approximately 5  of our consolidated sales these other sources include scrap sales bulk sales to mechanical manufacturers including cores and sales of aluminum ingots and sows from our furnace operations we derive scrap metal from several sources including vehicles that have been used in both our wholesale and self service recycling operations and from oems and other entities that contract with us for secure disposal of crush only vehicles other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold 

cost of goods sold 

our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts freight and overhead costs related to the purchasing warehousing and distribution of our inventory including labor facility and equipment costs and depreciation our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors our cost of goods sold for refurbished products includes the price we pay for cores freight and costs to refurbish the parts including direct and indirect labor facility and equipment costs depreciation and other overhead related to our refurbishing operations 

for recycled products our cost of goods sold includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and where applicable auction towing and storage fees prices for salvage vehicles may be impacted by a variety of factors including the number of buyers competing to purchase the vehicles the demand and pricing trends for used vehicles the number of vehicles designated as “total losses” by insurance companies the production level of new vehicles which provides the source from which salvage vehicles ultimately come the age of vehicles at auction and the status of laws regulating bidders or exporters of salvage vehicles from time to time we may also adjust our buying strategy to target vehicles with different attributes for example age level of damage and revenue potential due to changes relating to these factors we have seen the prices we pay for salvage vehicles fluctuate over time our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles our labor and laborrelated costs related to acquisition and dismantling generally account for between 10 and 15 of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle the acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and as a result energy costs are not material 

included in our cost of goods sold for remanufactured products is the price we pay for cores freight and costs to remanufacture the products including direct and indirect labor facility and equipment costs depreciation and other overhead related to our remanufacturing operations 

some of our salvage mechanical products are sold with a standard sixmonth warranty against defects additionally some of our remanufactured engines are sold with a standard threeyear warranty against defects we also provide a limited lifetime warranty for certain of our aftermarket products that is supported by certain of the suppliers of those products we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claims information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses 

other revenue is primarily generated from the hulks and unusable parts of the vehicles we acquire for our wholesale and self service recycled product operations and therefore the costs of these sales include the proportionate share of the price we pay for the salvage vehicles as well as the applicable auction storage and towing fees and internal costs to purchase and dismantle the vehicles our cost of goods sold for other revenue will fluctuate based on the prices paid for salvage vehicles which may be impacted by a variety of factors as discussed above 

expenses 

our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our aftermarket warehouses salvage yards and self service retail facilities these costs include personnel expenses such as wages incentive compensation and employee benefits for plant management and facility and warehouse personnel as well as rent for our facilities and related utilities property taxes and repairs and maintenance the costs included in facility and warehouse expenses do not relate to inventory processing or conversion activities and as such are classified below the gross margin line on our consolidated statements of income 

our distribution expenses primarily include our costs to prepare and deliver our products to our customers included in our distribution expense category are personnel costs such as wages employee benefits and incentive compensation for drivers 

third party freight costs fuel and expenses related to our delivery and transfer trucks including vehicle leases repairs and maintenance and insurance 

our selling and marketing expenses primarily include salary commission and other incentive compensation expenses for sales personnel advertising promotion and marketing costs credit card fees telephone and other communication expenses and bad debt expense personnel costs account for the vast majority of our selling and marketing expenses most of our sales personnel are paid on a commission basis the number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our customers’ needs and increase our sales volume our objective is to continually evaluate our sales force develop and implement training programs and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness 

our general and administrative expenses primarily include the costs of our corporate offices and field support center which provide management treasury accounting legal payroll business development human resources and information systems functions general and administrative expenses include wages benefits stockbased compensation and other incentive compensation for corporate regional and administrative personnel information systems support and maintenance expenses and accounting legal and other professional fees 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related repairs our specialty vehicle operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the first half of the year when vehicle owners tend to install this equipment our aftermarket glass operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the second and third quarters when the demand for automotive replacement glass increases after the winter weather 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition inventory valuation business combinations and goodwill impairment we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue actual results may differ from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize and report revenue from the sale of vehicle products when they are shipped to or picked up by the customers and title has transferred subject to an allowance for estimated returns discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information in instances where a product is returned by a customer the product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment we analyze historical returns and allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates we use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold if actual returns and allowances are higher than our historical experience there would be an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence in addition our customers may earn discounts for prompt payment or may earn a discount or rebate upon achievement of sales volumes we analyze historical and current sales volume activity to estimate and record a liability for any discounts or rebates that we e xpect customers to earn any rebates earned are generally applied as a credit to the customer’s receivable account 

we recognize revenue from the sale of scrap metal other metals and cores when title has transferred which typically occurs upon delivery to the customer 

inventory accounting 

salvage and remanufactured inventory  our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle including auction towing and storage fees as well as expenditures for buying and dismantling vehicles inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facilitys inventory at expected selling prices the assessment of which incorporates the sales probability based on a parts days in stock and historical demand the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facilitys historical profitability for salvage vehicles remanufactured inventory cost is based upon the price paid for cores and also includes expenses incurred for freight direct manufacturing costs and overhead related to our remanufacturing operations 

for all inventory carrying value is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value and is reduced to reflect current anticipated demand if actual demand differs from our estimates additional reductions to inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made 

business combinations 

we record our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values we utilize management estimates and in some instances independent thirdparty valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and contingent consideration granted such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions including projections of future events and operating performance 

goodwill impairment 

we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually when testing goodwill for impairment we are required to evaluate events and circumstances that may affect the performance of the reporting unit and the extent to which the events and circumstances may impact the future cash flows of the reporting unit to determine whether the fair value of the assets exceed the carrying value if these assumptions or estimates change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill 

we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist  during   2017  we did not identify any events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts therefore we did not perform any impairment tests other than our annual test in the fourth quarter of   2017    as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test we were organized into five reporting units wholesale  north america europe specialty self service and aviation our aviation reporting unit resulted from an acquisition of a small wholesale business in north america completed in 2017 

our goodwill would be considered impaired if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value the fair value estimates are established using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach we believe that using two methods to determine fair value limits the chances of an unrepresentative valuation as of december 31 2017  we had a total of 35 billion  in goodwill subject to future impairment tests we determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2017  on all five reporting units we noted that the fair value estimate for the aviation reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by less than 10 this result aligns with our expectations as there has not been a significant change in the value of the business since the acquisition date in march 2017 while we continue to execute our business plan all other reporting units had a fair value estimate which exceeded the carrying value by at least 25 if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results

results of operations—segment reporting 

we have four operating segments wholesale – north america europe specialty and self service our wholesale – north america and self service operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment north america because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services customers and methods of distribution therefore we present three reportable segments north america europe and specialty 

we have presented the growth of our revenue and profitability in our operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis the constant currency presentation which is a nongaap measure excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth and profitability consistent with how we evaluate our performance as this statistic removes the translation impact of exchange rate fluctuations which are outside of our control and do not reflect our operational performance constant currency revenue and segment ebitda results are calculated by translating prior year revenue and segment ebitda in local currency using the current years currency conversion rate this nongaap financial measure has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap our use of this term may vary from the use of similarlytitled measures by other issuers due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation in addition not all companies that report revenue or profitability on a constant currency basis calculate such measures in the same manner as we do and accordingly our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarlynamed measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies

operations the favorable volume impact which was primarily related to mechanical parts was a result of refinements to our buying algorithms also an emphasis on inventorying more parts off of each car purchased contributed to the increase in the number of parts sold per vehicle while we were able to increase parts and services revenue over the prior year we believe the weather conditions in 2017 contributed to a lower growth rate than generated in prior years organic revenue growth for our north america segment was also negatively affected by one fewer selling day in 2017 compared to 2016 on a per day basis organic revenue growth was 34

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes liquidity data as of the dates indicated in thousands 



 we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through both internal development and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our credit facilities we utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures with the excess amounts going towards funding acquisitions or paying down outstanding debt as we have pursued acquisitions as part of our growth strategy our cash flows from operations have not always been sufficient to cover our investing activities to fund our acquisitions we have accessed various forms of debt financing including revolving credit facilities senior notes and a receivables securitization facility 

as of december 31 2017  we had debt outstanding and additional available sources of financing as follows 

 from time to time we may undertake financing transactions to increase our available liquidity such as our december 2017 and january 2016 amendments to our senior secured credit facilities the issuance of €500 million of euro notes 2024 in april 2016 and the november 2016 amendment to our receivables securitization facility our financing structure which includes our senior secured credit facilities senior notes and receivables securitization facility provides financial flexibility to execute our longterm growth strategy if we see an attractive acquisition opportunity we have the ability to use our revolver to move quickly and have certainty of funding up to the amount of our thenavailable liquidity 

 as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 14 billion available under our credit facilities combined with approximately 280 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2017  we had approximately 17 billion in available liquidity an increase of 428 million over our available liquidity as of december 31 2016  the increase in available liquidity in 2017 is primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the sale of the glass manufacturing business in march for 301 million and the december 2017 amendment to the credit facility which increased availability by 300 million 

in december 2017 we signed a definitive agreement to acquire stahlgruber for an enterprise value of €15 billion we intend to finance the acquisition with the proceeds from planned debt offerings borrowings under our existing revolving credit 

facility and the direct issuance to stahlgrubers owner of 8055569 newly issued shares of lkq common stock the timing of the borrowings and the amounts to be drawn from debt offerings and the revolver are to be determined and will depend on the timing of the expected closing of the transaction and market conditions at such time 

we believe that our current liquidity and cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements although such sources may not be sufficient for future acquisitions depending on their size while we believe that we have adequate capacity from time to time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements as noted above regarding the pending stahlgruber transaction there can be no assurance that additional funding or refinancing of our credit facilities if needed will be available on terms attractive to us or at all furthermore any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants or higher interest costs our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at variable rates which are tied to the london interbank offered rate libor or the canadian dollar offered rate cdor depending on the currency and the duration of the borrowing plus an applicable margin rate which is subject to change quarterly based on our reported leverage ratio we hold interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates on a portion of our credit agreement borrowings with the effect of fixing the interest rates on the respective notional amounts in addition in 2016 we entered into cross currency swaps that contain an interest rate swap component and a foreign currency forward contract component that when combined with related intercompany financing arrangements effectively convert variable rate us dollardenominated borrowings into fixed rate eurodenominated borrowings these derivative transactions are described in note 10 derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k after giving effect to these contracts the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2017  was 22  including our senior notes and the borrowings on our receivables securitization program our overall weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 30  at december 31 2017  

cash interest payments were 96 million  for the year ended   december 31 2017  including 50 million in semiannual interest payments as a result of our us notes 2023 and our euro notes 2024 interest payments on our us notes 2023 are made in may and november and interest payments on our euro notes 2024 are scheduled for april and october 

we had outstanding credit agreement borrowings of 20 billion  and 21 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016 respectively of these amounts 18 million and 37 million was classified as current maturities at december 31 2017  and 2016 respectively 

the scheduled maturities of longterm obligations outstanding at december 31 2017  are as follows in thousands 



 our credit agreement contains customary covenants that provide limitations and conditions on our ability to enter into certain transactions the credit agreement also contains financial and affirmative covenants including limitations on our net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our credit agreement as of december 31 2017  

as of december 31 2017  the company had cash and cash equivalents of 280 million  of which 220 million was held by foreign subsidiaries in general it has been our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and that position has not changed following the enactment of the tax act and the related imposition of the transition tax beginning in 2018 distributions of dividends from our foreign subsidiaries will be generally exempt from further us taxation either as a result of the new 100 participation exemption under the tax act or due to the previous taxation of foreign earnings under the transition tax we are still evaluating whether the tax act will affect the company’s existing policy to indefinitely reinvest unremitted foreign earnings 

we believe that we have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our financial obligations in the us without resorting to repatriation of foreign earnings as a result of the tax act we expect to have significantly lower income tax payments in 2018 due to the lower tax rate and the immediate deduction of capital expenditures partially offset by the first payment with respect to the transition tax

we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of distribution centers processing and sales facilities and warehouses through further integration of our facilities and through selected business acquisitions our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions

 foreign exchange rates 

foreign currency fluctuations may impact the financial results we report for the portions of our business that operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar our operations outside of the us represented 418 and 391 of our revenue during 2017 and 2016 respectively an increase or decrease in the strength of the us dollar against these currencies by 10 would result in a 42 change in our consolidated revenue and a 26 change in our operating income for the year ended december 31 2017 see our results of operations discussion in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our year over year results 

additionally we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket products from foreign countries primarily in europe and asia to the extent that our inventory purchases are not denominated in the functional currency of the purchasing location we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in several of our operations we purchase inventory from manufacturers in taiwan in us dollars which exposes us to fluctuations in the relationship between the local functional currency and the us dollar as well as fluctuations between the us dollar and the taiwan dollar we hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations related to a portion of inventory purchases in our europe operations but the notional amount and fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2017 were immaterial we do not currently attempt to hedge foreign currency exposure related to our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in our north america operations and we may not be able to pass on any price increases to our customers 

other than with respect to a portion of our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases we do not hold derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency risk our net investment in foreign operations is partially hedged by the foreign currency denominated borrowings we use to fund foreign acquisitions however our ability to use foreign currency denominated borrowings to finance our foreign operations may be limited based on local tax laws we have elected not to hedge the foreign currency risk related to the interest payments on foreign borrowings as we generate cash flows in the local currencies that can be used to fund debt payments as of december 31 2017 we had outstanding borrowings of €500 million   under our euro notes 2024 and £124 million cad 130 million   sek 250 million  and   €132 million under our revolving credit facilities 

interest rates 

our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facilities where interest rates are tied to the prime rate libor or cdor therefore we implemented a policy to manage our exposure to variable interest rates on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt instruments through the use of interest rate swap contracts these contracts convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt matching the currency effective dates and maturity dates to specific debt instruments net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swap contracts are included as adjustments to interest expense all of our interest rate swap contracts have been executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy wells fargo bank na bank of america na citizens na fifth third bank hsbc bank usa na and banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria sa 

as of december 31 2017 we held ten interest rate swap contracts representing a total of 590 million of us dollardenominated notional amount debt our interest rate swap contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and modify the variable rate nature of that portion of our variable rate debt these swaps have maturity dates ranging from january 2021 through june 2021 as of december 31 2017 the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was an asset of 19 million the values of such contracts are subject to changes in interest rates 

in addition to these interest rate swaps as of december 31 2017 we held three cross currency swap agreements for a total notional amount of 407 million €385 million with maturity dates in january 2021 these cross currency swaps contain an interest rate swap component and a foreign currency forward contract component that combined with related intercompany financing arrangements effectively convert variable rate us dollardenominated borrowings into fixed rate eurodenominated borrowings the swaps are intended to eliminate uncertainty in cash flows in us dollars and euros in connection with intercompany financing arrangements the cross currency swaps were also executed with banks we believe are creditworthy wells fargo bank na bank of america na and the bank of tokyomitsubishi ufj ltd as of december 31 2017 the fair value of the interest rate swap components of the cross currency swaps was an asset of 6 million and the fair 

value of the currency forward components was a liability of 61 million the values of these contracts are subject to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in total we had 48 of our variable rate debt under our credit facilities at fixed rates at december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 see note 9 longterm obligations  and note 10 derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

at december 31 2017 we had 11 billion of variable rate debt that was not hedged using sensitivity analysis a 100 basis point movement in interest rates would change interest expense by 11 million over the next twelve months 

commodity prices 

we are exposed to market risk related to price fluctuations in scrap metal and other metals market prices of these metals affect the amount that we pay for our inventory and the revenue that we generate from sales of these metals as both our revenue and costs are affected by the price fluctuations we have a natural hedge against the changes however there is typically a lag between the effect on our revenue from metal price fluctuations and inventory cost changes and there is no guarantee that the vehicle costs will decrease or increase at the same rate as the metals prices therefore we can experience positive or negative gross margin effects in periods of rising or falling metals prices particularly when such prices move rapidly additionally if market prices were to change at a greater rate than our vehicle acquisition costs we could experience a positive or negative effect on our operating margin the average of scrap metal prices for 2017 has increased 318 over the average for 2016

 item 1   business 

overview 

lkq corporation lkq or the company is a leading provider of alternative and specialty parts to repair and accessorize automobiles and other vehicles lkq has operations in north america europe and taiwan lkq offers its customers a broad range of replacement systems components equipment and parts to repair and accessorize automobiles trucks and recreational and performance vehicles 

buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers oems new products produced by companies other than the oems which are sometimes referred to as aftermarket products recycled products obtained from salvage vehicles used products that have been refurbished and used products that have been remanufactured collectively we refer to the four sources that are not new oem products as alternative parts 

specialty automotive and rv aftermarket accessories and equipment are purchased by consumers to improve the performance functionality and appearance of their vehicles 

we are organized into five operating segments wholesale  north america europe specialty glass and self service we aggregate our wholesale  north america glass and self service operating segments into one reportable segment north america resulting in three reportable segments north america europe and specialty see note 14 segment and geographic information to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for financial information by reportable segment and by geographic region 

history 

lkq was initially formed in 1998 through the combination of a number of wholesale recycled products businesses located in florida michigan ohio and wisconsin we subsequently expanded through internal development and over 235 acquisitions of aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured product suppliers and manufacturers self service retail businesses specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories suppliers and a distributor of automotive glass products our most significant acquisitions include 

 further information regarding our recent acquisitions is included in note 2 business combinations and information related to our discontinued operations is included in note 3 “discontinued operations” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

strategy 

our strategy is to build economic value for our stockholders by enhancing our position as a leading source for alternative collision and mechanical repair products and by expanding into other product lines and businesses that may benefit from our operating strengths we strive to offer our customers the most comprehensive available and cost effective selection of 

part solutions while building strong partnerships with our employees and the communities in which we operate we believe a supply network with a broad inventory of quality alternative collision and mechanical repair products and specialty vehicle aftermarket products high fulfillment rates and superior customer service provides us with a competitive advantage to execute our strategy we are focused on the following key areas 

 north america segment 

our north america segment is composed of wholesale operations which consists of aftermarket and salvage operations and self service retail operations we are a leading provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and a leading provider of alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products with our sales processing and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the us and canada 

wholesale operations 

inventory 

our wholesale automobile product operations in north america sell all five product types aftermarket recycled remanufactured refurbished and oem parts to professional collision and mechanical automobile repair businesses our principal aftermarket product types consist of those most frequently damaged in collisions including bumper covers automotive body panels lights and automotive glass products such as windshields platinum plus is our exclusive product line offered under the keystone brand of aftermarket products certain of our products are certified by independent organizations such as the certified automotive parts association “capa” and nsf international “nsf” capa and nsf are associations that evaluate the quality of aftermarket collision replacement products compared to oem collision replacement products we also developed a product line called value line for more value conscious often selfpay consumers our salvage products include both mechanical and collision parts including engines transmissions door assemblies sheet metal products such as trunk lids fenders and hoods lights and bumper assemblies 

the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from independent manufacturers and distributors located primarily in the us taiwan and china in 2016 approximately 39 of our aftermarket purchases were made from our top four vendors with our largest vendor providing approximately 16 of our annual inventory purchases we believe we are one of the largest customers of each of these suppliers outside of this group no other supplier provided more than 5 of our supply of aftermarket products in 2016 we purchased approximately 48 of our aftermarket products in 2016 directly from 

manufacturers in taiwan and other asian countries approximately 50 of our aftermarket products were purchased from vendors located in the us and canada however we believe the majority of these products were manufactured in taiwan mexico or other foreign countries 

we procure recycled products for our wholesale operations by acquiring total loss vehicles typically sold at regional salvage auctions and then dismantling and inventorying the parts the availability and pricing of the salvage vehicles we procure for our wholesale recycled products operations may be impacted by a variety of factors including the production level of new vehicles and the portion of damaged vehicles declared total losses our bidding specialists are equipped with a proprietary software application that allows our bidding specialist to compare the vehicles at the salvage auctions against our current inventory levels historical demand and recent average selling prices to arrive at an estimated maximum bid 

within our wholesale operations we focus our procurement on products that are in the most demand based on a number of factors such as historical sales records of vehicles by model and year customer requests projections of future supply and demand trends because lead times may take 40 days or more on imported aftermarket products sales volume and instock inventory are important factors in the procurement process 

in our aftermarket operations we use a third party enterprise management system and other third party software packages to leverage the centralized data and information that a single system provides such as a data warehouse to conduct enhanced analytics and reporting an integrated budgeting system an electronic data interchange tool and ecommerce tools to enhance our online businesstobusiness initiatives  orderkeystonecom and keyless 

our wholesale recycled product locations in north america operate an internallydeveloped proprietary enterprise management system called lkqx we believe that the use of a single system across all of our wholesale recycled product operations helps facilitate the sales process allows for continued implementation of standard operating procedures and yields improved training efficiency employee transferability access to our national inventory database management reporting and data storage the system also supports an electronic exchange process for identifying and locating parts at other select recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock 

scrap and other materials 

our salvage operations generate scrap metal and other materials that we sell to metals recyclers vehicles that have been dismantled for recycled products and crush only endoflife vehicles acquired from other companies are typically crushed using equipment on site in other cases we will hire mobile crushing equipment to crush the vehicles before they are transported to shredders and scrap metal processors damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products including wheels we also extract and sell the precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts such as catalytic converters 

customers 

we sell our products to wholesale customers that include collision and mechanical repair shops and new and used car dealerships as well as to retail customers the majority of these customers tend to be individuallyowned small businesses although the number of independent and dealeroperated collision repair facilities has declined over the last decade as regional or national multiple location operators have increased their geographic presence through acquisitions automobile insurance companies affect the demand for our collision products while insurance companies do not pay for our products directly they ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount as a result insurance companies often influence the types of products used in a repair the use of our products provides a direct benefit to insurance companies by lowering the cost of repairs decreasing the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and providing a replacement product that is of high quality and comparable performance to the part replaced 

our sales personnel are encouraged to promote lkq to customers as a “onestop shop” by offering comparable options from our other product lines if the desired part isn’t in stock to support these efforts we have provided our sales staff with access to both recycled and aftermarket sales systems and we have developed sales incentive programs that encourage cross selling throughout our wholesale operations 

to better serve our customers a consolidated approach has been taken for the electronic sale of wholesale products in our north american segment a full suite of ecommerce services is available to approved partners that helps us improve order accuracy reduce return rate and better fit our customer workflow using these services in coordination with our partners products can be searched priced and ordered without leaving the customers own operating systems 

distribution 

we have a distribution network of warehouses and cross dock facilities which allows us to develop and maintain our service levels with local repair shops while providing fulfillment rates that are made possible by our nationwide presence our delivery fleet utilizes a third party software provider to optimize delivery routes and to track the progress of delivery vehicles throughout their runs our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries as required by our customers using drivers who 

routinely deliver to the same customers our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network we operate a delivery fleet of mediumsized trucks and smaller trucks and vans which deliver multiple product types on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs and improve customer service 

competition 

we consider all suppliers of vehicle collision and mechanical products to be competitors including aftermarket suppliers recycling businesses refurbishing operations parts remanufacturers oems and internetbased suppliers we compete with alternative parts distributors on the basis of our nationwide distribution system our product lines and inventory availability customer service our relationships with insurance companies and to a lesser extent price we compete with oems primarily on the basis of price and to a lesser extent on service and product quality we do not consider retail chains that focus on the doityourself market to be our direct competitors   since many of our wholesale product sales are paid for by insurance companies rather than the end user 

self service operations 

our self service retail operations most of which operate under the name “lkq pick your part” sell parts from endoflife vehicles directly to consumers in addition to revenue from the sale of parts core and scrap we charge a nominal admission fee to access the property 

inventory 

we acquire inventory for our self service retail product operations from a variety of sources including but not limited to towing companies auctions the general public municipality sales insurance carriers and charitable organizations we typically procure salvage vehicles that are more than seven model years old for our self service retail product operations these vehicles are generally older and of lower quality than the salvage vehicles we purchase for our wholesale recycled product operations vehicles are delivered to our locations by the seller or we arrange for transportation once on our property minimal labor is required to process the vehicle other than removing the battery fluids refrigerants catalytic converters and hazardous materials the extracted fluids are stored in bulk and subsequently sold to recyclers in the case of gasoline the fuel retrieved is primarily used to power our delivery vehicles vehicles are then placed in the yard for customers to remove parts in our self service business availability of a specific part will depend on which vehicles are currently at the site and to what extent parts may have been previously sold we usually keep a vehicle at our facility for 30 to 120 days depending on the capacity of the yard and size of the market before it is crushed and sold to scrap metal processors 

scrap and other materials 

our self service operations generate scrap metal alloys and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that we no longer make available to the public and crush only vehicles acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site 

customers 

the customers of our self service yards are frequently doityourself mechanics small independent repair shops servicing older vehicles auto rebuilders and resellers the scrap from the vehicle hulks when not processed by us is sold to metals recyclers with whom we may also compete when procuring salvage vehicles for our operations 

competition 

there are competitors operating self service businesses in all of the markets in which we operate in some markets there are numerous competitors often operating in close proximity to our operations we try to differentiate our business by the quality of the inventory and the size and cleanliness of the property 

europe segment 

as noted in the history section the europe segment was built on three key acquisitions ecp 2011 sator 2013 and rhiag 2016 our rhiag acquisition provides a potential platform to capitalize on the large and fragmented aftermarket mechanical replacement parts market in europe and also complements our existing operations in the uk and the benelux region given the significant overlap in suppliers and product mix which allows for potential cost savings from the leveraging of our combined purchasing power in 2014 we expanded our european segment to include wholesale recycling operations through our acquisition of a business with salvage and vehicle repair facilities in sweden and norway in addition to expanding our geographic presence in europe we believe these acquisitions provide us with the opportunity to leverage our experience in operating salvage facilities in a new market and to expand our aftermarket operations to include these countries in december 2016 we acquired an equity investment in mekonomen ab mekonomen the leading independent car parts and service 

chain in the nordic region of europe mekonomen will remain independent of our existing european operations but we plan to explore areas where the companies can work together in a mutually beneficial manner we have acquired many smaller businesses within these regions and over time we anticipate further integration of our european operations as we optimize purchasing warehousing cataloging logistics and backoffice functions 

inventory 

our inventory is primarily composed of mechanical aftermarket parts for the repair of vehicles 3 to 15 years old our top selling products include brake pads discs and sensors clutches electrical products such as spark plugs and batteries steering and suspension products filters and oil and automotive fluids in addition to mechanical aftermarket parts we also sell collision parts in our europe operations we believe the historically low alternative collision parts usage percentage in europe provides an opportunity for us in this segment particularly as insurance companies look to lower their costs 

in 2016 our top five suppliers represented 22 of our aftermarket inventory purchases with each of our top two suppliers representing approximately 6 of our purchases no other suppliers comprised a significant portion of our purchases during 2016 the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from vendors located primarily in the uk and continental europe in 2016 we purchased 92 of our products from companies in europe the remaining 8 of our 2016 purchases were sourced from vendors located primarily in china or taiwan some of which also supply collision parts for our wholesale  north america operations in 2016 57 29 and 8 of our total inventory purchases were made in euros pounds sterling and us dollars respectively 

our aftermarket operations in the uk use a single integrated it platform for our purchasing branch stock and finance activities which are further supported by a national distribution center system to manage inventory movement the it system allows customers to identify the correct part for repairs thereby improving customer satisfaction and reducing return rates our aftermarket operations in continental europe use several it systems which are linked to transfer data between systems to manage customer orders and inventory movement and for financial reporting purposes certain of our it systems can interface with our repair shop customers respective it systems which enables them to identify the part required for the repair 

in our scandinavia operations we purchase severely damaged or totaled vehicles from insurance companies which are transferred to our dismantling facilities or sold to other third party dismantlers 

customers 

we operate under both twostep ie direct sales to customers and threestep ie sales to distributors who in turn sell to customers distribution models in europe in our twostep operations such as the uk and czech republic we sell the majority of our products to commercial customers primarily consisting of professional repairers including both independent mechanical repair shops and collision repair shops in our threestep operations such as italy belgium and switzerland we sell products to wholesale distributors or jobbers historically our distribution network in the benelux region operated under a threestep distribution model where the immediate customers were warehouse distributors since the second quarter of 2014 we have acquired a number of aftermarket parts distributors in the netherlands which has enabled us to transform the original distribution model in this region to a twostep distribution model in addition to our sales to repair shops and wholesale distributors we generate a portion of our revenue through sales to retail customers from ecp’s ecommerce platform and from counter sales at the branch locations

our european operations employ a distribution model in which inventory is stored at regional distribution centers or hubs with fast moving product stored at branch locations or at local warehouse distributors for some of our netherlands italy and check republic operations for timely delivery to the repair shop customers product is moved through the distribution network on our vans or via common carrier in our uk operations we also sometimes employ a third party motorcycle fleet to deliver parts from our branch locations to nearby repair shop customers 

in the uk we have undertaken a major project to expand our distribution capabilities by building a new national distribution center in tamworth which is expected to be completed in 2018 between now and completion we will incur some duplicate operating and other startup costs which may be material as a result of having multiple warehouses during the build out phase 

competition 

we view all suppliers of replacement repair products as our competitors including other alternative parts suppliers and oems and their dealer networks while we compete with all alternative parts suppliers there are few with national distribution networks like ours that can reach the majority of repair shop customers within the required delivery time in their respective markets we believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other alternative parts suppliers primarily through our distribution network efficient stock management systems and proprietary technology which allows us to deliver our products 

quickly as well as through our product lines and inventory availability pricing and service we compete with oems primarily on the basis of price service and availability 

specialty segment 

our specialty operating segment was formed in 2014 with our acquisition of keystone specialty a leading distributor and marketer of specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories in north america our specialty operations reach most major markets in the us and canada and serve the following six product segments truck and offroad speed and performance rv towing wheels tires and performance handling and miscellaneous accessories 

inventory   

the specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories we distribute are purchased from suppliers located primarily in the us canada and china our top selling products are rv appliances  air conditioners towing hitches truck bed covers vehicle protection products cargo management products and wheels tires  suspension products specialty aftermarket suppliers are typically small to mediumsized independent businesses that focus on a narrow product or market niche due to the highly fragmented supplier base for specialty vehicle aftermarket products we have limited supplier concentration in 2016 approximately 24 of our specialty vehicle aftermarket purchases were made from our top five suppliers with our largest vendor providing approximately 8 of our annual inventory purchases 

our specialty operations utilize an internally developed inventory management and order entry system that interfaces with third party software systems for accounting transaction processing data analytics and reporting 

customers 

overall the specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and accessories market contains a fragmented customer base composed of rv and specialty automotive dealers installers jobbers builders parts chains and mailorder businesses our customers are principally small independent businesses these customers depend on us to provide a broad range of products rapid delivery marketing support and technical assistance in addition to traditional customers in recent years we have increased sales to several large parts and accessory online retailers our specialty segment also operates retail stores in northeast pennsylvania 

we promote our products to customers through marketing programs which include catalogs advertising sponsorships and promotional activities product level marketing and merchandising support and online initiatives our national footprint allows us to stage trade shows across the us which provide an opportunity to improve sales through the showcasing of new and innovative products from our vendors to our customers 

online sales of our specialty products take place through our ekeystonecom and viantpcom sites these sites provide customers i the ability to match products with the make and model of car thus allowing the customer to order the right part ii the product information eg pictures attributes available for review and iii the convenience of searching inventory availability and ordering the product on the site additionally the site can provide sales opportunities by suggesting other parts to purchase based on an inquiry submitted by the customer 

distribution 

our specialty segment operations employ a hubandspoke distribution model which enables us to transport products from our primary distribution centers to our noninventory stocking cross docks a majority of which are colocated with our north america wholesale operations and provide distribution points to key regional markets and synergies with our existing infrastructure we believe this provides added value to our customers through a broader product offering and more efficient distribution process we use our delivery routes to provide multiday per week delivery and returns of our products directly to and from our customers in all 48 continental us states and 9 canadian provinces and we ship globally to customers in other countries our delivery fleet utilizes a third party software provider to optimize delivery routes and to track the progress of delivery vehicles throughout their runs 

competition 

industry participants have a variety of supply choices vendors can deliver products to market via warehouse distributors and mail order catalog businesses or directly to retailers andor consumers we view all suppliers of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories as our competitors while we compete with all specialty vehicle aftermarket parts suppliers there are few with national distribution networks like lkq’s that can reach the majority of customers within the optimum delivery time we believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and equipment suppliers primarily through our broad product selection which encompasses both popular and hardtofind products our distribution network and efficient inventory management systems as well as through our service we compete on the basis of product breadth and depth rapid and dependable delivery marketing initiatives support services and price 

intellectual property 

we own various trade names and trademarks as a result of past acquisitions in addition to acquired trade names and trademarks we also have technologybased intellectual property that has been both internally developed and obtained through license agreements we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any single or group of related trademarks licenses or registrations nor would the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property license agreement materially affect our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2016 we employed approximately 42500 persons which includes approximately 3000 persons employed by pgws glass manufacturing business that we expect to sell in the first quarter of 2017 of the approximately 39500 employees of our continuing operations approximately 20500 were employed in north america and approximately 19000 were employed outside of north america of our employees in north america associated with continuing operations approximately 1370 were represented by unions outside of north america we have governmentmandated collective bargaining agreements and union contracts in certain countries particularly in europe where many of our employees are represented by unions andor works councils we consider our employee relations to be good 

facilities 

our continuing operations include 1339 facilities including 548 facilities in the us and 791 facilities located in 20 other countries most of which are leased many of our locations stock multiple product types or serve more than one function 

our corporate headquarters are located at 500 west madison street chicago illinois 60661 we operate a field support center in nashville tennessee that performs certain centralized functions for our north american operations including accounting procurement and information systems support in 2017 we announced our plans to expand the size of our field support center via construction of a new 100000 square foot facility in nashville our specialty operations maintain primary procurement accounting and finance functions in exeter pennsylvania certain backoffice support functions for our segments are performed in bangalore india our european operations maintain procurement accounting and finance functions in wembley outside of london england and tamworth england in schiedam the netherlands in milan italy and in prague czech republic in addition to these offices we have a 500000 square foot national distribution center in tamworth that houses inventory to supply the hubs and branches of our uk operations we are in the process of constructing a second national distribution center in tamworth we expect the 750000 square foot facility will be fully operational by 2018 additionally we operate an aftermarket parts warehouse in taiwan to aggregate inventory for shipment to our locations in north america 

regulation 

    our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment in the us and the other countries in which we operate see the risk factor “we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters” in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding the effects of environmental laws and regulations on us 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related repairs our specialty vehicle operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the first half of the year when vehicle owners tend to install this equipment we expect our aftermarket glass operations to generate greater revenue and earnings in the second and third quarters when the demand for glass replacements increases after the winter weather 




 item 1a risk factors 

our operating results and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the economic and political conditions in the us and elsewhere 

changes in economic and political conditions in the us and other countries in which we are located or do business could have a material effect on our company changes in such conditions have in some periods resulted in fewer miles driven fewer accident claims and a reduction of vehicle repairs all of which could negatively affect our business the number of new vehicles produced and sold by manufacturers affects our business a decrease in the number of vehicles on the road results in a decrease in accidents requiring repairs moreover we supply vehicle glass directly to vehicle manufacturers and a decrease in the number of vehicles produced would result in a decrease in the demand for our glass products 

our sales are also impacted by changes to the economic health of vehicle owners the economic health of vehicle owners is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit taxation fuel prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside of our control if any of these conditions worsen our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities and hedge transactions these unfavorable events affecting our business partners could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we have a substantial business presence in europe including a significant presence in the united kingdom in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom decided by referendum to withdraw from the european union the precise timing and impacts of this action on our businesses in the united kingdom and other parts of europe are unknown at this time since the vote we have seen fluctuations in exchange rates leading to pricing pressures and unfavorable translation effects on our sterling denominated earnings as the details of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union are negotiated and implemented our european businesses could be adversely affected as a result of further fluctuations in exchange rates disruptions to access to markets by united kingdom companies interruptions of the movement of goods and services between countries a decrease of economic activity in europe and political or social unrest 

we face intense competition from local national international and internetbased vehicle products providers and this competition could negatively affect our business 

the vehicle replacement products industry is highly competitive and is served by numerous suppliers of oem recycled aftermarket refurbished and remanufactured products within each of these categories of suppliers there are local owneroperated companies larger regional suppliers national and international providers and internetbased suppliers providers of vehicle replacement products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of vehicle replacement products which may further increase competition some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise greater financial technical manufacturing distribution and other resources longer operating histories lower cost structures and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries or with consumers than we do in certain regions of the us local vehicle recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in the wholesale recycled products industry similarly in europe some local companies are part of cooperative efforts to compete in the aftermarket parts industry as a result of these factors our competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply provide their products at lower costs or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve 

we believe that a majority of collision parts by dollar amount are supplied by oems with the balance being supplied by distributors of alternative aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured collision parts like us the oems are therefore able to exert pricing pressure in the marketplace we compete with the oems primarily on price and to a lesser extent on service and quality from time to time the oems have implemented programs seeking to increase their market share in the collision repair parts industry for example they have reduced prices on specific products to match the lower prices of alternative products and introduced other rebate programs that may disrupt our sales the growth of these programs or the introduction of new ones could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we rely upon our customers and insurance companies to promote the usage of alternative parts 

our success depends in part on the acceptance and promotion of alternative collision parts usage by automotive insurance companies there can be no assurance that current levels of alternative parts usage will be maintained or will increase in the future alternative part usage in the us has been relatively flat over the last three years in addition in some places we operate alternative parts usage is relatively low 

we also rely on business relationships with insurance companies these insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide the business relationships include in some cases participation in aftermarket quality and service assurance programs that may result in a higher usage of our aftermarket products than would be the case without the programs our arrangements with these companies may be terminated by them at any time including in connection with their own business concerns relating to the offering availability standards or operations of the aftermarket quality and service assurance programs we rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in an illinois lawsuit involving state farm mutual automobile insurance company avery v state farm a jury decided in october 1999 that state farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using nonoem replacement products to repair damaged vehicles when use of such products did not restore the vehicle to its preloss 

condition the jury found that state farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of nonoem replacement products and the alleged inferiority of those products the jury assessed damages against state farm of 456 million and the judge assessed an additional 730 million of disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the illinois consumer fraud act in april 2001 the illinois appellate court upheld the verdict but reduced the damage award by 130 million because of duplicative damage awards on august 18 2005 the illinois supreme court reversed the awards made by the circuit court and found among other things that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any breach of contract by state farm the us supreme court declined to hear an appeal of this case as a result of this case some insurance companies reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket products our financial results could be adversely affected if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled products from us due to a fear of similar claims 

in addition to the extent that the collision repair industry continues to consolidate the buying power of collision repair shop customers may further increase putting additional pressure on our financial returns 

we may not be able to successfully acquire new businesses or integrate acquisitions which could cause our business to suffer 

we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms if we do not obtain antitrust or other regulatory approvals on applicable terms or for other reasons moreover we may not be able to identify a sufficient number of acquisition candidates at reasonable prices to maintain our growth objectives also over time we will likely seek to make acquisitions that are relatively larger as we grow larger acquisition candidates may attract additional competitive buyers which could increase our cost or could cause us to lose such acquisitions 

if we buy a company or a division of a company we may experience difficulty integrating that companys or divisions personnel and operations which could negatively affect our operating results in addition 

 claims by oems relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business 

oems and other manufacturers have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims the oems have brought such claims in federal court and with the us international trade commission 

to the extent oems and other manufacturers are seeking and obtaining more design patents than they have in the past and are successful in asserting infringement of these patents and defending their validity we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business we will likely incur significant expenses investigating and defending intellectual property infringement claims in addition aftermarket products certifying organizations may revoke the certification of parts that are the subject of the claims lack of certification may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of aftermarket products only if they have been certified by an independent certifying organization 

in december 2005 and may 2008 ford global technologies llc filed complaints with the international trade commission against us and others alleging that certain aftermarket products imported into the us infringed on ford design patents the parties settled these matters in april 2009 pursuant to a patent license arrangement that is currently scheduled to expire in march 2020 in january 2014 chrysler group llc filed a complaint against us in the us district court in the 

eastern district of michigan contending that certain aftermarket parts we sell infringe chrysler design patents the parties settled this matter in june 2014 pursuant to a patent license arrangement that expires in june 2019 in the event that these license arrangements or other similar license arrangements with oems are terminated or we are unable to agree upon renewal terms we may be subject to costs and uncertainties of litigation as well as restrictions on our ability to sell aftermarket parts that replicate parts covered by design patents 

if the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines or the number of cars being repaired declines our business could suffer 

our business depends on vehicle accidents and mechanical failures for both the demand for repairs using our products and the supply of recycled remanufactured and refurbished parts to the extent that a relatively higher percentage of damaged vehicles are declared total losses there will be less demand for our products to repair such vehicles in addition our business is impacted by factors which influence the number andor severity of accidents and mechanical failures including but not limited to the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven the ages of drivers the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions the congestion of traffic drivers distracted by electronic equipment the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers the effectiveness of accident avoidance systems in new vehicles the reliability of new oem parts and the condition of roadways for example an increase of the acceptance of the ridesharing business model would reduce the number of vehicles on the road additionally an increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the need for mechanical repairs and maintenance to decline as motorists seek alternative transportation options mild weather conditions particularly during winter months tend to result in a decrease in vehicle accidents moreover a number of states and municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones or other electronic devices while driving and such restrictions could lead to a decline in accidents 

systems designed to help drivers avoid accidents are becoming more prevalent and more technologically sophisticated to the extent oems install or are mandated by law to install accident avoidance systems in their vehicles the number and severity of accidents could decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the average number of new vehicles sold annually has fluctuated from yeartoyear periods of decreased sales could result in a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road and consequently fewer vehicles involved in accidents or in need of mechanical repair or maintenance substantial further declines in automotive sales in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition in addition if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of older vehicles on the road insurance companies may find it uneconomical to repair such vehicles or there could be less costly repairs if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of newer vehicles on the road the demand generally for mechanical repairs and maintenance would likely decline due to the newer longerlasting parts in the vehicle population and mechanical failures being covered by oem warranties for the first years of a vehicles life moreover alternative collision and mechanical parts are less likely to be used on newer vehicles electric vehicles do not have traditional engines our biggest selling product thus an increase in electric vehicles as a percentage of vehicles sold will have a negative impact on our engine sales 

fluctuations in the prices of metals and other commodities could adversely affect our financial results 

our recycling operations generate scrap metal and other metals that we sell after we dismantle a salvage vehicle for wholesale parts and after vehicles have been processed in our self service retail business the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors and other remaining metals are sold to processors and brokers of metals in addition we receive crush only vehicles from other companies including oems which we dismantle and which generate scrap metal and other metals the prices of scrap and other metals have historically fluctuated sometimes significantly due to market factors in addition buyers may stop purchasing metals entirely due to excess supply to the extent that the prices of metals decrease materially or buyers stop purchasing metals our revenue from such sales will suffer and a writedown of our inventory value could be required the cost of our wholesale recycled and our self service retail inventory purchases will change as a result of fluctuating scrap metal and other metals prices in a period of falling metal prices there can be no assurance that our inventory purchasing cost will decrease the same amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal and other metals prices decline and there may be a delay between the scrap metal and other metals price reductions and any inventory cost reductions the prices of steel aluminum and plastics are components of the cost to manufacture products for our aftermarket business if the prices of commodities rise and result in higher costs to us for products we sell we may not be able to pass these higher costs on to our customers 

existing or new laws and regulations may prohibit restrict or burden the sale of aftermarket recycled refurbished or remanufactured products 

most states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair work these laws include requirements relating to consumer disclosure vehicle owner’s consent regarding the use of aftermarket products in the repair process and the requirement to have aftermarket products certified by an independent testing organization additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future if additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business 

certain organizations test the quality and safety of vehicle replacement products if these organizations decide not to test a particular vehicle product or in the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product such events could adversely affect our business 

some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled products the passage of legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on our business additionally congress could enact federal legislation restricting the use of aftermarket or recycled automotive products used in the course of vehicle repairs 

the federal trade commission ftc has issued guides which regulate the use of certain terms such as “rebuilt” or “remanufactured” in connection with the sale of automotive parts restrictions on the products we are able to sell and on the marketing of such products could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any covered major part the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on vehicle recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may discourage the use by such shops of recycled products there is no pending initiative to implement the parts registration from a law enforcement point of view however there is a risk that a heightened legislative concern over safety of parts might precipitate an effort to push for the implementation of such rules 

an adverse change in our relationships with our suppliers or auction companies or a disruption to our supply of inventory could increase our expenses and impede our ability to serve our customers 

our business is dependent on a relatively small number of suppliers of aftermarket products a large portion of which are sourced from taiwan we incur substantial freight costs to import parts from our suppliers many of which are located in asia if the cost of freight rose we might not be able to pass the cost increases on to our customers furthermore although alternative suppliers exist for substantially all aftermarket products distributed by us the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on us until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced providing products in addition we are subject to disruptions from work stoppages and other labor disputes at port facilities through which we import our inventory moreover our operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad including among other things natural disasters transportation costs and delays political instability currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs import and export controls and other nontariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas as well as the uncertainty regarding future relations between china japan and taiwan the current us administration has discussed the implementation of a tariff on imports into the us the imposition of which would likely have a negative impact on our business due to the amount of inventory we import 

because a substantial volume of our sales involves products manufactured from sheet metal we can be adversely impacted if sheet metal becomes unavailable or is only available at higher prices which we may not be able to pass on to our customers additionally as oems convert to raw materials other than steel it may be more difficult or expensive to source aftermarket parts made with such materials and it may be more difficult for repair shops to work with such materials in the repair process 

most of our salvage and a portion of our self service inventory is obtained from vehicles offered at salvage auctions operated by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the us we do not typically have contracts with the auction companies according to industry analysts a small number of companies control a large percentage of the salvage auction market in the us if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions began competing with us or significantly raised its fees our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers moreover we face competition in the purchase of vehicles from direct competitors rebuilders exporters and other bidders to the extent that the number of bidders increases it may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold for wholesale recycled products some states regulate bidders to help ensure that salvage vehicles are purchased for legal purposes by qualified buyers auction companies have been actively seeking to reduce circumvent or eliminate these regulations which would further increase the number of bidders 

in addition there is a limited supply of salvage vehicles in the us as we grow and our demand for salvage vehicles increases the costs of these incremental vehicles could be higher in some states when a vehicle is deemed a total loss a 

salvage title is issued whether states issue salvage titles is important to the supply of inventory for the vehicle recycling industry because an increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles currently these titling issues are a matter of state law in 1992 the us congress commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle titling registration and salvage since then legislation has been introduced seeking to establish national uniform requirements in this area including a uniform definition of a salvage vehicle the vehicle recycling industry will generally favor a uniform definition since it will avoid inconsistencies across state lines and will generally favor a definition that expands the number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage however certain interest groups including repair shops and some insurance associations may oppose this type of legislation national legislation has not yet been enacted in this area and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in the future 

we also acquire inventory directly from insurance companies oems and others to the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue these arrangements our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control future factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to those listed in the special note on forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k accordingly our results of operations may not be indicative of future performance these fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below our published financial guidance and the expectations of public markets which could cause our stock price or the value of our debt instruments to decline 

if we lose our key management personnel we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives if we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel which could harm our business 

we operate in foreign jurisdictions which exposes us to foreign exchange and other risks 

we have operations in north america europe taiwan and china and we may expand our operations in the countries in which we do business and into other countries our foreign operations expose us to additional risks associated with international business which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition including import and export requirements and compliance with anticorruption laws such as the uk bribery act 2010 and the foreign corrupt practices act we also incur costs in currencies other than our functional currencies in some of the countries in which we operate we are thus subject to foreign exchange exposure to the extent that we operate in different currencies as well as exposure to foreign tax and other foreign and domestic laws in addition certain countries in which we operate have a higher level of political instability and criminal activity relative to the us that could affect our operations and the ability to maintain our supply of products 

if we determine that our goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired we may incur significant charges to our pretax income 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations in the future goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of acquisitions goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses increases in our cost of capital adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including modifications that restrict the activities of the acquired business as of december 31 2016 our total goodwill subject to future impairment testing was 31 billion  for further discussion of our annual impairment test see goodwill impairment in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of item 7 in this annual report on form 10k 

we amortize other intangible assets over the assigned useful lives each of which is based upon the expected period to be benefited we review other intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in the event conditions change that affect our ability to realize the underlying cash flows associated with our intangible assets we may record an impairment charge as of december 31 2016 the value of our other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization was 584 million  

our business may be adversely affected by union activities and labor and employment laws 

certain of our employees are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining or similar agreements which are subject to periodic renegotiation from time to time there have been efforts to organize additional portions of our workforce and those efforts can be expected to continue in addition the us department of labor or applicable foreign government agencies could adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations that could make it significantly easier for unionization efforts to be successful also we may in the future be subject to strikes or work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disruptions and disputes additional unionization efforts new collective bargaining agreements and work stoppages could materially increase our costs and reduce revenue and could limit our flexibility in terms of work schedules reductions in force and other operational matters 

we also are subject to federal and state laws and regulations such as the fair labor standards act that govern such matters as minimum wage overtime and other working conditions some of these laws are technical in nature and could be subject to interpretation by government agencies different than our interpretations efforts to comply with existing laws changes to such laws and newlyenacted laws may increase our labor costs if we were found not to be in compliance with such laws we could be subject to fines penalties and liabilities to our employees or government agencies 

we rely on information technology and communication systems in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business 

some of the information technology systems and communication systems we use for management of our facilities and our financial functions are leased from or operated by other companies while others are owned by us in the event that the providers of these systems terminate their relationships with us or if we suffer prolonged outages of these or our own systems for whatever reason we could suffer disruptions to our operations 

in the event that we decide to switch providers or to implement upgrades or replacements to our own systems we may also suffer disruptions to our business we may be unsuccessful in the development of our own systems and we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing our own systems also our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system which period could extend longer than we anticipated 

we believe we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect our information systems and personal information about our customers and employees however if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to damage to our reputation additional costs lost sales or possible regulatory action the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly changing and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to our systems and personal data are adequate to safeguard against all security breaches and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our operations the function of our computer systems andor the availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in the closure of our distribution centers “dc”s or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory through our system on a timely basis this may affect our ability to serve our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the us or into the other countries in which we operate and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials we have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements we cannot assure you however that we will at all times be in complete compliance with such requirements 

we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future 

under certain environmental laws we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at or migration to or from our or our predecessors past or present facilities and at independent waste disposal sites these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or was not responsible for the release of such hazardous substances many of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use that may have involved hazardous materials as a result some of our properties may be contaminated some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination these environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of treats or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties or successors to such owners or operators for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 

contamination resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release storage transportation or disposal of gasoline motor oil antifreeze transmission fluid chlorofluorocarbons cfcs from air conditioners other hazardous materials or metals such as aluminum cadmium chromium lead and mercury contamination from the refurbishment of chrome plated bumpers can occur from the release of the plating material contamination can migrate onsite or offsite which can increase the risk and the amount of any potential liability 

when we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process we analyze the risks and when appropriate perform further environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination furthermore where appropriate we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters in the event we discover new information or if laws change we may incur significant liabilities which may exceed our reserves 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we could be subject to product liability claims and involved in product recalls 

if customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage we could be subject to product liability claims by such customers the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we may become involved in the recall of a product that is determined to be defective the expenses of a recall and the damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have agreed to defend and indemnify in certain circumstances insurance companies and customers against claims and damages relating to product liability and product recalls the existence of claims or damages for which we must defend and indemnify these parties could also negatively impact our business results of operations or financial condition 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits 

our operating subsidiaries in our salvage selfservice and refurbishing operations must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations when we develop or acquire a new facility we must seek the approval of state and local units of government governmental agencies may resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling or refurbishing facility in their communities there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold 

new regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and otherwise adversely impact our business  

in august 2012 as mandated by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec adopted final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals originating from the democratic republic of congo drc or adjoining countries these new requirements impose significant burdens on us public companies compliance with the rules requires substantial due diligence in an effort to determine whether products contain the conflict minerals the results of such due diligence efforts must be disclosed on an annual basis in a filing with the sec 

our supply chain is complex and we may incur significant costs to determine the source of any such minerals used in our products we may also incur costs with respect to potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of our diligence activities further the implementation of these rules and their effect on customer supplier andor consumer behavior could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering products free of conflict minerals in some circumstances we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary products from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may face 

reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflictfree or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement accordingly these rules could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition 

if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks our business could be harmed 

we use a fleet of trucks to deliver the majority of the products we sell we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in the transportation infrastructure governmental regulation availability and price of fuel liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance and insurance premium increases in addition our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks relating to our common stock and financial structure 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline additionally the market price for our common stock has been in the past and in the future may be adversely affected by allegations made or reports issued by short sellers analysts activists or others regarding our business model our management or our financial accounting 

following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

delaware law our charter documents and our loan documents may impede or discourage a takeover which could affect the price of our stock 

the antitakeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws our loan documents and delaware law could together or separately impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult our credit agreement provides that a change of control is an event of default our incorporation under delaware law and these provisions could also impede an acquisition takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the price of our common stock 

future sales of our common stock or other securities may depress our stock price 

we and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock or other equity debt or instruments which constitute an element of our debt and equity collectively securities in the future we may also issue shares of common stock under our equity incentive plan or in connection with future acquisitions we cannot predict the size of future issuances of securities or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock or other securities will have on the price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued in connection with an acquisition the issuance of additional debt securities or the perception that such sales or issuances could occur may cause the price of our common stock to fall 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to react to changes in our business 

as of december 31 2016 we had approximately 22 billion aggregate principal amount of secured debt outstanding and approximately 11 billion of availability under the senior secured credit facilities without giving effect to approximately 727 million  of letters of credit outstanding in addition we had approximately 11 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured debt outstanding comprising 600 million  aggregate principal amount of the 475 senior notes due 2023 the us notes and €500 million  526 million  aggregate principal amount of the senior notes due april 1 2024 the euro notes and together with the us notes the senior notes 

our significant amount of debt and our debt service obligations could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations limit our ability to operate our business and impair our competitive position 

for example our debt and our debt service obligations could 

 in addition if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the ability to service such debt would increase 

our senior notes do not impose any limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or protect against certain other types of transactions 

although we are subject to our senior secured credit facilities for so long as they remain in effect the indenture governing the us notes and the indenture governing the euro notes do not restrict the future incurrence of unsecured indebtedness guarantees or other obligations the indentures contain certain limitations on our ability to incur liens on assets and engage in sale and leaseback transactions however these limitations are subject to important exceptions in addition the indentures do not contain many other restrictions including certain restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities including without limitation investments or prepaying subordinated indebtedness or engaging in transactions with our affiliates 

our senior secured credit facilities will permit subject to specified conditions and limitations the incurrence of a significant amount of additional indebtedness as of december 31 2016 we would have been able to incur an additional 11 billion of indebtedness under our revolving credit facility without giving effect to approximately 727 million  of outstanding letters of credit if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the ability to service such debt would increase 

our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability among other things to 

 as a result of these covenants and restrictions we will be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit agreement a default if not waived could result in acceleration of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing credit facilities or it may be on terms that are not acceptable to us 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due any future refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations additionally the senior secured credit facilities and the indentures that govern our senior notes limit the use of the proceeds from certain dispositions of our assets as a result our senior secured credit facilities and our senior notes may prevent us from using the proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all of our debt service obligations 

in addition we are a holding company and repayment of our indebtedness is dependent upon cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are borrowers or guarantors of the indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries and under certain circumstances distributions from our subsidiaries may be subject to significant taxes that reduce the amount of such distributions available to us in the event that we do not receive sufficient distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our future capital needs may require that we seek to refinance our debt or obtain additional debt or equity financing events that could have a negative effect on our business 

we may need to raise additional funds in the future to among other things refinance existing debt fund our existing operations improve or expand our operations respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions from time to time we may raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic alliances or other arrangements funds may not be available or available on terms acceptable to us as a result of different factors including but not limited to turmoil in the credit markets that results in the tightening of credit conditions and current or future regulations applicable to the financial institutions from whom we seek financing if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and further limitations on our operations if we refinance or restructure our debt we may incur charges to write off the unamortized portion of deferred debt issuance costs from a previous financing or we may incur charges related to hedge ineffectiveness from our interest rate swap obligations in addition there are restrictions in the indenture that governs the us notes on our ability to refinance such notes prior to 2018 there are also restrictions in the indenture that governs the euro notes on our ability to refinance such notes prior to 2024 if we fail to raise capital when needed our business may be negatively affected 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly and could affect the value of our senior notes 

certain borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and the borrowing under our accounts receivable securitization facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness would correspondingly decrease moreover changes in market interest rates could affect the trading value of the notes assuming all revolving loans were fully drawn and no interest rate swaps were in place each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in a 328 million change in annual cash interest expense under our senior secured credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization facility 

repayment of our indebtedness including our senior notes is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries 

we are a holding company and repayment of our senior notes will be dependent upon cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are guarantors of the notes our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the notes or to make funds available 

for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness including the notes each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries while the indentures governing the notes limit the ability of our subsidiaries to restrict the payment of dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness including the notes 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our senior notes 

credit ratings have an important effect on our cost of capital credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include among other items our results of operations business decisions that we make their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading we believe our current credit ratings enhance our ability to borrow funds at favorable rates a downgrade in our current credit rating from a rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facilities a downgrade could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our senior notes preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future or incur other indebtedness upon favorable terms 

  the right to receive payments on the senior notes is effectively junior to those lenders who have a security interest in our assets 

our obligations under our senior notes and our guarantors’ obligations under their guarantees of the notes are unsecured but our and each coborrower’s obligations under our senior secured credit facilities and each guarantor’s obligations under their respective guarantees of the senior secured credit facilities are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our domestic tangible and intangible assets including the stock of most of our whollyowned united states subsidiaries and the stock of certain of our nonunited states subsidiaries if we are declared bankrupt or insolvent or if we default under our senior secured credit facilities the lenders could declare all of the funds borrowed thereunder together with accrued interest immediately due and payable if we were unable to repay such indebtedness the lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets to the exclusion of holders of our notes even if an event of default exists under the applicable indenture governing the notes furthermore if the lenders foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any subsidiary guarantor under our notes then that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the notes automatically and immediately upon such sale in any such event because the notes are not secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in subsidiary guarantors it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from which claims by holders of the notes could be satisfied or if any assets remained they might be insufficient to satisfy claims fully as of december 31 2016 we had approximately 22 billion aggregate principal amount of secured debt outstanding and approximately 11 billion of availability under the senior secured credit facilities without giving effect to approximately 727 million of letters of credit outstanding 

united states federal and state statutes allow courts under specific circumstances to void the senior notes   and the guarantees subordinate claims in respect of the senior notes and the guarantees and require holders of the senior notes to return payments received from us or the guarantors 

our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that are obligors under the senior secured credit facilities guarantee the obligations under our senior notes in addition certain subsidiaries of the issuer of the euro notes guarantee the obligations under the euro notes the issuance of our senior notes and the issuance of the guarantees by the guarantors may be subject to review under state and federal laws if a bankruptcy liquidation or reorganization case or a lawsuit including in circumstances in which bankruptcy is not involved were commenced at some future date by or on behalf of our unpaid creditors or the unpaid creditors of a guarantor under the federal bankruptcy laws of the united states and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws a court may avoid or otherwise decline to enforce the notes or a guarantor’s guarantee or may subordinate the notes or such guarantee to our or the applicable guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness while the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction a court might do so if it found that when indebtedness under the notes was issued or when the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee or in some jurisdictions when payments became due under the notes or such guarantee the issuer or the applicable guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and 

 a court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or such guarantee if we or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the 

notes thus if the guarantees were legally challenged any guarantee could be subject to the claim that since the guarantee was incurred for our benefit and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration if a court were to void the issuance of the notes or any guarantee a holder of the notes would no longer have any claim against us or the applicable guarantor in the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred a holder of the notes may not receive any repayment on the notes further the avoidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt which could result in acceleration of that debt the measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred generally however an issuer or a guarantor as applicable would be considered insolvent if 

 a court might also void the notes or a guarantee without regard to the above factors if the court found that the notes were incurred or issued or the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee with actual intent to hinder delay or defraud its creditors we cannot give any assurance as to what standard a court would apply in determining whether we or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard or regardless of the standard that a court uses that it would not determine that we or a guarantor were indeed insolvent on that date that any payments to the holders of the notes including under the guarantees did not constitute preferences fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to our or any guarantor’s other debt in addition any payment by us or a guarantor pursuant to the notes or its guarantee could be avoided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors and accordingly the court might direct holders of the notes to repay any amounts already received from us or such guarantor among other things under us bankruptcy law any payment by us pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time we or such guarantor were found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a oneyear period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside party and such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such party would have received in a distribution under the bankruptcy code in a hypothetical chapter 7 case although each guarantee contains a “savings clause” intended to limit the subsidiary guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its subsidiary guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer this provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect any subsidiary guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law in that regard in official committee of unsecured creditors of   tousa inc v citicorp north america inc   the united states bankruptcy court in the southern district of florida held that a savings clause similar to the savings clause included in our indentures was unenforceable as a result the subsidiary guarantees were found to be fraudulent conveyances the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit subsequently affirmed the liability findings of the bankruptcy court without ruling directly on the enforceability of savings clauses generally if the decision of the bankruptcy court in tousa  were followed by other courts the risk that the guarantees would be deemed fraudulent conveyances would be significantly increased 

to the extent a court avoids the notes or any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or holds the notes or any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason the holders of the notes would cease to have any direct claim against us or the applicable guarantor if a court were to take this action our or the applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy our or the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities if any and might not be applied to the payment of the notes sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources including the remaining guarantors if any in addition the euro notes and the guarantees may be subject to avoidance under the laws of other foreign jurisdictions including italy and the czech republic to the extent that we or any of the guarantors as applicable were to be the subject of an insolvency or related proceeding in such jurisdictions 

not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our senior secured credit facilities or our senior notes and the assets of our nonguarantor subsidiaries may not be available to make payments on such obligations 

not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the senior secured credit facilities our us notes or our euro notes in the event that any nonguarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent liquidates reorganizes dissolves or otherwise winds up holders of its indebtedness and its trade creditors generally will be entitled to payment on their claims from the assets of that subsidiary before any of those assets are made available to the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities or the holders of the senior notes consequently claims in respect of the senior secured credit facilities and the senior notes are structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors of such instruments including trade payables and any claims of third party holders of preferred equity interests if any in our nonguarantor subsidiaries for the year ended december 31 

2016 our subsidiaries that are not borrowers under or do not guarantee the senior secured credit facilities and our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the us notes represented approximately 38 and 27 of our total revenue and operating income respectively in addition these nonguarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 46 and 34 of our total assets and total liabilities respectively as of december 31 2016 excluding in each case intercompany amounts as of the same date our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior secured credit facilities or the us notes had approximately 9230 million of outstanding indebtedness which includes 2678 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities by foreign subsidiaries that are borrowers under the revolving credit facilities but that do not guarantee the us notes the group of subsidiaries that does not guarantee the euro notes is similar to the group that does not guarantee the us notes except that there are four additional subsidiaries that guarantee the euro notes 

we may not be able to repurchase the senior notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer 

upon a change of control as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes the holders of the notes will have the right to require us to offer to purchase all of the notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest such a change of control would also be an event of default under our senior secured credit facilities in order to obtain sufficient funds to pay amounts due under the senior secured credit facilities and the purchase price of the outstanding senior notes we expect that we would have to refinance our indebtedness we cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance our indebtedness on reasonable terms if at all our failure to offer to purchase all outstanding senior notes or to purchase all validly tendered senior notes would be an event of default under the indenture such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other debt our other debt also may contain restrictions on repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture 

the definition of change of control in the indentures governing the senior notes includes a phrase relating to the sale of “all or substantially all” of our assets there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law accordingly the ability of a holder of senior notes to require us to repurchase its notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain 

in addition in certain circumstances as specified in the indentures governing the senior notes we will be required to commence an asset sale offer as defined in the indenture pursuant to which we will be obligated to purchase certain senior notes at a price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest with the proceeds we receive from certain asset sales our other debt may contain restrictions that would limit or prohibit us from completing any such asset sale offer in particular our senior secured credit facilities contain provisions that require us upon the sale of certain assets to apply all of the proceeds from such asset sale to the prepayment of amounts due under the senior secured credit facilities the mandatory prepayment obligations under the senior secured credit facilities will be effectively senior to our obligations to make an asset sale offer with respect to the senior notes under the terms of the indentures our failure to purchase any such senior notes when required under the indenture would be an event of default under the indentures 

  key terms of the senior notes will be suspended if the notes achieve investment grade ratings and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing 

many of the covenants in the indentures governing the senior notes will be suspended if the notes are rated investment grade by standard  poor’s and moody’s provided at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing including those covenants that restrict among other things our ability to pay dividends incur liens and to enter into certain other transactions there can be no assurance that the senior notes will ever be rated investment grade however suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force although provisions under our other debt like the senior secured credit facilities may continue to restrict us from engaging in these transactions and the effects of any such transactions will be permitted to remain in place even if the senior notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade 

the liquidity and market value of the senior notes may change due to a variety of factors 

the liquidity of any trading market in the senior notes and the market price quoted for the senior notes may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for these types of securities changes in interest rates changes in our ratings and changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industries generally 

we rely on an accounts receivable securitization program for a portion of our liquidity 

we have an arrangement whereby we sell an interest in a portion of our accounts receivable to a special purpose vehicle and receive funding through the commercial paper market this arrangement expires in november 2019 in the event that the market for commercial paper were to close or otherwise become constrained our cost of credit relative to this program could rise or credit could be unavailable altogether 

our credit ratings may not reflect all risks associated with an investment in our senior notes 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our results of operations actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy the rating agencies can upgrade or downgrade our current rating or place us on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely increase our cost of financing limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities including our senior notes

sources of revenue 

we report our revenue in two categories i parts and services and ii other our parts revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products and related services including i aftermarket other new and refurbished products and ii recycled remanufactured and related products and services our service revenue is generated primarily from the sale of extended warranties fees for admission to our self service yards and processing fees related to the secure disposal of vehicles for the year ended   december 31 2016  parts and services revenue represented approximately 95  of our consolidated revenue 

the majority of our parts and services revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle replacement products to collision and mechanical repair shops in north america our vehicle replacement products include sheet metal crash parts such as doors hoods and fenders bumper covers head and tail lamps automotive glass products such as windshields mirrors and grills wheels and large mechanical items such as engines and transmissions in europe our products include a wide variety of small mechanical products such as filters belts and hoses spark plugs alternators and water pumps batteries suspension and brake parts clutches and oil and lubricants the demand for these products is influenced by several factors including the number of vehicles in operation the number of miles being driven the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents the age profile of vehicles in accidents seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions and the availability and pricing of new oem parts with respect to collision related products automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process accordingly we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our vehicle replacement products while they are not our direct customers we do provide insurance carriers services in an effort to promote the increased usage of alternative replacement products in the repair process such services include the review of vehicle repair order estimates direct quotation services to insurance company adjusters and an aftermarket parts quality and service assurance program we neither charge a fee to the insurance carriers for these services nor adjust our pricing of products for our customers when we perform these services for insurance carriers there is no standard price for many of our vehicle replacement products but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as new oem product prices product availability quality demand the age and mileage of the vehicle from which the part was obtained in the case of recycled products competitor pricing and our product cost 

our revenue from aftermarket other new and refurbished products also includes revenue generated from the sale of specialty aftermarket vehicle equipment and accessories these products are primarily sold to a large customer base of specialty 

vehicle retailers and equipment installers including mostly independent singlesite operators specialty vehicle aftermarket products are typically installed on vehicles within the first year of ownership to enhance functionality performance or aesthetics as a result the demand for these products is influenced by new and used vehicle sales and the overall economic health of vehicle owners which may be affected by general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending the prices for our specialty vehicle products are based on manufacturers suggested retail prices with discounts applied based on prevailing market conditions customer volumes and promotions that we may offer from time to time 

for the year ended   december 31 2016  revenue from other sources represented approximately 5  of our consolidated sales these other sources include scrap sales bulk sales to mechanical manufacturers including cores and sales of aluminum ingots and sows from our furnace operations we derive scrap metal from several sources including vehicles that have been used in both our wholesale and self service recycling operations and from oems and other entities that contract with us for secure disposal of crush only vehicles other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold 

cost of goods sold 

our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts freight and overhead costs related to the purchasing warehousing and distribution of our inventory including labor facility and equipment costs and depreciation our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors our cost of goods sold for refurbished products includes the price we pay for cores freight and costs to refurbish the parts including direct and indirect labor facility and equipment costs depreciation and other overhead related to our refurbishing operations 

our cost of goods sold for recycled products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and where applicable auction towing and storage fees prices for salvage vehicles may be impacted by a variety of factors including the number of buyers competing to purchase the vehicles the demand and pricing trends for used vehicles the number of vehicles designated as “total losses” by insurance companies the production level of new vehicles which provides the source from which salvage vehicles ultimately come the age of vehicles at auction and the status of laws regulating bidders or exporters of salvage vehicles from time to time we may also adjust our buying strategy to target vehicles with different attributes for example age level of damage and revenue potential due to changes relating to these factors we have seen the prices we pay for salvage vehicles fluctuate over time our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles our labor and laborrelated costs related to acquisition and dismantling generally account for between 9 and 13 of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle the acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and as a result energy costs are not material 

our cost of goods sold for remanufactured products includes the price we pay for cores freight and costs to remanufacture the products including direct and indirect labor facility and equipment costs depreciation and other overhead related to our remanufacturing operations 

some of our salvage mechanical products are sold with a standard sixmonth warranty against defects additionally some of our remanufactured engines are sold with a standard threeyear warranty against defects we also provide a limited lifetime warranty for certain of our aftermarket products that is supported by certain of the suppliers of those products we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claims information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses 

other revenue is primarily generated from the hulks and unusable parts of the vehicles we acquire for our wholesale and self service recycled product operations and therefore the costs of these sales include the proportionate share of the price we pay for the salvage vehicles as well as the applicable auction storage and towing fees and internal costs to purchase and dismantle the vehicles our cost of goods sold for other revenue will fluctuate based on the prices paid for salvage vehicles which may be impacted by a variety of factors as discussed above 

expenses 

our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our aftermarket warehouses salvage yards and self service retail facilities these costs include personnel expenses such as wages incentive compensation and employee benefits for plant management and facility and warehouse personnel as well as rent for our facilities and related utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance the costs included in facility and warehouse expenses do not relate to inventory processing or conversion activities and as such are classified below the gross margin line on our consolidated statements of income 

our distribution expenses primarily include our costs to prepare and deliver our products to our customers included in our distribution expense category are personnel costs such as wages employee benefits and incentive compensation for drivers 

third party freight costs fuel and expenses related to our delivery and transfer trucks including vehicle leases repairs and maintenance and insurance 

our selling and marketing expenses primarily include salary commission and other incentive compensation expenses for sales personnel advertising promotion and marketing costs credit card fees telephone and other communication expenses and bad debt expense personnel costs generally account for between 75 and 80 of our selling and marketing expenses most of our sales personnel are paid on a commission basis the number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our customers’ needs and increase our sales volume our objective is to continually evaluate our sales force develop and implement training programs and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness 

our general and administrative expenses primarily include the costs of our corporate offices and field support center which provide management treasury accounting legal payroll business development human resources and information systems functions general and administrative expenses include wages benefits stockbased compensation and other incentive compensation for corporate regional and administrative personnel information systems support and maintenance expenses and accounting legal and other professional fees 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related repairs our specialty vehicle operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the first half of the year when vehicle owners tend to install this equipment we expect our aftermarket glass operations to generate greater revenue and earnings in the second and third quarters when the demand for glass replacements increases after the winter weather 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition inventory valuation business combinations and goodwill impairment we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue actual results may differ from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize and report revenue from the sale of vehicle products when they are shipped to or picked up by the customers and title has transferred subject to an allowance for estimated returns discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information in instances where a product is returned by a customer the product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment our customers may earn discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment we analyze historical returns and allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates we use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold if actual returns and allowances are higher than our historical experience there would be an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence 

we recognize revenue from the sale of scrap metal other metals and cores when title has transferred which typically occurs upon delivery to the customer 

inventory accounting 

salvage and remanufactured inventory  our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle including auction towing and storage fees as well as expenditures for buying and dismantling vehicles inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facilitys inventory at expected selling prices the assessment of which incorporates the sales probability based on a parts days in stock and historical demand the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facilitys historical profitability for salvage vehicles remanufactured inventory cost is based upon the price paid for cores and also includes expenses incurred for freight direct manufacturing costs and overhead related to our remanufacturing operations 

for all inventory carrying value is recorded at the lower of cost or market and is reduced to reflect current anticipated demand if actual demand differs from our estimates additional reductions to inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made 

business combinations 

we record our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values we utilize management estimates and in some instances independent thirdparty valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and contingent consideration granted such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions including projections of future events and operating performance 

goodwill impairment 

we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually when testing goodwill for impairment we are required to evaluate events and circumstances that may affect the performance of the reporting unit and the extent to which the events and circumstances may impact the future cash flows of the reporting unit to determine whether the fair value of the assets exceed the carrying value if these assumptions or estimates change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill 

we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist during 2016  we did not identify any events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts therefore we did not perform any impairment tests other than our annual test in the fourth quarter of 2016  as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test we were organized into five operating segments wholesale  north america europe specialty glass and self service our glass operating segment was composed of two reporting units the aftermarket business and the glass manufacturing business however goodwill was recorded only in the aftermarket reporting unit the other four operating segments were single reporting units for purposes of goodwill testing in 2016  

our goodwill would be considered impaired if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value the fair value estimates are established using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach we believe that using two methods to determine fair value limits the chances of an unrepresentative valuation as of december 31 2016  we had a total of 31 billion  in goodwill subject to future impairment tests we determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2016  on all five reporting units we noted that the proximity of the pgw acquisition to the goodwill testing date resulted in a fair value estimate for the glass aftermarket reporting unit which exceeded the carrying value by less than 10 this result aligns with our expectations as there has not been a significant change in the value of the business since the acquisition date while we continue to execute our integration plans no other reporting unit had a fair value estimate which exceeded the carrying value by less than 25 if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results

the change in parts and services revenue of 213  represents increases in segment revenue of 99  in north america 464  in europe and 135  in specialty the decrease in other revenue of 82  primarily consisted of a 534 million organic decline partially offset by 150 million of acquisition related growth refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to revenue change during 2016 compared to the prior year 

cost of goods sold  our cost of goods sold increased to 610  of revenue in 2016 from 606  of revenue in 2015 the increase in cost of goods sold reflects a negative effect of 06 from our rhiag acquisition which has lower gross margins than our prior year consolidated gross margin in addition our cost of goods sold increased 02 as a result of mix as we generated a greater proportion of our revenue in our specialty operations which has lower gross margins than our prior year consolidated gross margin these negative impacts were partially offset by lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue of 05 primarily related to our self service and wholesale operations in our north america segment refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue by segment for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year

year ended december 31 2015 compared to year ended december 31 2014 

revenue  the following table summarizes the changes in revenue by category amounts in thousands 



the change in parts and services revenue of 103  represents increases of 68 in north america 80 in europe and 306 in specialty the decline in other revenue of 267  primarily reflects the decline in the price of scrap steel and other metals refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to revenue changes during 2015 compared to the prior year 

cost of goods sold  our cost of goods sold decreased to 606  of revenue for the year ended december 31 2015 from 607  of revenue in the prior year the decrease is related to i a decline of 03 in costs of goods sold in our european operations as a result of a 02 decrease in our uk operations due to lower product costs and 01 due to internalizing gross margin from our may 2014 acquisitions of seven netherlands distributors and ii improved net pricing to customers in our north american operations as our purchase costs were flat on average the increase in revenue from favorable pricing resulted in a decrease of 02 in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue these decreases were offset by i an increase of 02 in our specialty operations due to higher inventory costs and unfavorable net customer pricing and ii a negative mix effect of 03 primarily resulting from growth of our specialty segment from our october 2014 acquisition of a supplier of parts for recreational vehicles as this business yields lower gross margins than our north american and european segments refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the change in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue by segment for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the prior year 

facility and warehouse expenses  as a percentage of revenue facility and warehouse expenses for the year ended december 31 2015 decreased to 77  from 78  in the prior year compared to the prior year we experienced a negative impact on operating leverage due to a decrease in other revenue primarily as a result of declining prices of scrap steel and other metals excluding the impact of the decline in scrap and other metal prices of 01 facility and warehouse expenses would have improved by 02 primarily reflecting a positive mix effect as a greater proportion of revenue was generated from our specialty segment compared to our north american operations specialty stores a greater portion of inventory at their regional distribution centers the costs of which are capitalized into inventory and expensed through cost of goods sold in our north american wholesale operations most of the inventory sold by our local operations is stored on site rather than in distribution centers and the related facility and warehouse expenses of the local operations are recorded in this line item 

distribution expenses  as a percentage of revenue distribution expenses for the year ended december 31 2015 decreased to 84  from 86  in the prior year distribution expenses decreased by 04 compared to the prior year due to fuel cost savings driven by lower average prices the decline in other revenue caused a 02 loss in operating leverage due to the revenue mix shift scrap and other metals revenue has lower distribution costs than parts sales

results of operations—segment reporting 

we have five operating segments wholesale – north america europe specialty glass and self service our wholesale – north america glass and self service operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment north america because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services customers and methods of distribution therefore we present three reportable segments north america europe and specialty 

subsequent to the sale of our glass manufacturing business we are combining our continuing glass aftermarket products operating segment into our wholesale – north america operating segment which we expect to complete in 2017 

we have presented the growth of our revenue and profitability in our operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis the constant currency presentation which is a nongaap measure excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth and profitability consistent with how we evaluate our performance as this statistic removes the translation impact of exchange rate fluctuations which are outside of our control and do not reflect our operational performance constant currency revenue and segment ebitda results are calculated by translating prior year revenue and segment ebitda in local currency using the current years currency conversion rate this nongaap financial measure has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap our use of this term may vary from the use of similarlytitled measures by other issuers due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation in addition not all companies that report revenue or profitability on a constant currency basis calculate such measures in the same manner as we do and accordingly our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarlynamed measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies

third party revenue  the following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our north america segment in thousands 





organic revenue growth in parts and services was also negatively affected by milder winter weather conditions in north america in the first quarter of 2016 which we believe impacted volume for the rest of the year 

                  segment ebitda  segment ebitda increased 489 million or 89 in 2016 compared to the prior year while other revenue decreased from the prior year sequential increases in scrap steel prices in our salvage and self service operations benefited gross margins and had a favorable impact of 77 million on north america segment ebitda and approximately a 002 positive effect on diluted earnings per share this favorable impact resulted from the increase in scrap steel prices between the date we purchased the car which influences the price we pay for the car and the date we scrapped the car which influences the price we receive for scrapping the vehicle

3  includes our revolving credit facilities our receivables securitization facility and letters of credit 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through both internal development and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our credit facilities we utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures with the excess amounts going towards funding acquisitions or paying down outstanding debt as we have pursued acquisitions as part of our growth strategy our cash flows from operations have not always been sufficient to cover our investing activities to fund our acquisitions we have accessed various forms of debt financing including revolving credit facilities senior notes and a receivables securitization facility 

as of december 31 2016  we had debt outstanding and additional available sources of financing as follows 

 from time to time we may undertake financing transactions to increase our available liquidity such as our january 2016 amendment to our senior secured credit facilities the issuance of €500 million of euro notes in april 2016 and the november 2016 amendment to our receivables securitization facility the rhiag acquisition was the catalyst for the april issuance of €500 million of euro notes given that rhiag is a long term asset we considered alternative financing options and decided to fund a portion of this acquisition through the issuance of long term notes additionally the interest rates on rhiags acquired debt ranged between 645 and 725 with the issuance of the €500 million of senior notes at a rate of 3875 we were able to replace rhiags borrowings with long term financing at favorable rates this refinancing also provides financial flexibility to execute our longterm growth strategy by freeing up availability under our revolver if we see an attractive acquisition opportunity we have the ability to use our revolver to move quickly and have certainty of funding 

 as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 102 billion available under our credit facilities combined with approximately 2274 million of cash and equivalents at december 31 2016  we had approximately 125 billion in available liquidity a decrease of 1785 million from our available liquidity as of december 31 2015  we expect to use the proceeds from the sale of pgws glass manufacturing business to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facilities which would increase our available liquidity by approximately 310 million when the transaction closes 

we believe that our current liquidity and cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements although such sources may not be sufficient for future acquisitions depending on their size while we believe that we have adequate capacity from time to time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements there can be no assurance that additional funding or refinancing of our credit facilities if needed will be available on terms attractive to us or at all furthermore any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants or higher interest costs our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at variable rates which are tied to libor or cdor depending on the currency and the duration of the borrowing plus an applicable margin rate which is subject to change quarterly based on our reported leverage ratio we hold interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates on a portion of our credit agreement borrowings with the effect of fixing the interest rates on the respective notional amounts in addition in 2016 we entered into cross currency swaps that contain an interest rate swap component and a foreign currency forward contract component that when combined with related intercompany financing arrangements effectively convert variable rate us dollardenominated borrowings into fixed rate eurodenominated borrowings these derivative transactions are described in note 10 derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k after giving effect to these contracts the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2016  was 20  including our senior notes and the borrowings on our receivables securitization program our overall weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 28  at december 31 2016  

cash interest payments were 860 million  for the year ended   december 31 2016  including interest payments totaling 285 million related to our senior notes in september 2016 we made our first semiannual interest payment on our euro notes totaling €90 million 101 million the remaining semiannual interest payments on our euro notes will be made in october and april each year cash interest payments in 2016 also included 80 million of interest paid as part of the settlement of rhiags acquired debt and 49 million to settle the acquired rhiag interest rate swap in the first quarter of 2016 

we had outstanding credit agreement borrowings of 21 billion  and 09 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015 respectively of these amounts 372 million and 225 million were classified as current maturities at december 31 2016  and 2015 respectively 

the scheduled maturities of longterm obligations outstanding at december 31 2016  are as follows in thousands 



our credit agreement contains customary covenants that provide limitations and conditions on our ability to enter into certain transactions the credit agreement also contains financial and affirmative covenants including limitations on our net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our credit agreement as of december 31 2016  

as of december 31 2016  the company had cash and equivalents of 2274 million  of which 1754 million was held by foreign subsidiaries we consider the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no provision for us income taxes has been provided thereon should these earnings be repatriated in the future in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to both us income taxes subject to adjustment for foreign tax credits and potential withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries we believe that we have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our financial obligations in the us without resorting to repatriation of foreign earnings

the remaining increase in cash provided by operating activities was attributable to our continuing operations during 2016 our income from continuing operations increased by 329 million compared to the prior year due to both acquisition related growth and organic growth in addition noncash depreciation and amortization expense increased by 701 million compared to the prior year primarily as a result of our rhiag and pgw acquisitions cash paid for taxes for our continuing 

operations increased by 370 million during 2016 compared to the prior year as a result of growth in the business primarily related to our rhiag acquisition 

cash outflows for our primary working capital accounts receivables inventory and payables totaled 1151 million during 2016  compared to 727 million during 2015  cash flows related to our primary working capital accounts can be volatile as the purchases payments and collections can be timed differently from period to period and can be influenced by factors outside of our control however we expect that the net change in these working capital items will generally be a cash outflow as we grow our business each year cash outflows related to receivables were 802 million higher in 2016 than the prior year the increase in accounts receivable is primarily related to our uk operations as a result of increased sales the remaining increase primarily related to our specialty operations which experienced larger growth in receivables balances during 2016 than the prior year period from organic and acquisition revenue growth compared to the prior year cash outflows related to inventory declined 166 million primarily a result of our north america and specialty operations this was partially offset by inventory growth in our uk operations as a result of incremental inventory purchases to stock new branches and the tamworth england national distribution center accounts payable represented a 170 million cash inflow in 2016 compared to a 42 million cash outflow in the prior year the increase is primarily related to a rise in the payables balance in our uk operations partially offset by a decline in the payables balance in our north america and rhiag operations due to the timing of payments 

net cash used in investing activities  totaled 17 billion  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 3300 million  in 2015  we invested 13 billion  of cash net of cash acquired in business acquisitions during 2016  which included 6014 million  for our rhiag acquisition and 6617 million  for our pgw acquisition compared to 1605 million  for business acquisitions in 2015 property and equipment purchases were 2071 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 1705 million  in the prior year purchases of property and equipment increased over the prior period primarily as a result of 242 million of purchases in our discontinued operations and a 196 million increase in our north america segment in 2016 we paid 1857 million  for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries primarily related to our investment in mekonomen payments for investments in consolidated subsidiaries were 97 million  in 2015 in 2016 we entered into foreign currency contracts to fund the purchase price of the rhiag acquisition which generated 183 million of gains we had no such contracts in the prior year period during 2016  cash provided by other investing activities net was 138 million  primarily from the proceeds on the sale of our interest in our australian joint venture compared to 107 million  in 2015 primarily as a result of proceeds from disposals of fixed assets 

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 12 billion  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to net cash used in financing activities of 2385 million  in 2015  during 2016  net borrowings under our credit facilities were 13 billion compared to net repayments of 1865 million in 2015  the increase in borrowings during 2016 is primarily the result of borrowings under our multicurrency revolving credit facility in order to fund the acquisitions of rhiag and pgw and investment in mekonomen and repay 5433 million  of rhiag acquired debt and debt related liabilities the increase in borrowings during 2016 also reflects our 2016 amendments of our credit facilities which generated 3385 million in additional term loan borrowings a portion of which was used to repay outstanding revolver borrowings in april 2016 we issued the euro notes generating proceeds of 5635 million the proceeds from the euro notes were used to repay a portion of the borrowings on the revolving credit facility in connection with our january and december 2016 amendments of our credit facilities our april 2016 issuance of the euro notes and our november 2016 amendment to our receivables securitization facility we paid 166 million of debt issuance costs during the 2016 debt issuance costs incurred in the prior year were minimal 

we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of distribution centers processing and sales facilities and warehouses through further integration of our facilities and through selected business acquisitions our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in 

 foreign exchange 

foreign currency fluctuations may impact the financial results we report for the portions of our business that operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar our operations outside of the us represented 391 and 328 of our revenue during 2016 and 2015 respectively an increase or decrease in the strength of the us dollar against these currencies by 10 would result in a 4 change in our consolidated revenue and a 3 change in our operating income for the year ended december 31 2016 see our results of operations discussion in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our year over year results 

additionally we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket products from foreign countries primarily in europe and asia to the extent that our inventory purchases are not denominated in the functional currency of the purchasing location we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in several of our operations we purchase inventory from manufacturers in taiwan in us dollars which exposes us to fluctuations in the relationship between the local functional currency and the us dollar as well as fluctuations between the us dollar and the taiwan dollar we hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations related to a portion of inventory purchases in our europe operations but the notional amount and fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2016 were immaterial we do not currently attempt to hedge foreign currency exposure related to our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in our north america operations and we may not be able to pass on any price increases to our customers 

other than with respect to a portion of our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases we do not hold derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency risk our net investment in foreign operations is partially hedged by the foreign currency denominated borrowings we use to fund foreign acquisitions however our ability to use foreign currency denominated borrowings to finance our foreign operations may be limited based on local statutory tax laws we have elected not to hedge the foreign currency risk related to the interest payments on foreign borrowings as we generate cash flows in the local currencies that can be used to fund debt payments as of december 31 2016 we had outstanding borrowings of €5000 million under our euro notes and £1187 million cad 1304 million sek 1160 million and €110 million under our revolving credit facilities 

interest rates 

our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facilities where interest rates are tied to the prime rate libor or cdor therefore we implemented a policy to manage our exposure to variable interest rates on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt instruments through the use of interest rate swap contracts these contracts convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt matching the currency effective dates and maturity dates to specific debt instruments net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swap contracts are included as adjustments to interest expense all of our interest rate swap contracts have been executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy wells fargo bank na bank of america na citizens na fifth third bank hsbc bank usa na and banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria sa 

as of december 31 2016 we held ten interest rate swap contracts representing a total of 590 million of us dollardenominated notional amount debt our interest rate swap contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and modify the variable rate nature of that portion of our variable rate debt these swaps have maturity dates ranging from january 2021 through june 2021 as of december 31 2016 the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was an asset of 164 million the values of such contracts are subject to changes in interest rates 

in addition to these interest rate swaps in 2016 we entered into three cross currency swap agreements for a total notional amount of 4224 million €400 million with maturity dates in january 2021 these cross currency swaps contain an interest rate swap component and a foreign currency forward contract component that combined with related intercompany financing arrangements effectively convert variable rate us dollardenominated borrowings into fixed rate eurodenominated borrowings the swaps are intended to eliminate uncertainty in cash flows in us dollars and euros in connection with intercompany financing arrangements the cross currency swaps were also executed with banks we believe are creditworthy wells fargo bank na bank of america na and the bank of tokyomitsubishi ufj ltd as of december 31 2016 the fair value of the interest rate swap components of the cross currency swaps was an asset of 15 million and the fair value 

of the currency forward components was a liability of 31 million the values of these contracts are subject to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in total we had 48 of our variable rate debt under our credit facilities at fixed rates at december 31 2016 compared to 29 at december 31 2015 see note 9 longterm obligations  and note 10 derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

at december 31 2016 we had 12 billion of variable rate debt that was not hedged using sensitivity analysis a 100 basis point movement in interest rates would change interest expense by 118 million over the next twelve months 

commodity prices 

we are exposed to market risk related to price fluctuations in scrap metal and other metals market prices of these metals affect the amount that we pay for our inventory as well as the revenue that we generate from sales of these metals as both our revenue and costs are affected by the price fluctuations we have a natural hedge against the changes however there is typically a lag between the effect on our revenue from metal price fluctuations and inventory cost changes and there is no guarantee that the vehicle costs will decrease at the same rate as the metal prices therefore we can experience positive or negative gross margin effects in periods of rising or falling metals prices particularly when such prices move rapidly additionally if market prices were to change at a greater rate than our vehicle acquisition costs we could experience a positive or negative effect on our operating margin scrap metal prices have increased 44 since the fourth quarter of 2015

 item 1 business 

overview 

lkq corporation lkq or the company is a global distributor of vehicle products including replacement parts components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles as well as specialty vehicle products and accessories 

buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers oems new products produced by companies other than the oems which are sometimes referred to as aftermarket products recycled products obtained from salvage vehicles used products that have been refurbished and used products that have been remanufactured we distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops including aftermarket collision and mechanical products recycled collision and mechanical products refurbished collision products such as wheels bumper covers and lights and remanufactured engines collectively we refer to these products as alternative parts because they are not new oem products 

we are the nation’s largest provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and a leading provider of alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products with our sales processing and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the us and canada we are also a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement and maintenance products in the united kingdom and the benelux region belgium netherlands  luxembourg of continental europe in addition to our wholesale operations we operate self service retail facilities across the us that sell recycled automotive products from endoflifevehicles with our 2014 acquisition of keystone automotive holdings inc “keystone specialty” we are also a leading distributor of specialty vehicle products and accessories reaching most major markets in the us and canada 

we are organized into four operating segments wholesale  north america europe specialty and self service we aggregate our wholesale  north america and self service operating segments into one reportable segment north america resulting in three reportable segments north america europe and specialty see note 13 segment and geographic information to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for financial information by reportable segment and by geographic region 

history 

lkq was initially formed in 1998 through the combination of a number of wholesale recycled products businesses located in florida michigan ohio and wisconsin we subsequently expanded through internal development and over 220 acquisitions of aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured product suppliers and manufacturers self service retail businesses and specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories suppliers our most significant acquisitions include 

  further information regarding our acquisitions is included in note 8 business combinations to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

strategy 

we are focused on creating economic value for our stockholders by enhancing our position as a leading source for alternative collision and mechanical repair products and by expanding into other product lines and businesses that may benefit from our operating strengths we believe a supply network with a broad inventory of quality alternative collision and 

mechanical repair products specialty vehicle aftermarket products high fulfillment rates and superior customer service provides us with a competitive advantage 

other than oems the competition in the markets that we serve is extremely fragmented and the supply of products tends to be localized often leading to low fulfillment rates particularly with recycled products in north america the distribution channels for aftermarket and refurbished products have historically been distinct and separate from those for recycled and remanufactured products despite serving the same customer segment we provide value to our customers by bringing these two channels together to provide a broader product offering and more efficient distribution process 

to execute our strategy in north america we have expanded our network of parts warehouses and dismantling plants in major metropolitan areas and employ a distribution system that allows for order fulfillment from regional warehouses located across the us and canada by increasing local inventory levels and expanding our network to provide timely access to a greater range of parts we have increased fulfillment rates beyond the levels that we believe most of our competitors realize particularly for recycled products 

in our european operations we will continue to develop our existing branch networks in the uk and benelux markets and add locations where needed in the uk we have undertaken a major project to expand our distribution capabilities in tamworth this project is expected to be completed in 2018 between now and completion we will incur some duplicate operating and other startup costs which may be material as a result of having multiple warehouses during the build out phase in the benelux markets we will continue the integration of the distributor acquisitions we have completed in that market and look for further expansion opportunities we continue to look for opportunities to lever our growing presence in europe through reduced cost of goods purchased and a lower total cost structure over time we anticipate further integration of our european operations as we optimize purchasing cataloging logistics and backoffice functions assuming we are successful in our acquisition of rhiag we expect to follow similar strategies in its respective markets 

sources of high quality reliable alternatives to oem products are important to insurance companies and to our direct customers as they seek to control repair costs lower parts costs and quicker completion of orders save money and reduce repair times we believe that we provide customers and indirectly insurance companies with a value proposition that includes high quality products at a lower cost than new oem products extensive product availability due to our expansive distribution network responsive service and quick delivery the breadth of our alternative parts offerings allows us to serve as a onestop solution for our customers looking for the most cost effective way to provide quality repairs in order to execute this strategy and build on our progress thus far we will continue to seek to expand into new markets and to improve penetration both organically and through acquisitions 

similarly in our specialty operations the supplier base for the specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and accessories market is highly fragmented typically consisting of suppliers that are small to mediumsized independent businesses that focus on a narrow product or market niche while our specialty operations had an extensive distribution network already in place we integrated the distribution network for our north american and specialty operations to create synergies and efficiencies with our existing infrastructure we believe this provides added value to our customers through a broader product offering and more efficient distribution process 

extensive inplace network 

we have invested significant capital to develop a network of alternative parts facilities across our operating segments we believe our extensive network gives us a distinct ability to benefit the major automobile insurance companies which are generally operated on a national or regional level additionally the difficulty and time required to obtain proper zoning as well as dismantling and other environmental permits necessary to operate newlysited recycled parts facilities would make establishing a new network of recycled parts locations a challenge for a competitor there are also difficulties associated with recruiting and hiring an experienced management team that has strong industry knowledge 

we are attempting to utilize a similar strategy in europe with our acquisitions of ecp sator and certain of sators distributors these companies have a national presence in their respective countries and we are working to integrate the operations to take advantage of shared procurement warehousing and product offerings 

strong business relationships 

we have developed business relationships with key constituents including automobile insurance companies suppliers and other industry participants in north america the united kingdom and the netherlands insurance companies as payers for most collision repairs help drive demand and take active roles in the selection of alternative replacement products for vehicle repairs in order to minimize the repair portion of the claims costs and reduce repair time the use of our products lowers the cost of repairs decreases the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and provides a replacement product that is of high quality and comparable performance to the part replaced all of which are favorable to insurance companies 

because of their importance to the process we have formed relationships with certain insurance companies in north america for which we are designated a preferred products supplier 

within our north american segment we provide quality assurance programs that offer additional product support to automobile insurance companies these product support programs identify specific subsets of aftermarket products by vendor and product type that can be used in the repair of vehicles that these companies insure the programs typically offer aftermarket products that have been produced by manufacturers certified by a third party testing lab we may provide additional validation of the quality of the products beyond our standard warranties and identification details that make the products traceable back to a manufacturers specific production run 

broad product offering 

the breadth and depth of our inventory across all of our operating segments reinforces lkqs ability to provide a onestop solution for our customers alternative vehicle replacement maintenance and specialty vehicle product needs customers place a high value on the availability of a broad range of vehicle replacement products historically in our north american operations we have been able to provide the collision and mechanical repair industry with premium products at costs typically 20 to 50 below new oem replacement products the availability of alternative products means that vehicles can be repaired with lower parts costs and in some instances reduced labor costs in fact many insurance companies in north america will not authorize the use of higher cost new oem replacement products if alternative products are available because the use of alternative products provides insurers a method to manage and reduce total repair costs some insurance companies designate us as a preferred supplier for their affiliated repair shops because of our ability to provide these products with our distribution network and extensive range of products we believe we are the only supplier that is able to support the insurance industry in this manner we leverage this same distribution network to provide a broad offering of specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories used to customize or enhance the performance handling or appearance of new or used vehicles additionally we believe we are wellpositioned in europe to continue developing our distribution network of a broad offering of vehicle replacement products to support mechanical repair shops in that market 

high fulfillment rates 

we manage local inventory levels to improve delivery time and maximize customer service improving local order fulfillment rates reduces transfer costs and delivery times and improves customer satisfaction our ability to move inventory throughout our distribution networks increases the availability of our products and also helps us to fill a higher percentage of our customers requests 

we deploy inventory management systems at our facilities that are similar to those used by other leading distribution companies for example we make extensive use of bar code technology and wireless data transmission to track parts from the time a vehicle or product arrives at a facility to its placement on a truck for delivery to the customer with this realtime information we are able to actively monitor inventory levels throughout our distribution channels 

technology driven business processes 

we focus on technology development as a way to support our competitive advantage we believe that we can more cost effectively leverage our data to make better business decisions than our smaller competitors we continue to develop our technology to better manage and analyze our inventory assist our salespeople with uptodate pricing and availability of our products and further enhance our inventory procurement process 

we employ proprietary methodologies and information systems to help us identify high demand wholesale aftermarket and recycled products our aftermarket inventory systems track products sold and sales lost due to a lack of inventory and make purchase recommendations based on this information the inventory systems also recommend purchases and transfers based on the extent and location of demand as well as other replenishment factors when we procure aftermarket products or refurbish collision replacement products such as wheels bumper covers and lights we focus on products that are in the most demand at all levels of the automotive parts value chain including the professional repair market the jobber market and the general insured repair market because lead times may take 40 days or more on imported products sales volume and instock inventory are important factors in the procurement process we use historical sales records of vehicles by model and year to estimate the demand for our products we also analyze new vehicle designs that are expected to come to market to assure that we are working with suppliers to project future supply and demand trends combining this information with proprietary data that aggregate customer requests for products we are able to source aftermarket products and salvage vehicles at prices that we believe will allow us to sell products profitably 

in europe we use a number of systems to manage our business these systems assist with our purchasing inventory management order fulfillment logistics and other business functions at each location our systems allow customers to review our inventory and make purchases and in many cases assist our customers with locating the appropriate part for repairs 

in our specialty operations we believe a focus on technology allows us to develop our business processes and enhance the customer experience our inventory forecasting systems help us ensure that the correct product is stocked in the right place to meet customer demand our warehousing and logistics systems help us deliver products to customers across the us and canada our online catalogs offer industry leading product information across all segments of automotive and recreational vehicle rv aftermarket parts and accessories and allow customers to search compare and order products based upon the specifications of a vehicle furthermore enhancements to our phone systems allow us to improve our customer support capability and the overall customer experience 

north america segment 

wholesale automotive products 

our wholesale automobile product operations in north america are organized by geographic regions serving the us and canada that sell all five product types aftermarket recycled remanufactured refurbished and oem parts to professional collision and mechanical automobile repair businesses our combined distribution channels for our alternative parts offerings leverage our facility and warehouse costs and improve local product availability by locating multiple product operations together our aftermarket product operations may include a combination of sales warehousing and distribution functions and in many cases will be colocated with our refurbishing operations our wholesale recycling operations typically have processing sales distribution and administrative operations on site indoor and outdoor storage areas and include a large warehouse with multiple bays to dismantle vehicles our engine remanufacturing operations are conducted primarily at our facilities in mexico as well as the us with sales warehousing and distribution operations in the us as of december 31 2015 our north american wholesale operations conducted business from 348 facilities 

wholesale aftermarket products 

our 2015 sales included more than 110000 skus of aftermarket automotive products excluding refurbished products for the most common models of domestic and foreign automobiles and light trucks primarily for the repair of vehicles three to twelve years old our principal aftermarket product types consist of those most frequently damaged in collisions including bumper covers automotive body panels and lights we also distribute paint and other materials used in repairing damaged vehicles including sandpaper abrasives masking products and plastic filler the paint and other materials distributed by us are purchased from numerous suppliers in the us and canada 

we expanded our wholesale aftermarket operations through the acquisition of partschannel inc “parts channel” in july 2015 at the time of acquisition parts channel was one of the leading domestic distributors of aftermarket products including collision replacement products 

platinum plus is our exclusive product line offered in the keystone brand of aftermarket products the platinum plus products are held to high quality standards and tested by quality assurance teams or independent third parties we also developed a product line called value line for more value conscious often selfpay consumers our value line products offer quality products at reasonable prices providing additional choices for repairs or rebuilding of vehicles 

certain of our products are certified by independent organizations such as the certified automotive parts association capa and nsf international nsf capa and nsf are associations that evaluate the functional equivalence of aftermarket collision replacement products to oem collision replacement products members of capa and nsf include insurance companies product distributors including lkq collision repair shops and consumers capa and nsf develop engineering specifications for aftermarket collision replacement products based upon examinations of oem products certify the factories manufacturing processes and quality control procedures used by independent manufacturers and certify the materials fit and finish of specific aftermarket collision replacement products 

lkq is certified under the nsf international automotive parts distributor certification program which addresses the needs of collision repair shops and insurers by maintaining quality management systems to address part traceability service and quality this certification program complements the existing parts certification program with nsf under which a broad range of automotive replacement parts are certified by nsf many major insurance companies have adopted policies recommending or requiring the use of products certified by capa or nsf a number of capa and nsf certified products are also marketed under the platinum plus brand 

procurement of inventory 

the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from independent manufacturers and distributors located primarily in the us taiwan and china in 2015 approximately 29 of our aftermarket purchases were made from our top four vendors with our largest vendor providing approximately 11 of our annual inventory purchases we believe we are one of the largest customers of each of these suppliers outside of this group no other supplier provided more than 5 of our supply of aftermarket products in 2015 we purchased approximately 54 of our aftermarket products in 2015 directly from 

manufacturers in taiwan and other asian countries approximately 45 of our aftermarket products were purchased from vendors located in the us and canada however we believe the majority of these products were manufactured in taiwan mexico or other foreign countries we have business arrangements with manufacturers to produce certain of our products these agreements automatically renew for additional 12 month periods unless written notice is given while we compete with other distributors for production capacity we believe that our sources of supply and our relationships with our suppliers are satisfactory 

we usually receive orders from domestic suppliers within ten days from the date ordered foreign orders typically are shipped in sea containers directly to certain of our aftermarket locations and are received within 30 to 55 days from the date ordered we operate an aftermarket parts warehouse in taiwan that aggregates inventory from certain of our vendors for shipment to our north american locations as of december 31 2015 we operated 24 regional hubs and three distribution centers which act as sources for our warehouse locations that do not receive containers directly and serve as redistribution centers for our operations 

wholesale recycled products 

our recycled products include engines transmissions door assemblies sheet metal products such as trunk lids fenders and hoods lights and bumper assemblies some insurance companies mandate that the recycled products must be of the same model year or newer as the vehicle being repaired as a result the majority of the products we sell are from vehicles not more than ten years of age installing recycled products often means that collision shops not only save on product cost but because several products may come preassembled the shops are also able to reduce labor costs 

we strive to be environmentally responsible our recycled automotive products provide an alternative to the manufacture of new products which would require the expenditure of more resources and energy and would generate additional pollution in addition we save landfill space because the parts that we recycle would otherwise be discarded we also collect materials such as metals plastics fuel and motor oil from the salvage vehicles that we procure and use them in our operations or sell them to other users 

procurement of inventory 

we procure recycled products for our wholesale operations by acquiring severely damaged or totaled vehicles and then dismantling and inventorying the parts vehicles that have been declared total losses typically are sold at regional salvage auctions throughout the us and canada salvage auctions charge fees both to the suppliers of vehicles which are primarily insurance companies and to the purchasers additionally we typically pay third parties to tow the vehicles from the auction to our facilities 

the availability and pricing of the salvage vehicles we procure for our wholesale recycled product operations may be impacted by a variety of factors including the production level of new vehicles and the portion of damaged vehicles declared total losses over the past several years the frequency with which vehicles are declared total losses has increased as a result¸ we believe of the rise in repair costs relative to vehicle replacement cost and salvage vehicle prices in 2000 approximately 9 of accident claims resulted in a total loss by 2014 this percentage increased to almost 14 with more than 70 of these total losses being declared for vehicles aged seven years or older additionally sales of new vehicles have increased since 2010 and are projected to continue to increase over the next 3 years which should result in a greater volume of salvage vehicles at auction 

in 2015 we acquired 287000 salvage vehicles for our wholesale recycled product operations primarily from salvage auctions prior to the scheduled auction date our salvage buyers may preview the auctions online to investigate the vehicles to be sold and determine our interest in buying them they obtain key information such as the model and mileage and perform visual damage assessments to determine which parts on the targeted vehicles are recyclable with the data from this preview we deploy a bidding system that performs a valuation calculation for each vehicle in order to recommend a maximum bid price the calculation incorporates demand for a vehicles recyclable parts current inventory levels average selling prices auction costs projected margins and instances of outofstock using this disciplined supply and demand procurement approach we place bids on the targeted vehicles 

vehicle processing 

vehicle processing for our wholesale recycled operations involves dismantling a salvage vehicle into recycled products that are ready for sale when a salvage vehicle arrives at our facility an inventory specialist identifies catalogs and schedules the vehicle for dismantling prior to dismantling we remove from each vehicle its battery fluids refrigerants and parts containing hazardous substances or precious metals such as catalytic converters the extracted fluids are stored in bulk and subsequently sold to recyclers in the case of gasoline the fuel retrieved is primarily used to power our delivery vehicles a small portion of the recycled motor oil we collect is used at certain of our plants that have highefficiency oil burning furnaces the balance is sold to motor oil recyclers 

when ready for dismantling each vehicle has an inventory report that indicates to the dismantler which parts should be removed and placed in a warehouse for future sales to customers which parts should be collected in bulk for our refurbishing and remanufacturing operations or for sale to parts remanufacturers and which parts have value but should remain on the vehicle until sold we utilize bar coding systems and wireless transmission to keep track of inventory from the time a product is removed and inventoried to the time it is sold and put on a truck for delivery 

refurbished and remanufactured products 

as of december 31 2015 we operated 25 refurbishing facilities and 4 engine remanufacturing facilities we refurbish products such as wheels lights plastic bumpers and chrome bumpers 

when identifying the products that we refurbish or remanufacture we focus on products that have high demand the majority of our refurbished and remanufactured products are processed from cores obtained from salvage vehicles purchased by our recycled operations parts received in trade from customers purchasing replacement products from us and cores collected by our route delivery drivers from vehicles under repair by our customers these products are accumulated from our wholesale operations at our core sorting facilities and are then either sent to our refurbishing or remanufacturing facilities or sold in bulk to other mechanical remanufacturers 

heavyduty truck products 

as of december 31 2015 we operated a total of 25 heavyduty truck facilities in the us and canada our inventory is composed of used heavyduty trucks usually at least five years old which are purchased at salvage and truck auctions or directly from insurance companies or large fleet operators during 2015 we purchased approximately 7000 vehicles depending on the condition of the vehicles they may be dismantled for parts or resold as running vehicles if certain mechanical parts are damaged such as transmissions we may remanufacture them and offer them to our customers the vehicles that are acquired for resale are typically special purpose or vocational use trucks such as those used for garbage pickup or cement delivery if requested by the sellers of the vehicles we provide assurance that the vehicles will be sold to foreign buyers and exported to countries for use outside of the us or to domestic buyers after the vehicles have been reconditioned and modified for use other than their original purpose 

scrap and other materials 

our wholesale recycled product operations generate scrap metal and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that have been dismantled for recycled products and crush only end of life vehicles acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site in other cases we will hire mobile crushing equipment to crush the vehicles before they are transported to shredders and scrap metal processors damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products including wheels we also extract and sell the precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts such as catalytic converters 

customers 

we sell our products to wholesale customers that include collision and mechanical repair shops and new and used car dealerships as well as to retail customers customers of our heavyduty truck products may also include owneroperators local cartage companies or exporters most of our refurbished and remanufactured products are sold through our wholesale distribution channels the balance is sold to retail automotive stores wholesale distributors and via internet sales we also generate a portion of our revenue from scrap sales to metal recyclers no single customer accounted for 2 or more of our revenue in 2015 

repair shops and others 

we sell the majority of our wholesale products to collision and mechanical repair shops industry reports estimate there were approximately 41000 collision repair shops including those owned by new car dealerships in the us in 2014 the same reports estimate there were approximately 79000 general including mechanical repair garages excluding new car dealership service departments in the us in 2014 the majority of these customers tend to be individuallyowned small businesses although the number of independent and dealeroperated collision repair facilities has declined over the last decade as regional or national multiple location operators have increased their geographic presence through acquisitions we also sell our products to car rental companies and fleet management groups 

insurance companies 

automobile insurance companies affect the demand for our collision products while insurance companies do not pay for our products directly they ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount as a result insurance companies often influence the types of products used in a repair 

our presence in most major markets in the us and canada gives us a distinctive ability to benefit the major automobile insurance companies insurance companies generally operate at a national or regional level the use of our products provides a direct benefit to these companies by lowering the cost of repairs decreasing the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and providing a replacement product that is of high quality and comparable performance to the part replaced 

we assist insurance companies by providing high quality aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured products to collision repair shops especially to repair shops that are part of an insurance companys direct repair program drp network a repair shop participating in a drp is referred potential work from the insurance company in exchange for providing assurances to the insurance company of quality timeliness and cost industry reports indicate that over half the claims paid for by top insurance companies in 2012 were paid through a drp compared to 42 in 2009 to meet the needs of the drps professional repairers have been required to become fluent in claims handling we offer our repair shop customers access to our proprietary system keyless which provides a link between their estimating systems and our inventory to identify the availability of alternative products for use in their repair this data also helps insurance companies monitor the body shops compliance with their drp product guidelines that might for instance stipulate the use of the lowest cost products that meet quality specifications in addition in some markets insurance companies are able to dispose of low value total loss vehicles directly to us so they can save the transaction fees associated with selling these vehicles through salvage auctions 

sales and marketing 

in the case of repairs paid for as a result of insurance claims which industry publications estimate are approximately 85 of all repairs insurance companies give collision repair shops information as to what type of replacement products are eligible for reimbursement typically insurance carriers have established a hierarchy or decision tree prioritizing the types of products to be used for repairs as an example a protocol may require recycled products if available if recycled products are not available then refurbished products and if recycled or refurbished products are not available aftermarket products if none of these alternative product types is available the shop may then use new oem replacement products once the estimated repair cost is determined the body shop will begin its search for required products the sourcing of products typically begins with a call to one of our recycled operations or one of our competitors our recycled sales personnel are encouraged to capture the sale as a onestop shop and if recycled products are out of stock to fill orders from our refurbished or aftermarket product inventory to support these efforts we have provided our sales staff with access to both recycled and aftermarket sales systems and we have developed sales incentive programs that encourage cross selling throughout our wholesale operations 

as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 2300 fulltime sales staff in our north american wholesale operating segment the full time sales personnel are located at sales desks at our facilities or at one of the regional call centers we operate we deploy a call routing system that redirects overflow calls to alternative call centers typically located within the same region we also operate two other call centers one to support national accounts and the other to support insurance adjusters needs and questions our sales personnel are encouraged to initiate outbound calls in addition to the inbound calls they handle our sales staff can use customer estimates from our keyless estimating system to generate sales leads for both aftermarket and recycled products 

we are continually reviewing and revising the pricing of wholesale products our pricing specialists consider factors such as recent demand levels inventory quantity on hand and turnover rates new oem product prices and local competitive pricing with the goal of optimizing revenue we set list prices and then sell items at a discount to list with the discount typically based on each customers purchasing volume we may adjust prices during the year in response to material price changes of new oem replacement products 

we believe our commitment to stock inventory in local warehouses supplemented by the inventory sharing system within our regional trading zones improves our ability to meet our customers requirements more frequently than our competitors and gives us a competitive advantage 

distribution 

we have a distribution network of 348 wholesale plants and warehouses across the us and canada as of december 31 2015 of which 66 function as cross dock facilities our network of facilities allows us to develop and maintain our relationships with local repair shops while providing a level of service that is made possible by our nationwide presence our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries as required by our customers using drivers who routinely deliver to the same customers our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network 

we have developed an internal distribution network to allow our sales representatives to sell our products within regional trading zones thus improving our ability to fulfill customer requests and accelerating inventory turnover each weekday we operate approximately 310 transfer runs between our cross dock facilities and our plants and warehouses within 

our regional trading zones to redistribute our alternative products for delivery on the next day in addition we have over 2900 local delivery routes serving our customers each weekday 

each sale results in the generation of a work order at the location housing the specific product a dispatcher is then responsible for ensuring fulfillment accuracy printing the final invoice and including the product on the appropriate truck route for delivery to the customer in markets where we offer more than one alternative product type we are integrating the delivery of multiple product types on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs and improve customer service we operate a delivery fleet of mediumsized trucks and smaller trucks and vans over time we expect that our delivery vehicles will become more consistent as we reconfigure the fleet to include vehicles that can carry all five product types 

competition 

we consider all suppliers of vehicle collision and mechanical products to be competitors including aftermarket suppliers recycling businesses refurbishing operations parts remanufacturers oems and internetbased suppliers we believe the principal areas of differentiation in our industry include availability of inventory pricing product quality and service 

the aftermarket product distribution business is highly fragmented and our competitors other than oems are generally independently owned distributors with one to three distribution centers similarly we compete with domestic vehicle product recyclers most of which are singleunit operators in some markets smaller competitors have organized affiliations to share marketing and distribution resources including internet sites we compete with alternative parts distributors on the basis of our nationwide distribution system our product lines and inventory availability customer service our relationships with insurance companies and to a lesser extent price we do not consider retail chains that focus on the doityourself market to be our direct competitors since many of our wholesale product sales are paid for by insurance companies rather than the end user 

manufacturers of original equipment products sell the majority of automobile collision replacement products we believe however that the insurance and repair industries recognize advantages of using aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured products for collision repairs industry sources estimate that alternative collision parts usage in the us ranged between approximately 36 and 37 during 2015 we compete with oems primarily on the basis of price and to a lesser extent on service and product quality 

self service retail products 

our self service retail operations sell parts from older cars and lightduty trucks directly to consumers in addition to revenue from the sale of parts core and scrap we charge a nominal admission fee to access the property our self service facilities typically consist of a fenced or enclosed area of several acres with vehicles stored outdoors and a retail building through which customers are able to access the yard as of december 31 2015 we conducted our self service operations from 78 facilities in north america most of which operate under the name lkq pick your part 

inventory 

we acquire inventory for our self service retail product operations from a variety of sources including but not limited to towing companies auctions the general public municipality sales insurance carriers and charitable organizations we typically procure salvage vehicles that are more than seven model years old for our self service retail product operations these vehicles are generally older and of lower quality than the salvage vehicles we purchase for our wholesale recycled product operations using our new car buying system implemented in 2015 we have streamlined the car buying process and are better able to facilitate the quoting purchasing and processing of cars in 2015 we purchased approximately 471000 lower cost self service and crush only vehicles 

vehicles are delivered to our locations by the seller or we arrange for transportation once on our property minimal labor is required to process the vehicle other than removing the battery fluids refrigerants catalytic converters and hazardous materials vehicles are then placed in the yard for customers to remove parts the vehicle inventory is usually organized according to domestic and import cars further organized by make passenger vans and trucks in our self service business availability of a specific part will depend on which vehicles are currently at the site and to what extent parts may have been previously sold we usually keep a vehicle at our facility for 30 to 90 days depending on the capacity of the yard and size of the market before it is crushed and sold to scrap metal processors by maintaining a relatively short turnover period we ensure that our inventory is continually updated with different car options or removed from the yard when the saleable parts are depleted 

scrap and other materials 

our self service operations generate scrap metal alloys and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that we no longer make available to the public and crush only vehicles acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site 

customers 

the customers of our self service yards are frequently doityourself mechanics small independent repair shops servicing older vehicles auto rebuilders and resellers the scrap from the vehicle hulks when not processed by us is sold to metals recyclers with whom we may also compete when procuring salvage vehicles for our operations 

sales and marketing 

we list part prices for automobiles and lightduty trucks on regularly updated price sheets with prices varying by part type but not by make or model for instance four cylinder engines are priced the same regardless of vehicle make model age or condition while we do not consider retail automotive chains to be our direct competitors as their product offerings are focused on maintenance products and mechanical parts we may reference their prices on certain parts as a benchmark to ensure our prices remain competitive 

competition 

there are competitors operating self service businesses in all of the markets in which we operate in some markets there are numerous competitors often operating in close proximity to our operations we try to differentiate our business by the quality of the inventory and the size and cleanliness of the property 

europe segment 

wholesale automotive products 

our european wholesale operating segment was formed in the fourth quarter of 2011 with our acquisition of ecp a leading distributor of automotive aftermarket parts in the uk ecp has approximately 8800 employees with a large customer base of both commercial and retail accounts the majority of ecp’s revenue comes directly from the professional repair segment ecp’s national distribution centers support its regional hubs and branch network with daily replenishment of stock providing our customers with what we believe to be the highest instock rate in the uk as of december 31 2015 we operated 218 selling locations supported by 3 national distribution centers and 17 regional hubs many of which are colocated with selling locations which allows us to reach most major markets within the uk 

our european aftermarket collision parts program is managed by our ecp branch network through which we sell our platinum plus aftermarket products we believe the historically low alternative collision parts usage percentage in europe which is currently less than 10 provides an opportunity for us in this segment particularly as insurance companies look to lower their costs to further our commitment to expanding our european alternative collision parts program and becoming a leading onestop shop supplier to the collision repair industry in the uk we also offer automotive paint products and related accessories 

in may 2013 we acquired sator which allowed us to expand our presence in europe to continental europe headquartered in schiedam the netherlands sator is a market leading distributor of automotive aftermarket parts in western europe the acquisition of sator expanded lkqs european presence and provides a potential platform to capitalize on the large and fragmented mechanical replacement parts market in europe sator also complements our existing ecp operations in the uk given the significant overlap in suppliers and product mix which allows for potential cost savings from the leveraging of our combined purchasing power efforts to combine the purchasing function in europe are ongoing and are expected to be a continuous effort over the coming years we have modified sators distribution model to be consistent with our uk operations primarily through acquisitions since the second quarter of 2014 of 18 warehouse distributors 14 of which were customers of sator these acquisitions are integral to our plan to implement a twostep distribution model for sator under which we are selling directly to repair shops in order to improve our margins drive product sales and ultimately sell collision parts in the benelux region 

sator has over 2800 employees at 97 aftermarket warehouses that serve a diverse base of repair shop and warehouse distributor customers sator generates approximately 89 of its revenue from sales in the netherlands and belgium with the remainder in northern france and other european countries with their respective distribution networks it infrastructure and unique customer base we believe ecp and sator will serve as a platform to expand into complementary products to increase market penetration in this segment as well as to further develop a collision repair parts business throughout europe similar to our wholesale operations in north america 

in november 2014 we expanded our european segment to include wholesale recycling operations through our acquisition of a business with salvage and vehicle repair facilities in sweden and norway we acquired an additional salvage business in sweden in october 2015 bringing our scandinavian employee headcount and warehouse count to 178 and 7 respectively in addition to expanding our geographic presence in europe we believe these acquisitions provide us with the opportunity to leverage our experience in operating salvage facilities in a new market and leaves us well positioned to expand our aftermarket operations to include these countries 

inventory 

in 2015 ecp’s and sator’s sales included 137000 skus and 166000 skus respectively our inventory is primarily composed of mechanical aftermarket parts for the repair of vehicles 3 to 15 years old our top selling products include brake pads discs and sensors clutches electrical products such as spark plugs and batteries steering and suspension products filters and oil and automotive fluids in 2015 our top five suppliers represented 20 of our inventory purchases with our top supplier representing approximately 8 of our purchases no suppliers outside of our top five suppliers provided more than 2 of our purchases during 2015 

the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from vendors located primarily in the uk and continental europe in 2015 we purchased 90 of our products from companies in europe the remaining 10 of our 2015 purchases were sourced from vendors located primarily in china or taiwan some of which also supply collision parts for our wholesale  north american operations in 2015 52 38 and 10 of our total inventory purchases were made in euros pounds sterling and us dollars respectively 

in our scandinavia operations we purchase severely damaged or totaled vehicles from insurance companies which are transferred to our dismantling facilities or sold to other third party dismantlers in 2015 we acquired over 8150 salvage vehicles for our wholesale recycled product operations and resold 11700 salvage vehicles to other third party dismantlers 

customers 

in our uk operations we sell the majority of our products to over 37000 commercial customers primarily consisting of professional repairers including both independent mechanical repair shops and collision repair shops in addition to our sales to repair shops we generate a portion of our revenue through sales to retail customers from ecp’s ecommerce platform and from counter sales at the branch locations this retail component of ecp’s business has historically represented approximately 10 of its revenue 

historically our distribution network in the benelux region operated under a threestep distribution model where the immediate customers were warehouse distributors since the second quarter of 2014 we have acquired 18 aftermarket parts distributors in the netherlands these acquisitions have enabled us to transform the original distribution model to a twostep distribution model our customer base currently consists of a combination of warehouse distributors and local repair shops and the demand for our products is driven by the needs of the same types of professional repairers we service in our ecp operations as a result our customer base primarily consists of local repair shops we still sell to some warehouse distributors although the proportion of revenue from the distributors has declined over time as we internalize this function sator markets directly to the mechanical repair shops through fliers and other promotional materials and provides software to the repair shops which the shops need for their operations during 2015 no customer accounted for more than 3 of revenue for ecp or sator 

sales and marketing 

ecp’s customers will generally call a sales representative at the nearest branch to place an order using an electronic automotive exchange and our integrated it platform displaying inventory availability our sales representatives locate the appropriate replacement part for a customer we set list prices for our products and then apply a discount off of list primarily depending on each customers purchasing volume we utilize a businesstobusiness website with certain of our customers to enable them to place product orders online through a customized interface that includes detailed parts specifications customerspecific pricing local branch availability and account information we believe this customer interface will result in fewer parts returns by improving order accuracy and will also reduce the time required by parts specialists to advise customers whether placed via a phone order or online customer orders are filled from the local branch or routed to another location as necessary to fill the order 

sator’s sales and marketing platform is a proprietary stock management system that provides repair shops jobbers and end users with an efficient system for ordering from our product catalog directly online through this online system sator is able to actively monitor inventory levels at all stages in the aftermarket automotive parts value chain in its markets 

similar to our north american wholesale operations insurance companies significantly influence the purchasing decisions for collision products in europe as a result we are attempting to establish business relationships with insurance companies and implement insurerbased marketing models in the uk by emphasizing the cost savings that can be achieved through the use of alternative parts as we continue to grow our collision parts offerings in the uk we believe we will be wellpositioned to serve as a lowercost alternative for insured repairs throughout europe given the majority of uk carriers offer coverage in multiple european countries outside of the uk 

distribution 

our european operations employ a distribution model in which inventory is stored at regional distribution centers or hubs with fast moving product stored at branch locations or at local warehouse distributors for some of our sator operations for timely delivery to the repair shop customers product is moved through the distribution network on our vans or via common 

carrier in our ecp operations we also sometimes employ a third party motorcycle fleet to deliver parts from our branch locations to nearby repair shop customers as a result our ecp branches can deliver certain instock parts within one hour 

competition 

we view all suppliers of replacement repair products as our competitors including other alternative parts suppliers and oems and their dealer networks while we compete with all alternative parts suppliers there are few with national distribution networks like ecp and sator that can reach the majority of repair shop customers within the required delivery time within their respective markets we believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other alternative parts suppliers primarily through our distribution network efficient stock management systems and proprietary technology which allows us to deliver our products quickly as well as through our product lines and inventory availability pricing and service we compete with oems primarily on the basis of price service and availability 

specialty segment 

specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories 

our specialty operating segment was formed in january 2014 with our acquisition of keystone specialty keystone specialty is a leading distributor and marketer of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories in north america serving the following six product segments truck and offroad speed and performance rv towing wheels tires and performance handling and miscellaneous accessories our specialty segment has over 2200 employees we expanded our specialty operating segment through our october 2014 acquisition of a supplier of replacement parts supplies and accessories for rvs our august 2015 acquisition of the coast distribution system inc “coast” added to product offerings for the rv and outdoor recreation markets with these acquisitions we are a leading distributor and marketer of specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories reaching most major markets in the us and canada

customers 

specialty automotive and rv aftermarket accessories and equipment are purchased by our customers to improve the performance functionality and appearance of their vehicles overall the specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and accessories market contains a fragmented customer base comprised of specialty vehicle product installation outlets automotive parts chains or mailorder in 2015 we sold products to approximately 20000 customers our customers are principally small independent retailers and installers of specialty vehicle automotive equipment these businesses depend on us to provide a broad range of products rapid delivery marketing support and technical assistance in addition to traditional customers in recent years we have increased sales to several large automotive parts and online retailers during 2015 our top two customers accounted for approximately 6 of specialty segment revenue while no other customer accounted for more than 1 of revenue 

sales and marketing

competition 

industry participants have a variety of supply choices vendors can deliver products to market via warehouse distributors and mail order catalogs or directly to retailers andor consumers we view all suppliers of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories as our competitors while we compete with all specialty vehicle aftermarket parts suppliers there are few with national distribution networks like lkq’s that can reach the majority of customers within the optimum delivery time we believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other specialty vehicle aftermarket parts suppliers primarily through our broad product selection which encompasses both popular and hardtofind products our distribution network and efficient stock management systems as well as through our service we compete on the basis of product breadth and depth rapid and dependable delivery marketing initiatives support services and price 

intellectual property 

we own various trade names and trademarks as a result of past acquisitions in addition to acquired trade names and trademarks we also have technology based intellectual property that includes both internally developed websites and license agreements we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any single or group of related trademarks licenses or registrations nor would the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property license agreement materially affect our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 31100 employees we are a party to a collective bargaining agreement with a union that represents 45 employees at our totowa new jersey facility approximately 790 of our employees at our bumper refurbishing and engine remanufacturing operations in mexico and 160 of our employees at our recycled parts facility in quebec city canada are also represented by unions other than these locations none of our employees are members of a union or participate in other collective bargaining arrangements we consider our employee relations to be good 

facilities 

our corporate headquarters are located at 500 west madison street chicago illinois 60661 we operate a field support center in nashville tennessee that performs certain centralized functions for our north american operations including accounting procurement and information systems support our specialty operations maintain primary procurement accounting and finance functions in exeter pennsylvania certain backoffice support functions for our segments are performed in bangalore india our european operations maintain procurement accounting and finance functions in wembley outside of london england and in schiedam the netherlands in addition to these offices we have numerous operating facilities that handle wholesale and self service retail product operations we operate out of more than 790 locations in total most of which are leased many of our locations stock multiple product types or serve more than one function 

included in our total locations are 424 facilities in the us and 219 facilities in the uk including the 500000 square foot national distribution center in tamworth that houses inventory to supply the hubs and branches of our uk operations in 2015 we began working with a developer on a second national distribution center in tamworth the 750000 square foot facility will be fully operational by 2018 we also operate 97 facilities in continental europe 41 facilities in canada seven facilities in scandinavia four facilities in mexico and two facilities in central america additionally we operate an aftermarket parts warehouse in taiwan to aggregate inventory for shipment to our locations in north america 

information technology 

in our north american operations our aftermarket operations use a third party enterprise management system additional third party software packages have been implemented to leverage the centralized data and information that a single system provides such as a data warehouse to conduct enhanced analytics and reporting an integrated budgeting system an 

electronic data interchange tool and ecommerce tools to enhance our online businesstobusiness initiatives orderkeystonecom and keyless the systems used by our aftermarket operations are also used by all of our refurbishing operations 

our wholesale recycled product locations in north america operate an internallydeveloped proprietary enterprise management system called lkqx we believe that the use of a single system across all of our wholesale recycled product operations helps facilitate the sales process allows for continued implementation of standard operating procedures and yields improved training efficiency employee transferability access to our national inventory database management reporting and data storage the system also supports an electronic exchange process for identifying and locating parts at other select recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock our bidding specialists responsible for procuring vehicles for our wholesale salvage operations are equipped with a proprietary software application that compares the vehicles at the salvage auctions to our current inventory historical demand and recent average selling prices to arrive at an estimated maximum bid this bidding system reduces the likelihood of purchasing unneeded parts that might result in obsolete inventory 

to better serve our customers a consolidated approach has been taken for the electronic sale of wholesale products in our north american segment a full suite of ecommerce services is available to approved partners that helps us improve order accuracy reduce return rate and better fit our customer workflow using these services in coordination with our partners products can be searched priced and ordered without leaving the customers own operating systems 

 we operate a single enterprise system for all of our heavyduty truck operations that supports interregion sales to reduce the potential for lost sales due to outofstock parts we are also transitioning to a single it platform to support our remanufacturing operations we operate an internallydeveloped point of sale system in our self service retail operations which allows enhanced management reporting as well as improved system reliability through wwwlkqpickyourpartcom our self service customers can access key information including yard location vehicle inventory and pricing by part type 

our aftermarket operations in the uk use a single integrated it platform for our purchasing branch stock and finance activities which are further supported by a national distribution center system to manage inventory movement the it system allows customers to identify the correct part for repairs thereby improving customer satisfaction and reducing return rates our aftermarket operations in continental europe use several it systems which are linked to transfer data between systems to manage customer orders and inventory movement and for financial reporting purposes this it system can interface with our repair shop customers respective it systems which enables them to identify the part required for the repair 

our specialty operations utilize an internally developed inventory management and order entry system that interfaces with third party software systems for accounting transaction processing data analytics and reporting online sales of our specialty products take place through our ekeystonecom and viantpcom sites these sites provide customers i the ability to match products with the make and model of car thus allowing the customer to order the right part ii the product information eg pictures attributes available for review and iii the convenience of searching inventory availability and ordering the product on the site additionally the site can provide sales opportunities by suggesting other parts to purchase based on an inquiry submitted by the customer our delivery fleet utilizes a third party software provider to optimize delivery routes and to track the progress of delivery vehicles throughout their runs 

the hardware that supports the systems used in our operations is located in offsite data centers the centers are in secure environments with aroundtheclock monitoring redundant power backup and multiple diverse data and telecommunication routing we use separate third party provided software for our financial systems such as financial and budget reporting general ledger accounting accounts payable payroll and fixed assets we currently protect our local customer inventory and corporate consolidated data such as financial information email files and other user files with daily backups these backups are stored off site with a third party data protection vendor additionally we restrict access to customer employee and vendor data to those users that have permission granted to them as part of their job function we have made investments in various logging encryption event correlation and data loss prevention software to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and extraction of personally identifiable information of all types including that of vendors customers and employees customer credit card information is not stored within the company’s computing environment and the card information is encrypted when it is transmitted and processed for authorization 

we continually evaluate our systems with the goal of ensuring that all critical systems remain secure scalable and operational as our business grows 

regulation 

environmental compliance 

our operations and properties are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety in the us as well as other countries in which we operate these environmental laws govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water mercury and other hazardous materials 

we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters we have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements we cannot assure you however that we will at all times be in complete compliance with such requirements 

although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly environmental laws may change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

contamination resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release storage transportation or disposal of gasoline motor oil antifreeze transmission fluid chlorofluorocarbons cfcs from air conditioners other hazardous materials or metals such as aluminum cadmium chromium lead and mercury contamination from the refurbishment of chrome plated bumpers can occur from the release of the plating material contamination can migrate onsite or offsite which can increase the risk and the amount of any potential liability 

in addition many of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use that may have involved hazardous materials as a result some of our properties may be contaminated some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination even if these owners or operators did not know of and were not responsible for such contamination these environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of treats or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties or successors to such owners or operators for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 

when we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process we analyze the risks and when appropriate perform further environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination furthermore where appropriate we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters in addition at times we or sellers from whom we purchased a business have undertaken remediation projects we do not anticipate based on currently available information and current laws that we will incur liabilities in excess of reserves to address environmental matters however in the event we discover new information or if laws change we may incur significant liabilities which may exceed our reserves 

title laws 

in some states when a vehicle is deemed a total loss a salvage title is issued whether states issue salvage titles is important to the supply of inventory for the vehicle recycling industry because an increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles currently these titling issues are a matter of state law in 1992 the us congress commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle titling registration and salvage since then legislation has been introduced seeking to establish national uniform requirements in this area including a uniform definition of a salvage vehicle the vehicle recycling industry will generally favor a uniform definition since it will avoid inconsistencies across state lines and will generally favor a definition that expands the number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage however certain interest groups including repair shops and some insurance associations may oppose this type of legislation national legislation has not yet been enacted in this area and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in the future 

anticar theft act 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any 

covered major part the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on vehicle recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may discourage the use by such shops of recycled products there is no pending initiative to implement the parts registration from a law enforcement point of view however there is a risk that a heightened legislative concern over safety of parts might precipitate an effort to push for the implementation of such rules 

legislation affecting automotive repair parts 

most states have laws relating to the use of aftermarket products in motor vehicle collision repair work the provisions of these laws may include consumer disclosure vehicle owners consent regarding the use of aftermarket products in the repair process and the requirement to have aftermarket products certified by an independent testing organization some jurisdictions have laws that regulate the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags additional laws of this kind may be enacted in the future an increase in the number of states passing such legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on our business additionally congress could enact federal legislation restricting the use of aftermarket and recycled automotive products used in the course of collision repair 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related accidents which generate repairs we expect our specialty operations to generate greater revenue and earnings in the first half of the year when vehicle owners tend to install specialty products 




 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

our operating results and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the economic and political conditions in the us and elsewhere 

changes in economic and political conditions in the us and other countries in which we are located or do business could have a material effect on our company changes in such conditions have in some periods resulted in fewer miles driven fewer accident claims and a reduction of vehicle repairs all of which could negatively affect our business our sales are also impacted by changes to the economic health of vehicle owners the economic health of vehicle owners is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit taxation fuel prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside of our control if any of these conditions worsen our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities and interest rate swap transactions these unfavorable events affecting our business partners could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we face intense competition from local national international and internetbased vehicle products providers and this competition could negatively affect our business 

the vehicle replacement products industry is highly competitive and is served by numerous suppliers of oem recycled aftermarket refurbished and remanufactured products within each of these categories of suppliers there are local owneroperated companies larger regional suppliers national and international providers and internetbased suppliers providers of vehicle replacement products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of vehicle replacement products which may further increase competition some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise greater financial technical manufacturing distribution and other resources longer operating histories lower cost structures and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries or with consumers than we do in certain regions of the us local vehicle recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in the wholesale recycled products industry similarly in europe some local companies 

are part of cooperative efforts to compete in the aftermarket parts industry as a result of these factors our competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply provide their products at lower costs or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve 

we believe that a majority of collision parts by dollar amount are supplied by oems with the balance being supplied by distributors like us the oems are therefore in a position to exert pricing pressure in the marketplace we compete with the oems primarily on price and to a lesser extent on service and quality from time to time the oems have implemented programs seeking to increase their market share in the collision repair parts industry for example they have experimented with reducing prices on specific products to match the lower prices of alternative products and with other initiatives that may disrupt our sales if such price reductions were to become widespread it could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we rely upon our customers and insurance companies to promote the usage of alternative parts 

our success depends in part on the acceptance and promotion of alternative parts usage by automotive insurance companies there can be no assurance that current levels of alternative parts usage will be maintained or will increase in the future in addition in some places we operate alternative parts usage is relatively low we also rely on business relationships with insurance companies these insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide the business relationships include in some cases participation in aftermarket quality and service assurance programs that may result in a higher usage of our aftermarket products than would be the case without the programs our arrangements with these companies may be terminated by them at any time including in connection with their own business concerns relating to the offering availability standards or operations of the aftermarket quality and service assurance programs we rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in an illinois lawsuit involving state farm mutual automobile insurance company avery v state farm a jury decided in october 1999 that state farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using nonoem replacement products to repair damaged vehicles when use of such products did not restore the vehicle to its preloss condition the jury found that state farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of nonoem replacement products and the alleged inferiority of those products the jury assessed damages against state farm of 456 million and the judge assessed an additional 730 million of disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the illinois consumer fraud act in april 2001 the illinois appellate court upheld the verdict but reduced the damage award by 130 million because of duplicative damage awards on august 18 2005 the illinois supreme court reversed the awards made by the circuit court and found among other things that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any breach of contract by state farm the us supreme court declined to hear an appeal of this case as a result of this case some insurance companies reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket products our financial results could be adversely affected if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled products from us due to a fear of similar claims 

in addition to the extent that the collision repair industry continues to consolidate the buying power of collision repair shop customers may further increase putting additional pressure on our financial returns 

we may not be able to successfully acquire new businesses or integrate acquisitions which could cause our business to suffer 

we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms if we do not obtain antitrust or other regulatory approvals on applicable terms or for other reasons moreover we may not be able to identify a sufficient number of acquisition candidates at reasonable prices to maintain our growth objectives also over time we will likely seek to make acquisitions that are relatively larger as we grow larger acquisition candidates may attract additional competitive buyers which could increase our cost or could cause us to lose such acquisitions 

if we buy a company or a division of a company we may experience difficulty integrating that companys or divisions personnel and operations which could negatively affect our operating results in addition 

• the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 

• customers of the acquired company may decide not to purchase products from us 

• suppliers of the acquired company may decide not to sell products to us 

• we may experience business disruptions as a result of information technology systems conversions 

• we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning treasury management and financial reporting 

• we may be held liable for environmental tax or other risks and liabilities as a result of our acquisitions some of which we may not have discovered during our due diligence 

• we may intentionally assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire which could result in material adverse affects on our business 

• our existing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention 

• we may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated either in the amount or in the time frame that we expect and 

• we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition the issuance of which could involve the imposition of restrictive covenants or be dilutive to our existing stockholders 

claims by oems relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business 

oems and other manufacturers have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims the oems have brought such claims in federal court and with the us international trade commission 

to the extent oems and other manufacturers are seeking and obtaining more design patents than they have in the past and are successful in asserting infringement of these patents and defending their validity we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business we will likely incur significant expenses investigating and defending intellectual property infringement claims in addition aftermarket products certifying organizations may revoke the certification of parts that are the subject of the claims lack of certification may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of aftermarket products only if they have been certified by an independent certifying organization 

in december 2005 and may 2008 ford global technologies llc filed complaints with the international trade commission against us and others alleging that certain aftermarket products imported into the us infringed on ford design patents the parties settled these matters in april 2009 pursuant to a patent license arrangement that expires in march 2020 in january 2014 chrysler group llc filed a complaint against us in the us district court in the eastern district of michigan contending that certain aftermarket parts we sell infringe chrysler design patents relating to the dodge ram pickup truck the parties settled this matter in june 2014 pursuant to a patent license arrangement that expires in june 2019 in the event that these license arrangements or other similar license arrangements with oems are terminated or we are unable to agree upon renewal terms we may be subject to costs and uncertainties of litigation as well as restrictions on our ability to sell aftermarket parts that replicate parts covered by design patents 

if the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines or the number of cars being repaired declines our business could suffer 

our business depends on vehicle accidents and mechanical failures for both the demand for repairs using our products and the supply of recycled remanufactured and refurbished parts thus our business is impacted by factors which influence the number andor severity of accidents and mechanical failures including but not limited to the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven the ages of drivers the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions the congestion of traffic the use of cellular telephones and other electronic equipment by drivers the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers the effectiveness of accident avoidance systems in new vehicles the reliability of new oem parts and the condition of roadways for example an increase of the acceptance of the ridesharing business model would reduce the number of vehicles on the road additionally an increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the need for mechanical repairs and maintenance to decline as motorists seek alternative transportation options mild weather conditions particularly during winter months tend to result in a decrease in vehicle accidents moreover a number of states and municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones or other electronic devices while driving and such restrictions could lead to a decline in accidents 

systems designed to help drivers avoid accidents are becoming more prevalent and more technologically sophisticated to the extent oems install or are mandated by law to install accident avoidance systems in their vehicles the number and severity of accidents could decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the average number of new vehicles sold annually has fluctuated from yeartoyear periods of decreased sales could result in a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road and consequently fewer vehicles involved in accidents or in need of mechanical repair or maintenance substantial further declines in automotive sales in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition in addition if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of older vehicles on the road insurance companies may find it uneconomical to repair such vehicles or there could be less costly repairs if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of newer vehicles on the road the demand generally for mechanical repairs and maintenance would likely decline due to the newer longerlasting parts in the vehicle population and mechanical failures being covered by oem warranties for the first years of a vehicles life moreover alternative collision and mechanical parts are less likely to be used on newer vehicles 

fluctuations in the prices of metals and other commodities could adversely affect our financial results 

our recycling operations generate scrap metal and other metals that we sell after we dismantle a salvage vehicle for wholesale parts and after vehicles have been used in our self service retail business the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors and other remaining metals are sold to processors and brokers of metals in addition we receive crush only vehicles from other companies including oems which we dismantle and which generate scrap metal and other metals the prices of scrap and other metals have historically fluctuated sometimes significantly due to market factors in addition buyers may stop purchasing metals entirely due to excess supply to the extent that the prices of metals decrease materially or buyers stop purchasing metals our revenue from such sales will suffer and a writedown of our inventory value could be required the cost of our wholesale recycled and our self service retail inventory purchases will change as a result of fluctuating scrap metal and other metals prices in a period of falling metal prices there can be no assurance that our inventory purchasing cost will decrease the same amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal and other metals prices decline and there may be a delay between the scrap metal and other metals price reductions and any inventory cost reductions the prices of steel aluminum and plastics are components of the cost to manufacture products for our aftermarket business if the price of commodities rise and result in higher costs to us for products we sell we may not be able to pass these higher costs on to our customers 

we may not be able to sell our products due to existing or new laws and regulations prohibiting or restricting the sale of aftermarket recycled refurbished or remanufactured products 

some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled products in addition the federal trade commission ftc has issued guides which regulate the use of certain terms such as “rebuilt” or “remanufactured” in connection with the sale of automotive parts restrictions on the products we are able to sell and on the marketing of such products could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

most states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair work andor require enhanced disclosure or vehicle owner consent before using aftermarket products in such repair work additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future if additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business certain organizations test the quality and safety of vehicle replacement products if these organizations decide not to test a particular vehicle product or in the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product such events could adversely affect our business 

an adverse change in our relationships with our suppliers or auction companies or a disruption to our supply of inventory could increase our expenses and impede our ability to serve our customers 

our business is dependent on a relatively small number of suppliers of aftermarket products a large portion of which are sourced from taiwan we incur substantial freight costs to import parts from our suppliers many of which are located in asia if the cost of freight rose we might not be able to pass the cost increases on to our customers furthermore although alternative suppliers exist for substantially all aftermarket products distributed by us the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on us until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced providing products in addition we are subject to disruptions from work stoppages and other labor disputes at port facilities through which we import our inventory moreover our operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad including among other things natural disasters transportation costs and delays political instability currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs import and export controls and other nontariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas as well as the uncertainty regarding future relations between china japan and taiwan because a substantial volume of our sales involves products manufactured from sheet metal we can be adversely impacted if sheet metal becomes unavailable or is only available at higher prices which we may not be able to pass on to our customers additionally as manufacturers convert to raw materials other than steel it may be more difficult or expensive to source aftermarket parts made with such materials and it may be more difficult for repair shops to work with such materials in the repair process 

most of our salvage and a portion of our self service inventory is obtained from vehicles offered at salvage auctions operated by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the us we do not typically have contracts with the auction companies according to industry analysts a small number of companies control a large percentage of the salvage auction market in the us if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions began competing with us or significantly raised its fees our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers moreover we face competition in the purchase of vehicles from direct competitors rebuilders exporters and others to the extent that the number of bidders increases it may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold for wholesale recycled products some states regulate bidders to help ensure that salvage vehicles are purchased for legal purposes by qualified buyers auction companies have been actively seeking to reduce circumvent or eliminate these 

regulations which would further increase the number of bidders in addition there is a limited supply of salvage vehicles in the us as we grow and our demand for salvage vehicles increases the costs of these incremental vehicles could be higher 

we also acquire inventory directly from insurance companies oems and others to the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue these arrangements our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control future factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to those listed in the special note on forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k accordingly our results of operations may not be indicative of future performance these fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below our published financial guidance and the expectations of public markets which could cause our stock price or the value of our debt instruments to decline 

if we lose our key management personnel we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives if we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel which could harm our business 

we operate in foreign jurisdictions which exposes us to foreign exchange and other risks 

we have operations in belgium canada france mexico sweden the netherlands taiwan and the uk and we may expand our operations in these countries and into other countries our foreign operations expose us to additional risks associated with international business which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition including import and export requirements and compliance with anticorruption laws such as the uk bribery act 2010 and the foreign corrupt practices act we also incur costs in currencies other than our functional currencies in the countries in which we operate we are thus subject to foreign exchange exposure to the extent that we operate in different currencies as well as exposure to foreign tax and other foreign and domestic laws in addition mexico is currently experiencing a heightened level of criminal activity that could affect our ability to maintain our supply of certain aftermarket products 

if we determine that our goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired we may incur significant charges to our pretax income 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations in the future goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of acquisitions goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses increases in our cost of capital adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including modifications that restrict the activities of the acquired business as of december 31 2015 our total goodwill subject to future impairment testing was 23 billion for further discussion of our annual impairment test see goodwill impairment in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of item 7 in this annual report on form 10k 

we amortize other intangible assets over the assigned useful lives each of which is based upon the expected period to be benefited we review other intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in the event conditions change that affect our ability to realize the underlying cash flows associated with our intangible assets we may record an impairment charge as of december 31 2015 the value of our other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization was 215 million 

our business may be adversely affected by union activities and labor laws 

a small percentage of our employees are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining or similar agreements which are subject to periodic renegotiation from time to time there have been efforts to organize additional portions of our workforce and those efforts can be expected to continue in addition the us department of labor or applicable foreign government agencies could adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations that could make it significantly easier for unionization efforts to be successful also we may in the future be subject to strikes or work stoppages and other labor disruptions additional unionization efforts new collective bargaining agreements and work stoppages could materially increase our costs and reduce revenue and could limit our flexibility in terms of work schedules reductions in force and other operational matters 

we also are subject to federal and state laws and regulations such as the fair labor standards act that govern such matters as minimum wage overtime and other working conditions some of these laws are technical in nature and could be subject to interpretation by government agencies different than our interpretations efforts to comply with existing laws changes to such laws and newlyenacted laws may increase our labor costs if we were found not to be in compliance with such laws we could be subject to fines penalties and liabilities to our employees or government agencies 

we rely on information technology and communication systems in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business 

some of the information technology systems and communication systems we use for management of our facilities and our financial functions are leased from or operated by other companies while others are owned by us in the event that the providers of these systems terminate their relationships with us or if we suffer prolonged outages of these or our own systems for whatever reason we could suffer disruptions to our operations 

in the event that we decide to switch providers or to implement upgrades or replacements to our own systems we may also suffer disruptions to our business we may be unsuccessful in the development of our own systems and we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing our own systems also our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system which period could extend longer than we anticipated 

our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and employees we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information however if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to damage to our reputation additional costs lost sales or possible regulatory action the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly changing and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our operations the function of our computer systems andor the availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in the closure of our distribution centers “dc”s or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory through our system on a timely basis this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states or into the other countries in which we operate and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials 

under certain environmental laws we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at or migration to or from our or our predecessors past or present facilities and at independent waste disposal sites these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or was not responsible for the release of such hazardous substances 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we could be subject to product liability claims and involved in product recalls 

if customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage we could be subject to product liability claims by such customers the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we may become involved in the recall of a product that is determined to be defective the expenses of a recall and the damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have agreed to defend and indemnify in certain circumstances insurance companies and customers against claims and damages relating to product liability and product recalls the existence of claims or damages for which we must defend and indemnify these parties could also negatively impact our business results of operations or financial condition 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits 

our operating subsidiaries in our salvage selfservice and refurbishing operations must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations when we develop or acquire a new facility we must seek the approval of state and local units of government governmental agencies may resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling or refurbishing facility in their communities there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold 

new regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and otherwise adversely impact our business  

in august 2012 as mandated by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec adopted final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals originating from the democratic republic of congo drc or adjoining countries these new requirements impose significant burdens on us public companies compliance with the rules requires substantial due diligence in an effort to determine whether products contain the conflict minerals the results of such due diligence efforts must be disclosed on an annual basis in a filing with the sec 

our supply chain is complex and we may incur significant costs to determine the source of any such minerals used in our products we may also incur costs with respect to potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of our diligence activities further the implementation of these rules and their effect on customer supplier andor consumer behavior could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering products free of conflict minerals in some circumstances we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary products from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflictfree or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement accordingly these rules could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition 

if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks our business could be harmed 

we use a fleet of trucks to deliver the majority of the products we sell we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in the transportation infrastructure governmental regulation availability and price of fuel liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance and insurance premium increases in addition our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

regulations that may be issued under the anticar theft act could harm our business 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any covered major part the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on automotive parts recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may discourage the use of recycled products by such shops 

risks relating to our common stock and financial structure 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline additionally the market price for our common stock has been in the past and in the future may be 

adversely affected by allegations made or reports issued by short sellers analysts or others regarding our business model our management or our financial accounting 

following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

delaware law our charter documents and our loan documents may impede or discourage a takeover which could affect the price of our stock 

the antitakeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws our loan documents and delaware law could together or separately impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult our credit agreement provides that a change of control is an event of default our incorporation under delaware law and these provisions could also impede an acquisition takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the price of our common stock 

future sales of our common stock or other securities may depress our stock price 

we and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock or other equity debt or instruments which constitute an element of our debt and equity collectively securities in the future we may also issue shares of common stock under our equity incentive plan or in connection with future acquisitions we cannot predict the size of future issuances of securities or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock or other securities will have on the price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued in connection with an acquisition the issuance of additional debt securities or the perception that such sales or issuances could occur may cause the price of our common stock to fall 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to react to changes in our business 

as of december 31 2015 we had  16 billion  aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding including  480 million  under our senior secured credit facilities  600 million  aggregate principal amount of 475  senior notes due 2023 4106 million  under our term loan and  63 million  under our accounts receivable securitization program as of december 31 2015 we also had  13 billion  of undrawn availability after giving effect to approximately  66 million  of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facilities and  34 million  of undrawn availability under our accounts receivable securitization program 

on january 29 2016 we entered into an amendment to our senior secured credit facility to increase the capacity to 32 billion composed of approximately 750 million in term loans and 245 billion in a multicurrency revolving credit line the credit facility matures in january 2021 

our significant amount of debt and our debt service obligations could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations limit our ability to operate our business and impair our competitive position 

for example it could 

 in addition if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the ability to service such debt would increase 

although we are subject to our senior secured credit facilities for so long as they remain in effect the indenture that governs the senior notes does not restrict the future incurrence of unsecured indebtedness guarantees or other obligations the indenture contains certain limitations on our ability to incur liens on assets sell our assets make dividends and distributions and engage in sale and leaseback transactions however these limitations are subject to important exceptions in addition the indenture does not contain many other restrictions including certain restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities including without limitation restrictions on investments incurring indebtedness or prepaying subordinated indebtedness or engaging in transactions with our affiliates 

our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability among other things to 

• incur assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness including guarantees thereof 

• pay dividends or certain other distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness 

• incur liens on assets 

• make certain investments or other restricted payments 

• engage in transactions with affiliates 

• sell certain assets or merge or consolidate with or into other companies 

• guarantee indebtedness and 

• alter the business we conduct 

as a result of these covenants and restrictions we will be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit agreement a default if not waived could result in acceleration of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing credit facilities or it may be on terms that are not acceptable to us 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due any future refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations additionally the senior secured credit facilities and the indenture that governs our senior notes limit the use of the proceeds from certain dispositions of our assets as a result our senior secured credit facilities and our senior notes may prevent us from using the proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all of our debt service obligations 

in addition we are a holding company and repayment of our indebtedness is dependent upon cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are borrowers or guarantors of the indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries 

and under certain circumstances distributions from our subsidiaries may be subject to significant taxes that reduce the amount of such distributions available to us in the event that we do not receive sufficient distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our future capital needs may require that we seek to refinance our debt or obtain additional debt or equity financing events that could have a negative effect on our business 

we may need to raise additional funds in the future to among other things refinance existing debt fund our existing operations improve or expand our operations respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions from time to time we may raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic alliances or other arrangements funds may not be available or available on terms acceptable to us as a result of different factors including but not limited to turmoil in the credit markets that results in the tightening of credit conditions and current or future regulations applicable to the financial institutions from whom we seek financing if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and further limitations on our operations if we refinance or restructure our debt we may incur charges to write off the unamortized portion of deferred debt issuance costs from a previous financing or we may incur charges related to hedge ineffectiveness from our interest rate swap obligations in addition there are restrictions in the indenture that governs our senior notes on our ability to refinance the notes prior to 2018 if we fail to raise capital when needed our business may be negatively affected 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly and could affect the value of our senior notes 

certain borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and the borrowing under our accounts receivable securitization facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness would correspondingly decrease moreover changes in market interest rates could affect the trading value of our senior notes 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our senior notes 

credit ratings have an important effect on our cost of capital credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include among other items our results of operations business decisions that we make their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading we believe our current credit ratings enhance our ability to borrow funds at favorable rates a downgrade in our current credit rating from a rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facilities a downgrade could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our senior notes preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future or incur other indebtedness upon favorable terms 

  the right to receive payments on the senior notes is effectively junior to those lenders who have a security interest in our assets 

our obligations under the senior notes and our guarantors’ obligations under their guarantees of the senior notes are unsecured but our and each coborrower’s obligations under our senior secured credit facilities and each guarantor’s obligations under their respective guarantees of the senior secured credit facilities are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our domestic tangible and intangible assets including the stock of most of our whollyowned united states subsidiaries and the stock of certain of our nonunited states subsidiaries if we are declared bankrupt or insolvent or if we default under our senior secured credit facilities the lenders could declare all of the funds borrowed thereunder together with accrued interest immediately due and payable if we were unable to repay such indebtedness the lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets to the exclusion of holders of the senior notes even if an event of default exists under the indenture governing the notes furthermore if the lenders foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any subsidiary guarantor under the senior notes then that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the senior notes automatically and immediately upon such sale in any such event because the senior notes are not secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in subsidiary guarantors it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from which claims by holders of the senior notes could be satisfied or if any assets remained they might be insufficient to satisfy claims fully 

united states federal and state statutes allow courts under specific circumstances to void the senior notes   and the guarantees subordinate claims in respect of the senior notes and the guarantees and require holders of the senior notes to return payments received from us or the guarantors 

our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that are obligors under the senior secured credit facilities also guarantee the 

obligations under the senior notes our issuance of the senior notes and the issuance of the guarantees by the guarantors under the secured credit facilities and the senior notes may be subject to review under state and federal laws if a bankruptcy liquidation or reorganization case or a lawsuit including in circumstances in which bankruptcy is not involved were commenced at some future date by or on behalf of our unpaid creditors or the unpaid creditors of a guarantor under the federal bankruptcy laws and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws a court may avoid or otherwise decline to enforce the senior secured credit facilities the senior notes or a guarantor’s guarantee or may subordinate the senior secured credit facilities the senior notes or such guarantee to our or the applicable guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness while the relevant laws may vary from state to state a court might do so if it found that when indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities was incurred or the senior notes were issued or when the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee or in some states when payments became due under the senior secured credit facilities the senior notes or such guarantee the borrower the issuer or the applicable guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and 

 • was engaged in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital or 

• intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature 

a court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the senior secured credit facilities the senior notes or such guarantee if we or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the senior secured credit facilities or the issuance of the senior notes the measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred generally however a borrower an issuer or a guarantor as applicable would be considered insolvent if 

 a court might also void the senior secured credit facilities the senior notes or a guarantee without regard to the above factors if the court found that the senior secured credit facilities or the senior notes were incurred or issued or the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee with actual intent to hinder delay or defraud its creditors in addition any payment by us or a guarantor pursuant to the senior secured credit facilities the senior notes or its guarantee could be avoided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors and accordingly the court might direct the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities or the holders of the senior notes to repay any amounts already received from us or such guarantor although each guarantee contains a “savings clause” intended to limit the subsidiary guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its subsidiary guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer this provision may not be effective to protect any subsidiary guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law furthermore in official committee of unsecured creditors of tousa inc v citicorp north america inc the united states bankruptcy court in the southern district of florida held that a savings clause similar to the savings clause included in the documents relating to our senior secured credit facilities and senior notes was unenforceable as a result the subsidiary guarantees were found to be fraudulent conveyances the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit recently affirmed the liability findings of the bankruptcy court without ruling directly on the enforceability of savings clauses generally if the tousa decision were followed by other courts the risk that the guarantees would be deemed fraudulent conveyances would be significantly increased 

to the extent a court avoids the senior secured credit facilities or the senior notes or any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or holds the senior secured credit facilities or the senior notes or any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities or the holders of the senior notes as the case may be would cease to have any direct claim against us or the applicable guarantor if a court were to take this action our or the applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy our or the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities if any and might not be applied to the payment of the senior secured credit facilities or the senior notes as the case may be sufficient funds to repay the senior secured credit facilities and the senior notes may not be available from other sources including the remaining guarantors if any 

not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our senior secured credit facilities or our senior notes and the assets of our nonguarantor subsidiaries may not be available to make payments on such obligations 

not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the senior secured credit facilities or the senior notes in the event that any nonguarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent liquidates reorganizes dissolves or otherwise winds up holders of its indebtedness and its trade creditors generally will be entitled to payment on their claims from the assets of that subsidiary 

before any of those assets are made available to the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities or the holders of the senior notes consequently claims in respect of the senior secured credit facilities and the senior notes are structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of our nonguarantor subsidiaries including trade payables and any claims of third party holders of preferred equity interests if any in our nonguarantor subsidiaries for the year ended december 31 2015 our subsidiaries that are not borrowers under or do not guarantee the senior secured credit facilities and our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes represented approximately 33 and 26 of our total revenue and operating income respectively in addition these nonguarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 35 and 37 of our total assets and total liabilities respectively as of december 31 2015 excluding in each case intercompany amounts with respect to both the senior secured credit facilities and the senior notes of these amounts as of the same date our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes and our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior secured credit facilities had approximately 5435 million of outstanding indebtedness which includes 4805 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities by foreign subsidiaries that are borrowers under the revolving credit facilities but that do not guarantee the notes 

we may not be able to repurchase the senior notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer 

upon a change of control as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes the holders of the notes will have the right to require us to offer to purchase all of the notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest such a change of control would also be an event of default under our senior secured credit facilities in order to obtain sufficient funds to pay amounts due under the senior secured credit facilities and the purchase price of the outstanding senior notes we expect that we would have to refinance our indebtedness we cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance our indebtedness on reasonable terms if at all our failure to offer to purchase all outstanding senior notes or to purchase all validly tendered senior notes would be an event of default under the indenture such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other debt our other debt also may contain restrictions on repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture 

the definition of change of control in the indenture governing the senior notes includes a phrase relating to the sale of “all or substantially all” of our assets there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law accordingly the ability of a holder of senior notes to require us to repurchase its notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain 

in addition in certain circumstances as specified in the indenture governing the senior notes we will be required to commence an asset sale offer as defined in the indenture pursuant to which we will be obligated to purchase certain senior notes at a price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest with the proceeds we receive from certain asset sales our other debt may contain restrictions that would limit or prohibit us from completing any such asset sale offer in particular our senior secured credit facilities contain provisions that require us upon the sale of certain assets to apply all of the proceeds from such asset sale to the prepayment of amounts due under the senior secured credit facilities the mandatory prepayment obligations under the senior secured credit facilities will be effectively senior to our obligations to make an asset sale offer with respect to the senior notes under the terms of the indenture our failure to purchase any such senior notes when required under the indenture would be an event of default under the indenture 

  key terms of the senior notes will be suspended if the notes achieve investment grade ratings and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing 

many of the covenants in the indenture governing the senior notes will be suspended if the notes are rated investment grade by standard  poor’s and moody’s provided at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing including those covenants that restrict among other things our ability to pay dividends incur liens and to enter into certain other transactions there can be no assurance that the senior notes will ever be rated investment grade however suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force although provisions under our other debt like the senior secured credit facilities may continue to restrict us from engaging in these transactions and the effects of any such transactions will be permitted to remain in place even if the senior notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade 

the liquidity and market value of the senior notes may change due to a variety of factors 

the liquidity of any trading market in the senior notes and the market price quoted for the senior notes may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for these types of securities changes in interest rates changes in our ratings and changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industries generally 

we rely on an accounts receivable securitization program for a portion of our liquidity 

we have an arrangement whereby we sell an interest in a portion of our accounts receivable to a special purpose vehicle and receive funding through the commercial paper market this arrangement expires in october 2017 in the event that the market for commercial paper were to close or otherwise become constrained our cost of credit relative to this program could rise or credit could be unavailable altogether

acquisitions and investments 

since our inception in 1998 we have pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions we have pursued acquisitions that we believe will help drive profitability cash flow and stockholder value our principal focus for acquisitions is companies that are market leaders will expand our geographic presence and enhance our ability to provide a wide array of automotive products to our customers through our distribution network

sources of revenue 

we report our revenue in two categories i parts and services and ii other our parts and services revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products and related services including i aftermarket other new and refurbished products and ii recycled remanufactured and related products and services our service revenue is generated primarily from the sale of extended warranties fees for admission to our self service yards and processing fees related to the secure disposal of vehicles for the year ended   december 31 2015  parts and services revenue represented approximately 93  of our consolidated revenue 

the majority of our parts and services revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle replacement products to collision and mechanical repair shops in north america our vehicle replacement products include sheet metal crash parts such as doors hoods and fenders bumper covers mirrors and grills head and tail lamps wheels and large mechanical items such as engines and transmissions in europe our products include a wide variety of small mechanical products such as filters belts and hoses spark plugs alternators and water pumps batteries suspension and brake parts clutches and oil and lubricants the demand for these products is influenced by several factors including the number of vehicles in operation the number of miles being driven the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents the age profile of vehicles in accidents seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions and the availability and pricing of new oem parts with respect to collision related products automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process accordingly we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our vehicle replacement products while they are not our direct customers we do provide insurance carriers services in an effort to promote the increased usage of alternative replacement products in the repair process such services include the review of vehicle repair order estimates direct quotation services to insurance company adjusters and an aftermarket parts quality and service assurance program we neither charge a fee to the insurance carriers for these services nor adjust our pricing of products for our customers when we perform these services for insurance carriers there is no standard price for many of our vehicle replacement products but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as product availability quality demand new oem product prices the age and mileage of the vehicle from which the part was obtained competitor pricing and our product cost 

our revenue from aftermarket other new and refurbished products also includes revenue generated from the sale of specialty aftermarket vehicle equipment and accessories these products are primarily sold to a large customer base of specialty vehicle retailers and equipment installers including mostly independent singlesite operators specialty vehicle aftermarket products are typically installed on vehicles within the first year of ownership to enhance functionality performance or aesthetics as a result the demand for these products is influenced by new and used vehicle sales and the overall economic health of vehicle owners which may be affected by general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels 

and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending the prices for our specialty vehicle products are based on manufacturers suggested retail prices with discounts applied based on prevailing market conditions customer volumes and promotions that we may offer from time to time 

for the year ended   december 31 2015  revenue from other sources represented approximately 7  of our consolidated sales these other sources include scrap sales and sales of aluminum ingots and sows we derive scrap metal from several sources including vehicles that have been used in both our wholesale and self service recycling operations and from oems and other entities that contract with us for secure disposal of crush only vehicles other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold 

cost of goods sold 

our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts freight and overhead costs related to the purchasing warehousing and distribution of our inventory including labor facility and equipment costs and depreciation our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors our cost of goods sold for refurbished products includes the price we pay for cores freight and costs to refurbish the parts including direct and indirect labor facility and equipment costs depreciation and other overhead related to our refurbishing operations 

our cost of goods sold for recycled products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and where applicable auction towing and storage fees prices for salvage vehicles may be impacted by a variety of factors including the number of buyers competing to purchase the vehicles the demand and pricing trends for used vehicles the number of vehicles designated as “total losses” by insurance companies the production level of new vehicles which provides the source from which salvage vehicles ultimately come the age of vehicles at auction and the status of laws regulating bidders or exporters of salvage vehicles from time to time we may also adjust our buying strategy to target vehicles with different attributes for example age level of damage and revenue potential due to changes relating to these factors we have seen the prices we pay for salvage vehicles fluctuate over time our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles our labor and laborrelated costs related to acquisition and dismantling generally account for between 9 and 11 of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle the acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and as a result energy costs are not material our cost of goods sold for remanufactured products includes the price we pay for cores freight and costs to remanufacture the products including direct and indirect labor facility and equipment costs depreciation and other overhead related to our remanufacturing operations 

some of our salvage mechanical products are sold with a standard sixmonth warranty against defects additionally some of our remanufactured engines are sold with a standard threeyear warranty against defects we also provide a limited lifetime warranty for certain of our aftermarket products that is supported by certain of the suppliers of those products we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claims information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses 

other revenue is primarily generated from the hulks and unusable parts of the vehicles we acquire for our wholesale and self service recycled product operations and therefore the costs of these sales include the proportionate share of the price we pay for the salvage vehicles as well as the applicable auction storage and towing fees and internal costs to purchase and dismantle the vehicles our cost of goods sold for other revenue will fluctuate based on the prices paid for salvage vehicles which may be impacted by a variety of factors as discussed above 

expenses 

our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our aftermarket warehouses salvage yards and self service retail facilities these costs include personnel expenses such as wages incentive compensation and employee benefits for plant management and facility and warehouse personnel as well as rent for our facilities and related utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance the costs included in facility and warehouse expenses do not relate to inventory processing or conversion activities and as such are classified below the gross margin line on our consolidated statements of income 

our distribution expenses primarily include our costs to prepare and deliver our products to our customers included in our distribution expense category are personnel costs such as wages employee benefits and incentive compensation for drivers third party freight costs fuel and expenses related to our delivery and transfer trucks including vehicle leases repairs and maintenance and insurance 

our selling and marketing expenses primarily include salary commission and other incentive compensation expenses for sales personnel advertising promotion and marketing costs credit card fees telephone and other communication expenses and bad debt expense personnel costs generally account for between 75 and 80 of our selling and marketing expenses most of our sales personnel are paid on a commission basis the number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability 

to respond to our customers’ needs and increase our sales volume our objective is to continually evaluate our sales force develop and implement training programs and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness 

our general and administrative expenses primarily include the costs of our corporate offices and field support center which provide management treasury accounting legal payroll business development human resources and information systems functions general and administrative expenses include wages benefits stockbased compensation and other incentive compensation for corporate regional and administrative personnel information systems support and maintenance expenses and accounting legal and other professional fees 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related accidents which generate repairs we expect our specialty vehicle operations to generate greater revenue and earnings in the first half of the year when vehicle owners tend to install specialty products 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition inventory valuation business combinations and goodwill impairment we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue actual results may differ from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize and report revenue from the sale of vehicle products when they are shipped to or picked up by the customers and title has transferred subject to an allowance for estimated returns discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information in instances where a product is returned by a customer the product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment our customers may earn discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment we analyze historical returns and allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates we use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold if actual returns and allowances are higher than our historical experience there would be an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence 

we recognize revenue from the sale of scrap metal other metals and cores when title has transferred which typically occurs upon delivery to the customer 

inventory accounting 

salvage and remanufactured inventory  our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle including auction towing and storage fees as well as expenditures for buying and dismantling vehicles inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facilitys inventory at expected selling prices the assessment of which incorporates the sales probability based on a parts days in stock and historical demand the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facilitys historical profitability for salvage vehicles remanufactured inventory cost is based upon the price paid for cores and also includes expenses incurred for freight direct manufacturing costs and overhead related to our remanufacturing operations 

for all inventory carrying value is recorded at the lower of cost or market and is reduced to reflect current anticipated demand if actual demand differs from our estimates additional reductions to inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made 

business combinations 

we record our acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values we utilize management estimates and in some instances independent thirdparty valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and contingent consideration granted such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions including projections of future events and operating performance 

goodwill impairment 

  

we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually when testing goodwill for impairment we are required to evaluate events and circumstances that may affect the performance of the reporting unit and the extent to which the events and circumstances may impact the future cash flows of the reporting unit to determine whether the fair value of the assets exceed the carrying value if these assumptions or estimates change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill 

we are organized into four  operating segments wholesalenorth america europe specialty and self service we have also concluded that these four  operating segments are reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing in 2015  we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist 

our goodwill would be considered impaired if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value the fair value estimates are established using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach we believe that using two methods to determine fair value limits the chances of an unrepresentative valuation 

during the quarter ended september 30 2015 we noted that our north american operating margins continued to be negatively affected by the decline in scrap steel and other metals prices which began in the fourth quarter of 2014 our self service reporting unit has been most impacted by the change in scrap steel prices as the sale of crushed car bodies comprises a relatively large percentage of its sales it is anticipated that scrap steel prices will continue to have a negative impact on operating margins during 2016 given the decrease in scrap steel prices throughout 2015 and projected softness in 2016 and the corresponding negative effect on our current and expected results we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for the self service reporting unit as of august 31 2015 based on the step one analysis performed for the self service reporting unit no impairment adjustment was required our forecasts assume scrap steel prices will continue at their current depressed level through all of 2016 before returning to our seven year historical average price of approximately 200 per ton in 2018 based on this forecast the impairment test indicated the fair value of the self service reporting unit determined using both market and income approaches exceeded the reporting unit’s carrying value by approximately 11 declines in expected future cash flows which are driven by scrap steel and other metals prices reduction in terminal value growth rates or an increase to the riskadjusted discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the self service reporting unit may result in the determination that an impairment adjustment is required 

as of december 31 2015  we had a total of 23 billion  in goodwill subject to future impairment tests with approximately 2590 million allocated to our self service reporting unit we determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2015  on all four reporting units a 10 decrease in the fair value estimates of the reporting units in the annual impairment test would not have changed this determination but the excess over carrying value for our self service reporting unit was 11 in the most recent test if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results

year ended december 31 2015  compared to year ended december 31 2014   

revenue  the following table summarizes the changes in revenue by category amounts in thousands 



the change in parts and services revenue of 103  represents increases of 68 in north america 8 in europe and 306 in specialty the decline in other revenue of 267  primarily reflects the decline in the price of scrap steel and other metals refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to revenue changes during 2015 compared to the prior year 

cost of goods sold  our cost of goods sold decreased to 606  of revenue for the year ended december 31 2015 from 607  of revenue in the prior year the decrease is related to i a decline of 03 in costs of goods sold in our european operations as a result of a 02 decrease in our uk operations due to lower product costs and 01 due to internalizing gross margin from our may 2014 acquisitions of seven netherlands distributors and ii improved net pricing to customers in our north american operations as our purchase costs were flat on average the increase in revenue from favorable pricing resulted in a decrease of 02 in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue these decreases were offset by i an increase of 02 in our specialty operations due to higher inventory costs and unfavorable net customer pricing and ii a negative mix effect of 03 primarily resulting from growth of our specialty segment from our october 2014 acquisition of a supplier of parts for recreational vehicles as this business yields lower gross margins than our north american and european segments refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the change in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue by segment for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the prior year 

facility and warehouse expenses  as a percentage of revenue facility and warehouse expenses for the year ended december 31 2015 decreased to 77  from 78  in the prior year compared to the prior year we experienced a negative impact on operating leverage due to a decrease in other revenue primarily as a result of declining prices of scrap steel and other metals excluding the impact of the decline in scrap and other metal prices of 01 facility and warehouse expenses would have improved by 02 primarily reflecting a positive mix effect as a greater proportion of revenue was generated from our specialty segment compared to our north american operations specialty stores a greater portion of inventory at their regional 

distribution centers the costs of which are capitalized into inventory and expensed through cost of goods sold in our north american wholesale operations most of the inventory sold by our local operations is stored on site rather than in distribution centers and the related facility and warehouse expenses of the local operations are recorded in this line item 

distribution expenses  as a percentage of revenue distribution expenses for the year ended december 31 2015 decreased to 84  from 86  in the prior year distribution expenses decreased by 04 compared to the prior year due to fuel cost savings driven by lower average prices the decline in other revenue caused a 02 loss in operating leverage due to the revenue mix shift scrap and other metals revenue has lower distribution costs than parts sales 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2015 increased to 115  from 113  in the prior year compared to the prior year other revenue decreased as a result of declining prices of scrap steel and other metals which negatively impacted our operating leverage and increased our selling general and administrative expenses as percentage of revenue by 02 excluding this impact our selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were flat over the prior year

 provision for income taxes  our effective income tax rate was 339 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 347 for the year ended december 31 2014 the lower effective tax rate in 2015 reflects a 05 benefit relative to the prior year as a result of an increase in earnings in our lower tax rate international operations in addition the effective tax rate for the current year benefited from discrete items including favorable return to provision adjustments of 19 million and the favorable settlement of a canada tax matter totaling 18 million 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries during the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded impairment charges of 20 million in our equity method investments no tax benefit was recognized related to these charges our share of net operating losses in our equity method investments totaled 41 million through the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 21 million during the prior year with our divestiture of acm parts in february 2016 we expect our equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries to be nominal in 2016 

foreign currency impact  we translate our statements of income at the average exchange rates in effect for the period relative to the average rates used in 2014 the pound sterling euro and canadian dollar rates used to translate the 2015 statements of income declined by 72 164 and 135 respectively the translation effect of the decline of these currencies against the us dollar and realized and unrealized currency losses for the year resulted in an approximately 004 negative effect on diluted earnings per share relative to the prior year

revenue  the following table summarizes the changes in revenue by category in thousands 



the change in parts and services revenue of 374 represents increases in segment revenue of 84 in north america 466 in europe and the addition of our specialty segment in 2014 refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to revenue growth during 2014 compared to the prior year 

cost of goods sold  our cost of goods sold increased to 607  of revenue in 2014 from 590  of revenue in 2013 the increase in cost of goods sold was primarily the result of lower margins generated by certain of our acquired businesses which increased cost of goods sold by 20 of revenue our keystone specialty business operates a three step distribution model which generates lower gross margins compared to our revenue from sales directly to repairers and therefore was responsible for 12 of the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue our other acquisitions completed since the beginning of the prior year were responsible for the remainder of the acquisition impact on cost of goods sold none of which had a material impact on our gross margins individually partially offsetting the impact of our acquisitions improvement in our north american gross margins decreased cost of goods sold by 04 of revenue refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in cost of goods sold by segment for the year ended  december 31 2014 compared to the year ended  december 31 2013 

facility and warehouse expenses  as a percentage of revenue facility and warehouse expenses for the year ended  december 31 2014 decreased to 78  from 84  in the prior year which was primarily due to the effect of our keystone specialty acquisition as discussed in our current year section specialty operates with lower facility and warehouse expenses than our north american operations 

distribution expenses  as a percentage of revenue distribution expenses increased to 86  in 2014 from 85  in 2013 primarily due to greater costs in our european segment in our uk operations we incurred greater personnel expenditures as a result of 59 new branch openings since the beginning of the prior year which increased distribution expenses by 01 of revenue 

selling general and administrative expenses  our selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended  december 31 2014 decreased to 113  of revenue from 118  of revenue in the prior year our acquisitions contributed 04 of the reduction in expense including primarily the effect of keystone specialty which has lower selling general and administrative costs compared to our other operations greater leverage of our sales force and general and administrative personnel in our north american operations contributed an additional 03 improvement in costs as a percentage of revenue these reductions in expense as a percentage of revenue were partially offset by greater expenses in our european operations including greater expenditures for our sales force primarily related to new branch openings and higher advertising costs compared to the prior year period which increased selling general and administrative expenses by 02 of revenue

provision for income taxes  our effective income tax rate was 347 for the year ended  december 31 2014 compared to 345 for the year ended  december 31 2013 the lower effective income tax rate in 2013 primarily reflects the discrete benefit related to the revaluation of our net uk deferred tax liabilities as a result of reductions in the uk corporate income tax rate 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries our share of net operating losses in our equity method investments totaled 21 million through the year ended december 31 2014 net operating losses during the year ended december 31 2013 were not material 

foreign currency impact  we translate our statements of income at the average exchange rates in effect for the period relative to the average rates used in 2013 the canadian dollar and euro rates used to translate the 2014 statements of income declined by 68 and 05 respectively and the pound sterling rate increased by 53 the translation effect of the change in these currencies against the us dollar and realized and unrealized currency losses for the year resulted in approximately a 001 positive effect on diluted earnings per share relative to the prior year 

results of operations—segment reporting 

we have four operating segments wholesale – north america europe specialty and self service our specialty operating segment was formed with our january 3 2014 acquisition of keystone specialty as discussed in note 8 business combinations  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k our wholesale – north america and self service operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment north america because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services customers and methods of distribution therefore we present three reportable segments north america europe and specialty 

we evaluate growth and profitability in our operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis the constant currency presentation which is a nongaap generally accepted accounting principles measure excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth and profitability consistent with how we evaluate our performance constant currency segment ebitda results are calculated by translating prior year segment ebitda in local currency using the current years currency conversion rate this nongaap measure has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap our use of this term may vary from the use of similarlytitled measures by other issuers due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation 

the following table presents our financial performance including third party revenue total revenue and segment ebitda by reportable segment for the periods indicated in thousands 



the key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker who is our chief executive officer is segment ebitda segment ebitda includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment corporate and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage with shared expenses apportioned based on the segments percentage of consolidated revenue segment ebitda is calculated as ebitda excluding restructuring and acquisition related expenses change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries ebitda which is the basis for segment ebitda is calculated as net income excluding depreciation amortization interest including loss on debt extinguishment and taxes loss on debt extinguishment is considered a component of interest in calculating ebitda as the writeoff of debt issuance costs is similar to the treatment of debt issuance cost amortization see note 13 segment and geographic information  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a reconciliation of total segment ebitda to net income

distributor margin additionally as we transition our continental european operations to a two step distribution model including the effect of these acquisitions our operating expenses will increase as we internalize the cost of the distribution network during the year ended december 31 2014 these greater operating costs resulted in a decline in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue thereby accounting for the remaining negative impact on segment ebitda margins our existing operations were responsible for the remaining decline in segment ebitda including a 07 effect from 59 new branch openings in the uk since the beginning of the prior year in our uk operations additionally we incurred 02 in higher advertising expenses compared to the prior year 

specialty 

because our specialty segment was formed on january 3 2014 with our keystone specialty acquisition the discussion of our consolidated results of operations covers the factors driving the yearoveryear performance of our existing business and also discusses the effect of the specialty operations on our consolidated results compared to keystone specialtys unaudited results for the year ended  december 31 2013 revenue in our specialty segment increased 158 during the fourth quarter of 2014 we completed two additional acquisitions in our specialty segment which contributed approximately one quarter of the revenue growth the remaining revenue growth was primarily due to greater sales volumes as a result of favorable economic conditions additionally during the year ended  december 31 2014 we generated a greater proportion of revenue from our higherend specialty vehicle products such as truck and rv accessories which resulted in a favorable mix of revenue compared to the prior year unaudited results 

2016 outlook

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes liquidity data as of the dates indicated in thousands 



1  debt amounts reflect the gross values to be repaid excluding debt issuance costs of 150 million  and 184 million  as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

2 includes our revolving credit facilities our receivables securitization facility and letters of credit the amounts do not reflect the impact of the amendment to our senior secured credit facility on january 29 2016 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through both internal development and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our credit facilities we utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures with the excess amounts going towards funding acquisitions or paying down outstanding debt as we have pursued acquisitions as part of our growth strategy our cash flows from operations have not always been sufficient to cover our investing activities to fund our acquisitions we have accessed various forms of debt financing including our march 2014 amendment to our senior secured credit facilities and the issuance of 600 million of senior notes in may 2013 

as of december 31 2015  we had debt outstanding and additional available sources of financing as follows 

   

on january 29 2016 lkq corporation lkq delaware llp and certain other subsidiaries entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement to 1 extend the maturity date by approximately two years to january 29 2021 2 increase the total availability under the credit agreement from 23 billion to 32 billion composed of 245 billion in the revolving credit facilitys multicurrency component and 750 million of term loans which consist of a term loan of approximately 500 million and a €230 million term loan 3 increase our ability to incur additional indebtedness and 4 make other immaterial or clarifying modifications and amendments to the terms of the third amended and restated credit agreement see note 4 longterm obligations  within the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information related to our longterm obligations 

from time to time we may undertake financing transactions to increase our available liquidity such as our january 2016 amendment to our senior secured credit facilities and our september 2014 amendment to our receivables securitization facility our financing structure which includes our senior secured credit facilities senior notes and receivables securitization facility provides financial flexibility to execute our longterm growth strategy if we see an attractive acquisition opportunity we have the ability to move quickly and have certainty of funding up to the amount of our thenavailable liquidity 

 as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 13 billion available under our credit facilities combined with approximately 874 million of cash and equivalents at december 31 2015  we had approximately 14 billion in available liquidity an increase of 1826 million over our available liquidity as of december 31 2014  

after giving effect to the january 2016 amendment we will have an additional 600 million  of availability under our revolving credit facilities and an increase in term loan borrowings of approximately 339 million  which combined with our existing capacity will be used to finance the potential rhiag acquisition total consideration transferred for the purchase price is expected to include approximately 616 million of cash and approximately 500 million in assumed debt we plan to refinance the assumed debt with revolver borrowings under our secured credit facility andor other long term obligations additional amounts are expected to be transferred for acquisition related costs 

we believe that our current liquidity and cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements although such sources may not be sufficient for future acquisitions depending on their size while we believe that with the amended credit facility we have adequate capacity from time to time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements there can be no assurance that additional funding or refinancing of our credit facilities if needed will be available on terms attractive to us or at all furthermore any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants or higher interest costs our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at variable rates which depend on the currency and the duration of the borrowing plus an applicable margin rate which is subject to change quarterly based on our reported leverage ratio we hold interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates on a portion of our credit agreement borrowings as described in note 5 derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k with the effect of fixing the interest rates on the respective notional amounts after giving effect to these interest rate swap contracts the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2015  was 176  including the borrowings on our senior notes and receivables securitization program our overall weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 289  at december 31 2015  cash interest payments were 549 million  for the year ended   december 31 2015  including interest payments totaling 285 million related to our senior notes the semiannual interest payments on our senior notes are made in may and november each year and began in november 2013 we had outstanding credit agreement borrowings of 09 billion  and 11 billion  at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  respectively of these amounts 225 million were classified as current maturities at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  

under the terms of the january 2016 amendment we have scheduled repayments of 31 million for the fiscal quarters ending on june 30 2016 september 30 2016 and december 31 2016 and 62 million each fiscal quarter thereafter through the maturity of the usd term loan maturity in january 2021 we also have scheduled repayments of €14 million for the fiscal quarters ending on june 30 2016 september 30 2016 and december 31 2016 and €29 million each fiscal quarter thereafter 

through the maturity of the euro term loan in january 2021 we have no other significant principal payments on our credit facilities scheduled prior to the maturity of the receivables securitization program in october 2017 in addition to the repayments under our credit facilities we will make payments on notes payable and other debt totaling 350 million in the next 12 months 

our credit agreement contains customary covenants that provide limitations and conditions on our ability to enter into certain transactions the credit agreement also contains financial and affirmative covenants including limitations on our net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our credit agreement as of december 31 2015  

as of december 31 2015  the company had cash of 874 million  of which 594 million was held by foreign subsidiaries we consider the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no provision for us income taxes has been provided thereon should these earnings be repatriated in the future in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to both us income taxes subject to adjustment for foreign tax credits and potential withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries we believe that we have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our financial obligations in the us without resort to repatriation of foreign earnings

net cash used in investing activities  totaled 3300 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to 9210 million  in 2014  we invested 1605 million  of cash net of cash acquired in business acquisitions during 2015  compared to 7759 million  for business acquisitions in 2014 which included 4271 million for our keystone specialty acquisition property and equipment purchases were 1705 million  in the year ended december 31 2015  compared to 1410 million  in the prior year the increase in capital expenditures relative to the prior year period reflects an increase of 330 million in our uk operations primarily due to costs incurred to develop and equip a new distribution center during 2015  cash provided by other investing activities net was  10 million and primarily consisted of proceeds from disposals of fixed assets totaling 107 million partially offset by payments of 97 million for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries including a 75 million payment to increase our investment in acm parts during 2014  we paid 22 million for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facilities where interest rates are tied to the prime rate libor or cdor therefore we implemented a policy to manage our exposure to variable interest rates on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt instruments through the use of interest rate swap contracts these contracts convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt matching the currency effective dates and maturity dates to specific debt instruments net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swap contracts are included as adjustments to interest expense all of our interest rate swap contracts have been executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy wells fargo bank na bank of america na and rbs citizens na 

as of december 31 2015  we held five interest rate swap contracts representing a total of 170 million of us dollardenominated notional amount debt £50 million of pound sterlingdenominated notional amount debt and cad 25 million of canadian dollardenominated notional amount debt our interest rate swap contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and modify the variable rate nature of that portion of our variable rate debt these swaps have maturity dates ranging from march 2016 through december 2016 

in total we had 29 of our variable rate debt under our credit facilities at fixed rates at december 31 2015 compared to 47 at december 31 2014 as of december 31 2015  the fair market value of these swap contracts was a net liability of 13 million  the values of such contracts are subject to changes in interest rates 

at december 31 2015  we had 692 million of variable rate debt that was not hedged using sensitivity analysis a 100 basis point movement in interest rates would change interest expense by 69 million over the next twelve months 

in january 2016 we entered into four interest rate swap contracts representing a total of 200 million of us dollardenominated debt in february 2016 we entered into four additional interest rate swap contracts representing a total of 240 million of us dollardenominated debt all new swaps mature in january 2021 further information regarding our interest rate swaps is included in note 5 derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the proceeds of our may 2013 senior notes offering were used to finance our eurodenominated acquisition of sator as well as to repay a portion of our pound sterlingdenominated revolver borrowings held by our european operations in connection with these transactions in 2013 we entered into eurodenominated and pound sterlingdenominated intercompany notes which incurred transaction gains and losses from fluctuations in the us dollar against these currencies to mitigate these fluctuations we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to sell €1500 million for 1950 million and £700 million for 1058 million the gains or losses from the remeasurement of these contracts are recorded to earnings to offset the remeasurement of the related notes during the year ended december 31 2014 we settled these forward contracts through payments to the counterparties totaling 200 million while there are no such forward contracts outstanding as of december 31 2015 we may enter into additional foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on similar intercompany financing transactions 

additionally we are exposed to currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket products from foreign countries the majority of our foreign inventory purchases are from manufacturers based in taiwan while our transactions with manufacturers based in taiwan are conducted in us dollars changes in the relationship between the us dollar and the taiwan dollar might impact the purchase price of aftermarket products our aftermarket operations in canada which also purchase inventory from taiwan in us dollars are further subject to changes in the relationship between the us dollar and the canadian dollar our aftermarket operations in the uk also source a portion of their inventory from taiwan as well as from other european countries and china resulting in exposure to changes in the relationship of the pound sterling against the euro and the us dollar we hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations for certain of our purchases in our european operations but the notional amount and fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2015  were immaterial we do not currently attempt to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in our north american operations and we may not be able to pass on any price increases to our customers 

foreign currency fluctuations may also impact the financial results we report for the portions of our business that operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar our operations in europe and other countries represented 328 and 332 of our revenue during 2015 and 2014 respectively an increase or decrease in the strength of the us dollar against these currencies by 10 would result in a 3  change in our consolidated revenue and our operating income for the year ended december 31 2015  

other than with respect to our intercompany transactions denominated in euro and pound sterling and a portion of our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in the uk we do not hold derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency risk our net investment in foreign operations is partially hedged by the foreign currency denominated borrowings we use to fund foreign acquisitions additionally we have elected not to hedge the foreign currency risk related to the interest payments 

on these borrowings as we generate canadian dollar pound sterling and euro cash flows that can be used to fund debt payments as of december 31 2015  we had amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities of €2477 million £733 million cad 1304 million and kr780 million as of december 31 2014 we had amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities of €2165 million £962 million and cad 1304 million since december 31 2013 we have replaced certain of our us dollar denominated borrowings with foreigncurrency denominated borrowings primarily in europe which more closely aligns the functional currency of our borrowings and the cash flows used to fund debt payments 

we are also exposed to market risk related to price fluctuations in scrap metal and other metals market prices of these metals affect the amount that we pay for our inventory as well as the revenue that we generate from sales of these metals as both our revenue and costs are affected by the price fluctuations we have a natural hedge against the changes however there is typically a lag between the effect on our revenue from metal price fluctuations and inventory cost changes and there is no guarantee that the car costs will decrease at the same rate as the metal prices therefore we can experience positive or negative gross margin effects in periods of rising or falling metals prices particularly when such prices move rapidly if market prices were to fall at a greater rate than our vehicle acquisition costs we could experience a decline in operating margin scrap metal and other metal prices declined in 2015 and have decreased 56 since the fourth quarter of 2014 as of december 31 2015  we held shortterm metals forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in metals prices specifically related to our precious metals refining and reclamation business the notional amount and fair value of these forward contracts at december 31 2015  were immaterial

 item 1 business 

overview 

lkq corporation lkq or the company is a distributor of vehicle products including replacement parts components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles as well as specialty vehicle products and accessories 

buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers oems which are commonly known as oem products new products produced by companies other than the oems which are sometimes referred to as aftermarket products recycled products obtained from salvage vehicles used products that have been refurbished and used products that have been remanufactured we distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops including aftermarket collision and mechanical products recycled collision and mechanical products refurbished collision products such as wheels bumper covers and lights and remanufactured engines collectively we refer to these products as alternative parts because they are not new oem products 

we are the nation’s largest provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and a leading provider of alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products with our sales processing and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the united states and canada we are also a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement and maintenance products in the united kingdom and the benelux region of continental europe in addition to our wholesale operations we operate self service retail facilities across the us that sell recycled automotive products from endoflifevehicles with our january 2014 acquisition of keystone automotive holdings inc “keystone specialty” as discussed in note 8 business combinations to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we are also a leading distributor of specialty vehicle products and accessories reaching most major markets in the us and canada 

we are organized into four operating segments wholesale  north america wholesale  europe self service and specialty our specialty operating segment was formed with our january 2014 acquisition of keystone specialty we aggregate our wholesale  north america and self service operating segments into one reportable segment north america resulting in three reportable segments north america europe and specialty see note 13 segment and geographic information to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for financial information by reportable segment and by geographic region 

we strive to be environmentally responsible our recycled automotive products provide an alternative to the manufacture of new products which would require the expenditure of more resources and energy and would generate additional pollution in addition we save landfill space because the parts that we recycle would otherwise be discarded we also collect materials such as metals plastics fuel and motor oil from the salvage vehicles that we procure and use them in our operations or sell them to other users 

history 

lkq was initially formed in 1998 through the combination of a number of wholesale recycled products businesses located in florida michigan ohio and wisconsin we subsequently expanded through internal development and over 200 acquisitions of aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured product suppliers and manufacturers self service retail businesses and specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories suppliers our most significant acquisitions include 

  further information regarding our acquisitions is included in note 8 business combinations to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

strategy 

we are focused on creating economic value for our stockholders by enhancing our position as a leading source for alternative collision and mechanical repair products and by expanding into other product lines and businesses that may benefit from our operating strengths we believe a supply network with a broad inventory of quality alternative collision and mechanical repair products and specialty vehicle aftermarket products high fulfillment rates and superior customer service provides us with a competitive advantage 

other than oems the competition in the markets that we serve is extremely fragmented and the supply of products tends to be localized often leading to low fulfillment rates particularly with recycled products in north america the distribution channels for aftermarket and refurbished products have historically been distinct and separate from those for recycled and remanufactured products despite serving the same customer segment we provide value to our customers by bringing these two channels together to provide a broader product offering and more efficient distribution process 

to execute our strategy in north america we have expanded our network of parts warehouses and dismantling plants in major metropolitan areas and employ a distribution system that allows for order fulfillment from regional warehouses located across the us and canada by increasing local inventory levels and expanding our network to provide timely access to a greater range of parts we have increased fulfillment rates beyond the levels that we believe most of our competitors realize particularly for recycled products 

in our european operations we are expanding our branch network in the uk while simultaneously transitioning our distribution network in our continental european operations by internalizing certain distributor customers so that we may directly serve the repair shops in those markets we believe aligning the distribution strategy in continental europe with our twostep distribution model in the uk will create a cohesive presence in the respective markets additionally through improved order fulfillment and operational support we are attempting to improve profit margins and customer service 

 sources of high quality reliable alternatives to oem products are important to insurance companies and to our direct customers as they seek to control repair costs lower parts costs and quicker completion of orders save money and reduce repair times we believe that we provide customers and indirectly insurance companies with a value proposition that includes high quality products at a lower cost than new oem products extensive product availability due to our expansive distribution network responsive service and quick delivery the breadth of our alternative parts offerings allows us to serve as a onestop solution for our customers looking for the most cost effective way to provide quality repairs in order to execute this strategy and build on our progress thus far we will continue to seek to expand into new markets and to improve penetration both organically and through acquisitions in targeted markets 

similarly the supplier base for the specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and accessories market is highly fragmented typically consisting of suppliers that are small to mediumsized independent businesses that focus on a narrow product or market niche while our specialty operations had an extensive distribution network already in place we are in process of integrating the distribution network for our north american and specialty operations to create synergies and efficiencies with our existing infrastructure we believe this provides added value to our customers through a broader product offering and more efficient distribution process 

extensive inplace network 

we have invested significant capital to develop a network of alternative parts facilities across our operating segments we believe our extensive network gives us a distinct ability to benefit the major automobile insurance companies which are generally operated on a national or regional level additionally the difficulty and time required to obtain proper zoning as well as dismantling and other environmental permits necessary to operate newlysited recycled parts facilities would make establishing a new network of recycled parts locations a challenge for a competitor there are also difficulties associated with recruiting and hiring an experienced management team that has strong industry knowledge 

we are attempting to utilize a similar strategy in europe with our acquisition of ecp and our acquisitions of sator and certain of its distributors these companies have a national presence in their respective countries and we are working to integrate the operations to take advantage of shared procurement warehousing and product offerings 

strong business relationships 

we have developed business relationships with key constituents including automobile insurance companies suppliers and other industry participants insurance companies as payers for most collision repairs help drive demand and take active roles in the selection of alternative replacement products for vehicle repairs in order to minimize the repair portion of the claims costs and reduce repair time the use of our products lowers the cost of repairs decreases the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and provides a replacement product that is of high quality and comparable performance to the part replaced all of which are favorable to insurance companies because of their importance to the process we have formed 

relationships with certain insurance companies in north america for which we are designated a preferred products supplier we are in the process of establishing similar relationships with insurance companies in europe 

we also provide quality assurance programs that offer additional product support to automobile insurance companies these product support programs identify specific subsets of aftermarket products by vendor and product type that can be used in the repair of vehicles that these companies insure the programs typically offer aftermarket products that have been produced by manufacturers certified by a third party testing lab we may provide additional validation of the quality of the products beyond our standard warranties and identification details that make the products traceable back to a manufacturers specific production run 

broad product offering 

the breadth and depth of our inventory across all of our operating segments reinforces lkqs ability to provide a onestop solution for our customers alternative vehicle replacement maintenance and specialty vehicle product needs customers place a high value on the availability of a broad range of vehicle replacement products in our north american operations we are able to provide the collision and mechanical repair industry with premium products at costs typically 20 to 50 below new oem replacement products the availability of alternative products means that automobiles can be repaired with lower parts costs and in some instances reduced labor costs in fact many insurance companies in north america will not authorize the use of higher cost new oem replacement products if alternative products are available because the use of alternative products provides insurers a method to manage and reduce total repair costs some insurance companies designate us as a preferred supplier for their affiliated repair shops because of our ability to provide these products with our distribution network that reaches most of the major markets in the us and canada combined with our extensive range of products we believe we are the only supplier that is able to support the insurance industry in this manner we leverage this same distribution network to provide a broad offering of specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories used to customize or enhance the performance handling or appearance of new or used vehicles additionally we believe we are wellpositioned in europe to develop a similar distribution network of a broad offering of vehicle replacement products to support insurance companies in that market 

high fulfillment rates 

we manage local inventory levels to improve delivery time and maximize customer service improving local order fulfillment rates reduces transfer costs and delivery times and improves customer satisfaction our ability to move inventory throughout our distribution networks increases the availability of our products and also helps us to fill a higher percentage of our customers requests 

we deploy inventory management systems at our facilities that are similar to those used by other leading distribution companies for example we make extensive use of bar code technology and wireless data transmission to track parts from the time a vehicle or product arrives at a facility to its placement on a truck for delivery to the customer with this realtime information we are able to actively monitor inventory levels throughout our distribution channels 

technology driven business processes 

we focus on technology development as a way to support our competitive advantage we believe that we can more cost effectively leverage our data to make better business decisions than our smaller competitors we continue to develop our technology to better manage and analyze our inventory assist our salespeople with uptodate pricing and availability of our products and further enhance our inventory procurement process 

we employ proprietary methodologies and information systems to help us identify high demand wholesale aftermarket and recycled products our aftermarket inventory systems track products sold and sales lost due to a lack of inventory and make purchase recommendations based on this information the inventory systems also recommend purchases and transfers based on the extent and location of demand as well as other replenishment factors when we procure aftermarket products or refurbish collision replacement products such as wheels bumper covers and lights we focus on products that are in the most demand at all levels of the automotive parts value chain including the professional repair market the jobber market and the general insured repair market because lead times may take 40 days or more on imported products sales volume and instock inventory are important factors in the procurement process we use historical sales records of vehicles by model and year to estimate the demand for our products we also analyze new vehicle designs that are expected to come to market to assure that we are working with suppliers to project future supply and demand trends combining this information with proprietary data that aggregate customer requests for products we are able to source aftermarket products and salvage vehicles at prices that we believe will allow us to sell products profitably 

within our specialty vehicle aftermarket and accessories business we believe a focus on technology allows us to develop our business processes and enhance the customer experience our inventory forecasting systems help us ensure that the correct product is stocked in the right place to meet customer demand our warehousing and logistics systems help us deliver 

products to customers across the united states and canada our online catalogs offer industry leading product information across all segments of automotive and rv aftermarket parts and accessories and allow customers to search compare and order products based upon the specifications of a vehicle furthermore enhancements to our phone systems allow us to improve our customer support capability and the overall customer experience 

north america segment 

wholesale automotive products 

our wholesale automobile product operations in north america are organized by geographic regions serving the us and canada that sell all four product types aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured parts to collision and mechanical automobile repair businesses our combined distribution channels for our alternative parts offerings leverage our facility and warehouse costs and improve local product availability by locating multiple product operations together our aftermarket product operations may include a combination of sales warehousing and distribution and in many cases will be colocated with our refurbishing operations our salvage operations typically have processing sales distribution and administrative operations on site indoor and outdoor storage areas and include a large warehouse with multiple bays to dismantle vehicles our engine remanufacturing operations are conducted primarily at our facility in mexico with sales warehousing and distribution operations in the us as of december 31 2014 our north american wholesale operations conducted business from 347 facilities 

wholesale aftermarket products 

our 2014 sales included more than 101000 skus of aftermarket automotive products excluding refurbished products for the most common models of domestic and foreign automobiles and light trucks primarily for the repair of vehicles three to twelve years old our principal aftermarket product types consist of those most frequently damaged in collisions including bumper covers automotive body panels and lights in recent years our expansion into complementary product types such as paint and cooling products contributed to the increase in our available products and has allowed us to better meet our customers repair needs 

platinum plus is our exclusive product line offered in the keystone brand of aftermarket products the platinum plus products are held to high quality standards and tested by quality assurance teams or independent third parties we also developed a product line called value line for more value conscious often selfpay consumers our value line products offer quality products at reasonable prices providing additional choices for repairs or rebuilding of vehicles 

certain of our products are certified by independent organizations such as the certified automotive parts association capa and nsf international nsf capa and nsf are associations that evaluate the functional equivalence of aftermarket collision replacement products to oem collision replacement products members of capa and nsf include insurance companies product distributors including lkq collision repair shops and consumers capa and nsf develop engineering specifications for aftermarket collision replacement products based upon examinations of oem products certify the factories manufacturing processes and quality control procedures used by independent manufacturers and certify the materials fit and finish of specific aftermarket collision replacement products 

lkq is certified under the nsf international automotive parts distributor certification program which addresses the needs of collision repair shops and insurers by maintaining quality management systems to address part traceability service and quality this certification program complements the existing parts certification program with nsf under which lkq has a broad range of certified automotive collision replacement parts many major insurance companies have adopted policies recommending or requiring the use of products certified by capa or nsf a number of capa and nsf certified products are also marketed under the platinum plus brand 

we distribute paint and other materials used in repairing damaged vehicles including sandpaper abrasives masking products and plastic filler the paint and other materials distributed by us are purchased from numerous suppliers in the us and canada 

procurement of inventory 

the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from independent manufacturers and distributors located primarily in the us taiwan and china in 2014 approximately 37 of our aftermarket purchases were made from our top four vendors with our largest vendor providing approximately 13 of our inventory we believe we are one of the largest customers of each of these suppliers outside of this group no other supplier provided more than 5 of our supply of aftermarket products in 2014 we purchased approximately 45 of our aftermarket products in 2014 directly from manufacturers in taiwan and other asian countries approximately 55 of our aftermarket products were purchased from vendors located in the us and canada however we believe the majority of these products were manufactured in taiwan mexico or other foreign countries we have business arrangements with manufacturers to produce certain of our products 

these agreements automatically renew for additional 12 month periods unless written notice is given while we compete with other distributors for production capacity we believe that our sources of supply and our relationships with our suppliers are satisfactory 

we usually receive orders from domestic suppliers within ten days from the date ordered foreign orders typically are shipped in sea containers directly to certain of our aftermarket locations and are received within 40 to 65 days from the date ordered we operate an aftermarket parts warehouse in taiwan that aggregates inventory from certain of our vendors for shipment to our north american locations as of december 31 2014 we operated 25 regional hubs and three distribution centers which act as sources for our warehouse locations that do not receive containers directly and serve as redistribution centers for our operations this structure is designed to maximize our fulfillment rates as smaller branches can have a high fillrate of next day availability 

wholesale recycled products 

our recycled products include engines transmissions door assemblies sheet metal products such as trunk lids fenders and hoods lights and bumper assemblies some insurance companies mandate that the recycled products must be of the same model year or newer as the vehicle being repaired as a result the majority of the products we sell are from vehicles not more than ten years of age installing recycled products often means that collision shops not only save on product cost but because several products may come preassembled the shops are also able to reduce labor costs 

procurement of inventory 

we procure recycled products for our wholesale operations by acquiring severely damaged or totaled vehicles and then dismantling and inventorying the parts vehicles that have been declared total losses typically are sold at regional salvage auctions throughout the us and canada salvage auctions charge fees both to the suppliers of vehicles which are primarily insurance companies and to the purchasers additionally we typically pay third parties to tow the vehicles from the auction to our facilities 

the availability of the salvage vehicles we procure for our wholesale recycled product operations may be impacted by a variety of factors including the production level of new vehicles which provides the source from which salvage vehicles ultimately come and the portion of damaged vehicles declared total losses over the past several years the frequency with which vehicles are declared total losses has increased as a result¸ we believe of the rise in repair costs relative to vehicle replacement cost and salvage vehicle prices in 2000 approximately 9 of accident claims resulted in a total loss by 2013 this percentage increased to almost 14 additionally sales of new vehicles have increased since 2010 and are projected to continue to increase over the next four years which should result in a greater volume of salvage vehicles at auction 

in 2014 we acquired 284000 salvage vehicles for our wholesale recycled product operations primarily from salvage auctions prior to the scheduled auction date our salvage buyers may preview the auctions online to investigate the vehicles to be sold and determine our interest in buying them they obtain key information such as the model and mileage and perform visual damage assessments to determine which parts on the targeted vehicles are recyclable with the data from this preview we deploy a bidding system that performs a valuation calculation for each vehicle in order to recommend a maximum bid price the calculation incorporates demand for a vehicles recyclable parts current inventory levels average selling prices auction costs projected margins and instances of outofstock using this disciplined supply and demand procurement approach we place bids on the targeted vehicles 

vehicle processing 

vehicle processing for our wholesale recycled operations involves dismantling a salvage vehicle into recycled products that are ready for sale when a salvage vehicle arrives at one of our facilities an inventory specialist identifies catalogs and schedules the vehicle for dismantling prior to dismantling we remove from each vehicle its battery fluids refrigerants and parts containing hazardous substances or precious metals such as catalytic converters the extracted fluids are stored in bulk and subsequently sold to recyclers in the case of gasoline the fuel retrieved is primarily used to power our delivery vehicles a small portion of the recycled motor oil we collect is used at certain of our plants that have highefficiency oil burning furnaces the balance is sold to motor oil recyclers 

when ready for dismantling each vehicle has an inventory report that indicates to the dismantler which parts should be removed and placed in a warehouse for future sales to customers which parts should be collected in bulk for our refurbishing and remanufacturing operations or for sale to parts remanufacturers and which parts have value but should remain on the vehicle until sold we utilize bar coding systems and wireless transmission to keep track of inventory from the time a product is removed and inventoried to the time it is sold and put on a truck for delivery 

refurbished and remanufactured products 

as of december 31 2014 we operated 28 refurbishing facilities and 4 engine remanufacturing facilities we refurbish products such as wheels lights plastic bumpers and chrome bumpers 

when identifying the products that we refurbish or remanufacture we focus on products that have high demand the majority of our refurbished and remanufactured products are processed from cores obtained from salvage vehicles purchased by our recycled operations at auctions parts received in trade from customers purchasing replacement products from us and cores collected by our route delivery drivers from vehicles under repair by our customers these products are accumulated from our wholesale operations at our core sorting facilities and are then either sent to our refurbishing or remanufacturing facilities or sold in bulk to other mechanical remanufacturers 

heavyduty truck products 

as of december 31 2014 we operated a total of 26 heavyduty truck facilities in the us and canada our inventory is composed of used heavy and mediumduty trucks usually at least five years old which are purchased at salvage and truck auctions or directly from insurance companies or large fleet operators during 2014 we purchased approximately 6000 vehicles depending on the condition of the vehicles they may be dismantled for parts or resold as running vehicles if certain mechanical parts are damaged such as transmissions we may remanufacture them and offer them to our customers the vehicles that are acquired for resale are typically special purpose or vocational use trucks such as those used for garbage pickup or cement delivery if requested by the sellers of the vehicles we provide assurance that the vehicles will be sold to foreign buyers and exported to countries for use outside of the us or to domestic buyers after the vehicles have been reconditioned and modified for use other than their original purpose 

scrap and other materials 

our wholesale recycled product operations generate scrap metal and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that have been dismantled for recycled products and crush only end of life vehicles acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site in other cases we will hire mobile crushing equipment to crush the vehicles before they are transported to shredders and scrap metal processors damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products including wheels we also extract and sell the precious metals contained in certain of our salvage parts such as catalytic converters 

customers 

we sell our products to wholesale customers that include collision and mechanical repair shops and new and used car dealerships as well as to retail customers customers of our heavyduty truck products may also include owneroperators local cartage companies or exporters most of our refurbished and remanufactured products are sold through our wholesale distribution channels the balance is sold to retail automotive stores wholesale distributors and via internet sales we also generate a portion of our revenue from scrap sales to metal recyclers no single customer accounted for 2 or more of our revenue in 2014 

repair shops and others 

we sell the majority of our wholesale products to collision and mechanical repair shops industry reports estimate there were approximately 40000 collision repair shops including those owned by new car dealerships in the us in 2013 the same reports estimate there were approximately 78000 general including mechanical repair garages excluding new car dealership service departments in the us in 2013 the majority of these customers tend to be individuallyowned small businesses although the number of independent and dealeroperated collision repair facilities has declined over the last decade as regional or national multiple location operators have increased their geographic presence through acquisitions we also sell our products to car rental companies and fleet management groups 

insurance companies 

automobile insurance companies affect the demand for our collision products while insurance companies do not pay for our products directly they ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount as a result insurance companies often influence the types of products used in a repair 

our presence in most major markets in the us and canada gives us a distinctive ability to benefit the major automobile insurance companies insurance companies generally operate at a national or regional level the use of our products provides a direct benefit to these companies by lowering the cost of repairs decreasing the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and providing a replacement product that is of high quality and comparable performance to the part replaced 

we assist insurance companies by providing high quality aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured products to collision repair shops especially to repair shops that are part of an insurance companys direct repair program drp network a repair shop participating in a drp is referred potential work from the insurance company in exchange for providing assurances to the insurance company of quality timeliness and cost industry reports indicate that over half of claims paid for by the top insurance companies in 2012 were paid through a drp compared to 42 in 2009 to meet the needs of the 

drps professional repairers have been required to become fluent in claims handling we offer our repair shop customers access to our proprietary system keyless which provides a link between their estimating systems and our inventory to identify the availability of alternative products for use in their repair this data also helps insurance companies monitor the body shops compliance with its drp product guidelines that might for instance stipulate the use of the lowest cost products that meet quality specifications in addition in some markets insurance companies are able to dispose of low value total loss vehicles directly to us so they can save the transaction fees associated with selling these vehicles through salvage auctions 

sales and marketing 

in the case of repairs paid for as a result of insurance claims which industry publications estimate are approximately 85 of all repairs insurance companies give collision repair shops information as to what type of replacement products are eligible for reimbursement typically insurance carriers have established a hierarchy or decision tree prioritizing the types of products to be used for repairs as an example a protocol may require recycled products if available if recycled products are not available then refurbished products and if recycled or refurbished products are not available aftermarket products if none of these alternative product types is available the shop may then use new oem replacement products as a body shop looks for products for a repair the sourcing of products typically begins with a call to one of our recycled operations or one of our competitors our recycled sales personnel are encouraged to capture the sale as a onestop shop and if recycled products are out of stock to fill orders from our refurbished or aftermarket product inventory to support these efforts we have provided our sales staff with access to both recycled and aftermarket sales systems and we have developed sales incentive programs that encourage cross selling throughout our wholesale operations 

as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 2300 fulltime sales staff in our north american wholesale operating segment the full time sales personnel are located at sales desks at our facilities or at one of the regional call centers we operate we deploy a call routing system that redirects overflow calls to alternative call centers typically located within the same region we also operate two other call centers one to support national accounts and the other to support insurance adjusters needs and questions our sales personnel are encouraged to initiate outbound calls in addition to the inbound calls they handle our sales staff can use customer estimates from our keyless estimating system to generate sales leads for both aftermarket and recycled products 

we are continually reviewing and revising the pricing of wholesale products our pricing specialists consider factors such as recent demand levels inventory quantity on hand and turnover rates new oem product prices and local competitive pricing with the goal of optimizing revenue we set list prices and then sell items at a discount to list with the discount typically based on each customers purchasing volume we may adjust prices during the year in response to material price changes of new oem replacement products 

we believe our commitment to stock inventory in local warehouses supplemented by the inventory sharing system within our regional trading zones improves our ability to meet our customers requirements more frequently than our competitors and gives us a competitive advantage 

distribution 

we have a distribution network of 347 wholesale plants and warehouses across the us and canada as of december 31 2014 of which 63 function as cross dock facilities our network of facilities allows us to develop and maintain our relationships with local repair shops while providing a level of service that is made possible by our nationwide presence our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries as required by our customers using drivers who routinely deliver to the same customers our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network 

we have developed an internal distribution network to allow our sales representatives to sell our products within regional trading zones thus improving our ability to fulfill customer requests and accelerating inventory turnover each weekday we operate over 310 transfer runs between our cross dock facilities and our plants and warehouses within our regional trading zones to redistribute our alternative products for delivery on the next day in addition we have over 2700 local delivery routes serving our customers each weekday 

each sale results in the generation of a work order at the location housing the specific product a dispatcher is then responsible for ensuring fulfillment accuracy printing the final invoice and including the product on the appropriate truck route for delivery to the customer in markets where we offer more than one alternative product type we are integrating the delivery of multiple product types on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs and improve customer service we operate a delivery fleet of mediumsized trucks and smaller trucks and vans over time we expect that our delivery vehicles will become more consistent as we reconfigure the fleet to include vehicles that can carry all four product types 

competition 

we consider all suppliers of vehicle collision and mechanical products to be competitors including aftermarket suppliers recycling businesses refurbishing operations parts remanufacturers oems and internetbased suppliers we believe the principal areas of differentiation in our industry include availability of inventory pricing product quality and service 

the aftermarket product distribution business is highly fragmented and our competitors other than oems are generally independently owned distributors with one to three distribution centers similarly we compete with domestic vehicle product recyclers most of which are singleunit operators in some markets smaller competitors have organized affiliations to share marketing and distribution resources including internet sites we compete with alternative parts distributors on the basis of our nationwide distribution system our product lines and inventory availability customer service our relationships with insurance companies and to a lesser extent price we do not consider retail chains that focus on the doityourself market to be our direct competitors since many of our wholesale product sales are paid for by insurance companies rather than the end user 

manufacturers of new original equipment products sell the majority of automobile collision replacement products we believe however that the insurance and repair industries recognize advantages of using aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured products for collision repairs industry sources estimate that alternative collision parts usage in the united states ranged between 36 and 37 during 2014 we compete with oems primarily on the basis of price and to a lesser extent on service and product quality 

self service retail products 

our self service retail operations sell parts from older cars and lightduty trucks directly to consumers in addition to revenue from the sale of parts core and scrap we charge a nominal admission fee to access the property our self service facilities typically consist of a fenced or enclosed area of several acres with vehicles stored outdoors and a retail building through which customers are able to access the yard as of december 31 2014 we conducted our self service operations from 71 facilities in north america most of which operate under the name lkq pick your part 

inventory 

we acquire inventory for our self service retail product operations from a variety of sources including but not limited to towing companies auctions the general public municipality sales insurance carriers and charitable organizations we typically procure salvage vehicles that are more than seven model years old for our self service retail product operations these vehicles are generally older and of lower quality than the salvage vehicles we purchase for our wholesale recycled product operations in 2014 we purchased approximately 514000 lower cost self service and crush only vehicles 

vehicles are delivered to our locations by the seller or we arrange for transportation once on our property minimal labor is required to process the vehicle other than removing the battery fluids refrigerants catalytic converters and hazardous materials vehicles are then placed in the yard for customers to remove parts the vehicle inventory is usually organized according to domestic and import cars further organized by make passenger vans and trucks in our self service business availability of a specific part will depend on which vehicles are currently at the site and to what extent parts may have been previously sold we usually keep a vehicle at our facility for 30 to 90 days depending on the capacity of the yard and size of the market before it is crushed and sold to scrap metal processors by maintaining a relatively short turnover period we ensure that our inventory is continually updated with different car options or removed from the yard when the saleable parts are depleted 

scrap and other materials 

our self service operations generate scrap metal alloys and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that we no longer make available to the public and crush only vehicles acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site 

customers 

the customers of our self service yards are frequently doityourself mechanics small independent repair shops servicing older vehicles and auto rebuilders the scrap from the vehicle hulks when not processed by us is sold to metals recyclers with whom we may also compete when procuring salvage vehicles for our operations 

sales and marketing 

we list part prices for automobiles and lightduty trucks on regularly updated price sheets with prices varying by part type but not by make or model for instance four cylinder engines are priced the same regardless of vehicle make model age or condition while we do not consider retail automotive chains to be our direct competitors as their product offerings are focused on maintenance products and mechanical parts we may reference their prices on certain parts as a benchmark to ensure our prices remain competitive 

competition 

there are competitors operating self service businesses in all of the markets in which we operate in some markets there are numerous competitors often operating in close proximity to our operations we try to differentiate our business by the quality of the inventory and the size and cleanliness of the property 

europe segment 

wholesale automotive products 

our european wholesale operating segment was formed in the fourth quarter of 2011 with our acquisition of ecp a leading distributor of automotive aftermarket parts in the uk ecp has approximately 9000 employees with a large customer base of both commercial and retail accounts more than 75 of ecp’s revenue comes directly from the professional repair segment ecp’s main national distribution center supports its regional hubs and branch network with daily replenishment of stock providing our customers with what we believe to be the highest instock rate in the uk as of december 31 2014 we operated 214 selling locations supported by 3 national distribution centers and 12 regional hubs many of which are colocated with selling locations which allows us to reach most major markets within the uk 

in march 2012 we launched our european aftermarket collision parts program through our ecp branch network we believe the historically low alternative collision parts usage percentage in europe which is currently less than 10 provides an opportunity for us in this segment particularly as insurance companies look to lower their costs to further our commitment to expanding our european alternative collision parts program and becoming a leading onestop shop supplier to the collision repair industry in the uk we also offer automotive paint products and related accessories 

in may 2013 we acquired sator which allowed us to expand our presence in europe to continental europe headquartered in schiedam the netherlands sator is a market leading distributor of automotive aftermarket parts in western europe the acquisition of sator expands lkqs european footprint further expands our european distribution network and provides a potential platform to capitalize on the large and fragmented mechanical replacement part markets in europe sator also complements our existing ecp operations in the uk by allowing for potential cost savings from the leveraging of our combined purchasing power given the significant overlap in suppliers and product mix in 2014 we began to align sators distribution model with that of our uk operations through the acquisition of seven warehouse distributors five of which were customers of sator these acquisitions are integral to our plan to implement a two step distribution model under which we are selling directly to repair shops to improve our margins and drive product sales 

sator has over 2000 employees at 75 aftermarket warehouses that serve a diverse base of repair shop and warehouse distributor customers in 2014 sators sales included 171000 skus sator generates approximately 90 of its revenue from sales in the netherlands and belgium with the remainder in northern france and other european countries with their respective distribution networks it infrastructure and unique customer base we believe ecp and sator will serve as a platform to expand into complementary products to increase market penetration in this segment as well as to further develop a collision repair parts business throughout europe similar to our wholesale operations in north america 

in november 2014 we expanded our european segment to include salvage operations through our acquisition of a business with salvage and vehicle repair facilities in sweden and norway in addition to expanding our geographic presence in continental europe we believe the acquisition provides us with the opportunity to leverage our experience in operating salvage facilities in a new market and leaves us well positioned to expand our aftermarket operations to include these countries 

inventory 

our inventory is primarily composed of mechanical aftermarket parts for the repair of vehicles 3 to 15 years old our top selling products include brake pads discs and sensors electrical products such as spark plugs and batteries clutches filters and oil and automotive fluids in 2014 our top six suppliers represented 31 of our inventory purchases with our top supplier representing approximately 10 of our purchases no suppliers outside of our top six suppliers provided more than 3 of our purchases during 2014 

the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from vendors located primarily in the uk and continental europe in 2014 we purchased 90 of our products from companies in europe the remaining 10 of our 2014 purchases were sourced from vendors located primarily in china or taiwan some of which also supply collision parts for our wholesale  north american operations in 2014 46 44 and 10 of our total inventory purchases were made in euros pounds sterling and us dollars respectively 

customers 

in our uk operations we sell the majority of our products to nearly 35000 customers primarily consisting of professional repairers including both independent mechanical repair shops and collision repair shops in addition to our sales to repair shops we generate a portion of our revenue through sales to retail customers from ecp’s ecommerce platform and from 

counter sales at the branch locations this retail component of ecp’s business has historically represented less than 10 of its revenue 

historically our distribution network in continental europe operated under a threestep distribution model where the immediate customer was the warehouse distributor we are in the process of transforming the distribution model to a twostep distribution model by internalizing those warehouse distributors our customer base currently consists of a combination of warehouse distributors and local repair shops and the demand for our products is driven by the needs of the same types of professional repairers we service in our ecp operations sator markets directly to the mechanical repair shops through fliers and other promotional materials and provides software to the repair shops which the shops need for their operations during 2014 no customer accounted for more than 2 of revenue 

sales and marketing 

ecp’s customers will generally call a sales representative at the nearest branch to place an order using an electronic automotive exchange and our integrated it platform displaying inventory availability our sales representatives locate the appropriate replacement part for a customer we set list prices for our products and then apply a discount off of list primarily depending on each customers purchasing volume in 2012 we launched a businesstobusiness website with certain of our customers to enable them to place product orders online through a customized interface that includes detailed parts specifications customerspecific pricing and local branch availability and account information we believe this customer interface will result in fewer parts returns by improving order accuracy and will also reduce the time required by parts specialists to advise customers whether placed via a phone order or online customer orders are filled from the local branch or routed to another location as necessary to fill the order 

sator’s sales and marketing platform is a proprietary stock management system that provides repair shops jobbers and end users with an efficient system for ordering from our product catalog directly online through this online system sator is able to actively monitor inventory levels at all stages in the aftermarket automotive parts value chain in its markets 

similar to our north american wholesale operations insurance companies significantly influence the purchasing decisions for collision products in europe as a result we are attempting to establish business relationships with insurance companies and implement insurerbased marketing models in the uk by emphasizing the cost savings that can be achieved through the use of alternative parts as we continue to grow our collision parts offerings in the uk we believe we will be wellpositioned to serve as a lowercost alternative for insured repairs throughout europe given the majority of uk carriers offer coverage in multiple european countries outside of the uk 

distribution 

our european operations employ a distribution model in which inventory is stored at regional distribution centers or hubs with fast moving product stored at branch locations in our ecp operations or at local warehouse distributors in our sator operations for timely delivery to the repair shop customers product is moved through the distribution network on our vans or via common carrier in our ecp operations we also sometimes employ a third party motorcycle fleet to deliver parts from our branch locations to nearby repair shop customers as a result our ecp branches can deliver certain instock parts within one hour 

competition 

we view all suppliers of replacement repair products as our competitors including other alternative parts suppliers and oems and their dealer networks while we compete with all alternative parts suppliers there are few with national distribution networks like ecp and sator that can reach the majority of repair shop customers within the required delivery time we believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other alternative parts suppliers primarily through our distribution network efficient stock management systems and proprietary technology which allows us to deliver our products quickly as well as through our product lines and inventory availability pricing and service we compete with oems primarily on the basis of price service and availability 

specialty segment 

specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories 

our specialty operating segment was formed in january 2014 with our acquisition of keystone specialty keystone specialty is a leading distributor and marketer of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories in north america serving the following six product segments truck and offroad speed and performance recreational vehicle rv towing wheels tires and performance handling and miscellaneous accessories we expanded our specialty operating segment through our october 2014 acquisition of a supplier of replacement parts supplies and accessories for rvs with these acquisitions we are a leading distributor and marketer of specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories reaching most major markets in the us and canada

our 2014 sales included more than 235000 skus of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories our top selling products include trailer hitches rv products such as satellite antennas water pumps waterproofing sealants and combination washerdryer units and pickup truck bed covers the specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories we distribute are purchased from suppliers located primarily in the us canada and china specialty aftermarket suppliers are typically small to mediumsized independent businesses that focus on a narrow product or market niche due to the highly fragmented supplier base for specialty vehicle aftermarket products there is very little supplier concentration in 2014 approximately 15 of our specialty vehicle aftermarket purchases were made from our top 6 vendors with our largest vendor providing approximately 3 of our inventory 

customers 

specialty automotive and rv aftermarket accessories and equipment are purchased by our customers to improve the performance functionality and appearance of their vehicles overall the specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and accessories market contains a fragmented customer base a majority of product sales are through specialty vehicle product installation outlets automotive parts chains or mailorder in 2014 we sold products to more than 17000 customers our customers are principally small independent retailers and installers of specialty vehicle automotive equipment these businesses depend on us to provide a broad range of products rapid delivery marketing support and technical assistance in addition to traditional customers in recent years we have increased sales to several large automotive parts and online retailers during 2014 our top 2 customers accounted for 7 of revenue while no other customer accounted for more than 1 of revenue 

sales and marketing 

our employee sales force is comprised of inside sales personnel located within geographicallydisbursed call centers and outside sales personnel who call directly on customers in the field this sales force receives customer orders responds to technical and other inquiries and proactively places outbound sales calls to customers the focus of our outside sales force is to identify and acquire new customers and to further develop relationships with existing customers outside sales personnel are responsible for specific geographic regions across the united states and canada and they work with regional managers to penetrate and service new and existing markets outside sales personnel also sell valueadded marketing services such as merchandising support 

marketing programs include catalogs advertising sponsorships and promotional activities product level marketing and merchandising support and online initiatives our national footprint allows us to stage trade shows across the united states which provide an opportunity to improve sales through the showcasing of new and innovative products from our vendors directly to our customers through these sales and marketing initiatives our goal is to continue to enhance our brand and reputation as the leading distributor in the industry 

distribution 

our specialty operations employ a hubandspoke distribution model which enables us to transport products from our 15 inventorystocking warehouse distribution centers to our 50 noninventory stocking crossdocks a majority of which are colocated with our wholesale  north america operations and provide distribution points to key regional markets over 325 delivery routes are used to provide multiday per week delivery and returns of our products directly to and from our customers in all 48 continental us states and 9 canadian provinces and we ship globally to customers in over 40 countries keystone specialty also operates 18 retail stores in northeastern pennsylvania our retail stores accounted for less than 5 of specialty segment revenue in 2014 

competition 

industry participants have a variety of supply choices vendors can deliver products to market via warehouse distributors and mail order catalogs or directly to retailers andor consumers we view all suppliers of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories as our competitors while we compete with all specialty vehicle aftermarket parts suppliers there are few with national distribution networks like lkq’s that can reach the majority of customers within the optimum delivery time we believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other specialty vehicle aftermarket parts suppliers primarily through our broad product selection which encompasses popular and hardtofind items or products our distribution network and efficient stock management systems as well as through our service we compete on the basis of product breadth and depth rapid and dependable delivery marketing initiatives support services and price 

intellectual property 

we own various trade names and trademarks as a result of past acquisitions in addition to acquired trade names and trademarks we also have technology based intellectual property that includes both internally developed websites and license agreements we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any single or group of related trademarks licenses 

or registrations nor would the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property license agreement materially affect our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 29500 employees we are a party to a collective bargaining agreement with a union that represents 44 employees at our totowa new jersey facility approximately 750 of our employees at our bumper refurbishing and engine remanufacturing operations in mexico and 170 of our employees at our recycled parts facility in quebec city canada are also represented by unions other than these locations none of our employees are members of a union or participate in other collective bargaining arrangements we consider our employee relations to be good 

facilities 

our corporate headquarters are located at 500 west madison street chicago illinois 60661 we operate a field support center in nashville tennessee that performs certain centralized functions for our north american operations including accounting procurement and information systems support our specialty operations maintain primary procurement accounting and finance functions in exeter pennsylvania certain backoffice support functions for our segments are performed in bangalore india our european operations maintain procurement accounting and finance functions in wembley outside of london england and in schiedam the netherlands in addition to these offices we have numerous operating facilities that handle wholesale and self service retail product operations we operate out of more than 750 locations in total most of which are leased many of our locations stock multiple product types or serve more than one function 

included in our total locations are 216 facilities in the uk including the 500000 square foot national distribution center in tamworth that houses inventory to supply the hubs and branches of our uk operations we also operate 75 facilities in continental europe 38 facilities in canada six facilities in scandinavia two facilities in central america one facility in mexico and one facility in brazil additionally we operate an aftermarket parts warehouse in taiwan to aggregate inventory for shipment to our locations in north america 

information technology 

in our north american operations our aftermarket operations use a third party enterprise management system additional third party software packages have been implemented to leverage the centralized data and information that a single system provides such as a data warehouse to conduct enhanced analytics and reporting an integrated budgeting system an electronic data interchange tool and ecommerce tools to enhance our online businesstobusiness initiatives orderkeystonecom and keyless the systems used by our aftermarket operations are also used by all of our refurbishing operations 

our wholesale recycled product locations in north america operate an internallydeveloped proprietary enterprise management system called lkqx we believe that the use of a single system across all of our wholesale recycled product operations helps facilitate the sales process allows for continued implementation of standard operating procedures and yields improved training efficiency employee transferability access to our national inventory database management reporting and data storage the system also supports an electronic exchange process for identifying and locating parts at other select recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock our bidding specialists responsible for procuring vehicles for our wholesale salvage operations are equipped with a proprietary software application that compares the vehicles at the salvage auctions to our current inventory historical demand and recent average selling prices to arrive at an estimated maximum bid this bidding system reduces the likelihood of purchasing unneeded parts that might result in obsolete inventory 

to better serve our customers a consolidated approach has been taken for the electronic sale of aftermarket and salvage products a full suite of ecommerce services is available to approved partners that helps us improve order accuracy reduce return rate and better fit our customer workflow using these services in coordination with our partners products can be searched priced and ordered without leaving the customers own operating systems 

online sales of our specialty products take place through our ekeystonecom site the site provides customers i the ability to match products with the make and model of car thus allowing the customer to order the right part ii the product information eg pictures attributes available for review and iii the convenience of searching inventory availability and ordering the product on the site additionally the site can provide sales opportunities by suggesting other parts to purchase based on an inquiry submitted by the customer 

we operate a single enterprise system for all of our heavyduty truck operations that supports interregion sales to reduce the potential for lost sales due to outofstock parts we are also transitioning to a single it platform to support our remanufacturing operations we operate an internallydeveloped point of sale system in our self service retail operations which allows enhanced management reporting as well as improved system reliability 

our aftermarket operations in the uk use a single integrated it platform for our purchasing branch stock and finance activities which are further supported by a distribution center system to manage inventory movement our aftermarket operations in continental europe use several it systems which are linked to transfer data between systems to manage customer orders and inventory movement and for financial reporting purposes 

the hardware that supports the systems used in our operations is located in offsite data centers the centers are in secure environments with aroundtheclock monitoring redundant power backup and multiple diverse data and telecommunication routing we use separate third party provided software for our financial systems such as financial and budget reporting general ledger accounting accounts payable payroll and fixed assets we currently protect our local customer inventory and corporate consolidated data such as financial information email files and other user files with daily backups these backups are stored off site with a third party data protection vendor additionally we restrict access to customer employee and vendor data to those users that have permission granted to them as part of their job function we have made investments in various logging encryption event correlation and data loss prevention software to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and extraction of personally identifiable information of all types including that of vendors customers and employees customer credit card information is not stored within the company’s computing environment and the card information is encrypted when it is transmitted and processed for authorization 

we continually evaluate our systems with the goal of ensuring that all critical systems remain secure scalable and operational as our business grows 

regulation 

environmental compliance 

our operations and properties are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety in the us as well as other countries in which we operate these environmental laws govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials 

we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters we have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements we cannot assure you however that we will at all times be in complete compliance with such requirements 

although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly environmental laws may change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

contamination resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release storage transportation or disposal of gasoline motor oil antifreeze transmission fluid chlorofluorocarbons cfcs from air conditioners other hazardous materials or metals such as aluminum cadmium chromium lead and mercury contamination from the refurbishment of chrome plated bumpers can occur from the release of the plating material contamination can migrate onsite or offsite which can increase the risk and the amount of any potential liability 

in addition many of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use that may have involved hazardous materials as a result some of our properties may be contaminated some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination even if these owners or operators did not know of and were not responsible for such contamination these environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of treats or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties or successors to such owners or operators for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 

when we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process we analyze the risks and when appropriate perform further environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination furthermore where appropriate we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters in addition at times we or sellers from whom we purchased a business have undertaken remediation projects we do not anticipate based on currently available information and current laws that we will incur liabilities in excess of reserves to address environmental matters however in the event we discover new information or if laws change we may incur significant liabilities which may exceed our reserves 

title laws 

in some states when a vehicle is deemed a total loss a salvage title is issued whether states issue salvage titles is important to the supply of inventory for the vehicle recycling industry because an increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles currently these titling issues are a matter of state law in 1992 the us congress commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle titling registration and salvage since then legislation has been introduced seeking to establish national uniform requirements in this area including a uniform definition of a salvage vehicle the vehicle recycling industry will generally favor a uniform definition since it will avoid inconsistencies across state lines and will generally favor a definition that expands the number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage however certain interest groups including repair shops and some insurance associations may oppose this type of legislation national legislation has not yet been enacted in this area and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in the future 

anticar theft act 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any covered major part the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on vehicle recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may discourage the use by such shops of recycled products there is no pending initiative to implement the parts registration from a law enforcement point of view however there is a risk that a heightened legislative concern over safety of parts might precipitate an effort to push for the implementation of such rules 

legislation affecting automotive repair parts 

most states have laws relating to the use of aftermarket products in motor vehicle collision repair work the provisions of these laws may include consumer disclosure vehicle owners consent regarding the use of aftermarket products in the repair process and the requirement to have aftermarket products certified by an independent testing organization some jurisdictions have laws that regulate the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags additional laws of this kind may be enacted in the future an increase in the number of states passing such legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on our business additionally congress could enact federal legislation restricting the use of aftermarket and recycled automotive products used in the course of collision repair 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related accidents which generate repairs we expect our specialty operations to generate greater revenue and earnings in the first half of the year when vehicle owners tend to install specialty products 




 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

our operating results and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the economic and political conditions in the us and elsewhere 

changes in economic and political conditions in the us and other countries in which we are located or do business could have a material effect on our company changes in such conditions have in some periods resulted in fewer miles driven fewer accident claims and a reduction of vehicle repairs all of which could negatively affect our business our sales are also impacted by changes to the economic health of vehicle owners the economic health of vehicle owners is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit taxation fuel prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside of our control if any of these conditions worsen our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities and interest rate swap transactions these unfavorable events affecting our business partners could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we face intense competition from local national international and internetbased vehicle products providers and this competition could negatively affect our business 

the vehicle replacement products industry is highly competitive and is served by numerous suppliers of oem recycled aftermarket refurbished and remanufactured products within each of these categories of suppliers there are local owneroperated companies larger regional suppliers national and international providers and internetbased suppliers providers of vehicle replacement products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of vehicle replacement products which may further increase competition some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise greater financial technical manufacturing distribution and other resources longer operating histories lower cost structures and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries or with consumers than we do in certain regions of the us local vehicle recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in the wholesale recycled products industry similarly in europe some local companies are part of cooperative efforts to compete in the aftermarket parts industry as a result of these factors our competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply provide their products at lower costs or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve 

we believe that a majority of collision parts by dollar amount are supplied by oems with the balance being supplied by distributors like us the oems are therefore in a position to exert pricing pressure in the marketplace we compete with the oems primarily on price and to a lesser extent on service and quality from time to time oems have experimented with reducing prices on specific products to match the lower prices of alternative products if such price reductions were to become widespread it could have a material adverse impact on our business 

claims by oems relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business 

oems and other manufacturers have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims the oems have brought such claims in federal court and with the us international trade commission 

to the extent oems and other manufacturers are seeking and obtaining more design patents than they have in the past and are successful in asserting infringement of these patents and defending their validity we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business we will likely incur significant expenses investigating and defending intellectual property infringement claims in addition aftermarket products certifying organizations may revoke the certification of parts that are the subject of the claims lack of certification may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of aftermarket products only if they have been certified by an independent certifying organization 

in december 2005 and may 2008 ford global technologies llc filed complaints with the international trade commission against us and others alleging that certain aftermarket products imported into the us infringed on ford design patents the parties settled these matters in april 2009 pursuant to a patent license arrangement that expires in march 2015 in january 2014 chrysler group llc filed a complaint against us in the us district court in the eastern district of michigan contending that certain aftermarket parts we sell infringe chrysler design patents relating to the dodge ram pickup truck the parties settled this matter in june 2014 pursuant to a patent license arrangement that expires in june 2019 in the event that these license arrangements or other similar license arrangements with oems are terminated or we are unable to agree upon renewal terms we may be subject to costs and uncertainties of litigation as well as restrictions on our ability to sell aftermarket parts that replicate parts covered by design patents 

an adverse change in our relationships with our suppliers or auction companies or a disruption to our supply of inventory could increase our expenses and impede our ability to serve our customers 

our business is dependent on a relatively small number of suppliers of aftermarket products a large portion of which are sourced from taiwan we incur substantial freight costs to import parts from our suppliers many of whom are located in asia if the cost of freight rose we might not be able to pass the cost increases on to our customers furthermore although 

alternative suppliers exist for substantially all aftermarket products distributed by us the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on us until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced providing products in addition we are subject to disruptions from work stoppages and other labor disputes at port facilities through which we import our inventory moreover our operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad including among other things natural disasters transportation costs and delays political instability currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs import and export controls and other nontariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas as well as the uncertainty regarding future relations between china japan and taiwan because a substantial volume of our sales involves products manufactured from sheet metal we can be adversely impacted if sheet metal becomes unavailable or is only available at higher prices which we may not be able to pass on to our customers additionally as manufacturers convert to raw materials other than steel it may be more difficult or expensive to source aftermarket parts made with such materials and it may be more difficult for repair shops to work with such materials in the repair process 

  

most of our salvage and a portion of our self service inventory is obtained from vehicles offered at salvage auctions operated by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the us we do not typically have contracts with the auction companies according to industry analysts a small number of companies control a large percentage of the salvage auction market in the us if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions began competing with us or significantly raised its fees our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers moreover we face competition in the purchase of vehicles from direct competitors rebuilders exporters and others to the extent that the number of bidders increases it may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold for wholesale recycled products some states regulate bidders to help ensure that salvage vehicles are purchased for legal purposes by qualified buyers auction companies have been actively seeking to reduce circumvent or eliminate these regulations which would further increase the number of bidders in addition there is a limited supply of salvage vehicles in the us as we grow and our demand for salvage vehicles increases the costs of these incremental vehicles could be higher 

we also acquire inventory directly from insurance companies oems and others to the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue these arrangements our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers 

we rely upon insurance companies to promote the usage of alternative parts 

our success depends in part on the acceptance and promotion of alternative parts usage by automotive insurance companies alternative parts usage has generally increased over the past ten years but has stabilized recently there can be no assurance that such usage will be maintained or will increase in the future in addition in some places we operate alternative parts usage is relatively low we also rely on business relationships with insurance companies these insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide the business relationships include in some cases participation in aftermarket quality and service assurance programs that may result in a higher usage of our aftermarket products than would be the case without the programs our arrangements with these companies may be terminated by them at any time including in connection with their own business concerns relating to the offering availability standards or operations of the aftermarket quality and service assurance programs we rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in an illinois lawsuit involving state farm mutual automobile insurance company avery v state farm a jury decided in october 1999 that state farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using nonoem replacement products to repair damaged vehicles when use of such products did not restore the vehicle to its preloss condition the jury found that state farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of nonoem replacement products and the alleged inferiority of those products the jury assessed damages against state farm of 456 million and the judge assessed an additional 730 million of disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the illinois consumer fraud act in april 2001 the illinois appellate court upheld the verdict but reduced the damage award by 130 million because of duplicative damage awards on august 18 2005 the illinois supreme court reversed the awards made by the circuit court and found among other things that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any breach of contract by state farm the us supreme court declined to hear an appeal of this case as a result of this case some insurance companies reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket products our financial results could be adversely affected if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled products from us due to a fear of similar claims 

we may not be able to sell our products due to existing or new laws and regulations prohibiting or restricting the sale of aftermarket recycled refurbished or remanufactured products 

some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of 

additional recycled products in addition the federal trade commission ftc has issued guides which regulate the use of certain terms such as “rebuilt” or “remanufactured” in connection with the sale of automotive parts restrictions on the products we are able to sell and on the marketing of such products could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

most states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair work andor require enhanced disclosure or vehicle owner consent before using aftermarket products in such repair work additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future if additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business certain organizations test the quality and safety of vehicle replacement products if these organizations decide not to test a particular vehicle product or in the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product such events could adversely affect our business 

we may not be able to successfully acquire new businesses or integrate acquisitions which could cause our business to suffer 

we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms or for other reasons moreover we may not be able to identify a sufficient number of acquisition candidates at reasonable prices to maintain our growth objectives also over time we will likely seek to make acquisitions that are relatively larger as we grow larger acquisition candidates may attract additional competitive buyers which could increase our cost or could cause us to lose such acquisitions 

if we buy a company or a division of a company we may experience difficulty integrating that companys or divisions personnel and operations which could negatively affect our operating results in addition 

• the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 

• customers of the acquired company may decide not to purchase products from us 

• suppliers of the acquired company may decide not to sell products to us 

• we may experience business disruptions as a result of information technology systems conversions 

• we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning treasury management and financial reporting 

• we may be held liable for environmental tax or other risks and liabilities as a result of our acquisitions some of which we may not have discovered during our due diligence 

• we may intentionally assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire which could result in material adverse affects on our business 

• our existing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention 

• we may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated either in the amount or in the time frame that we expect and 

• we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition the issuance of which could involve the imposition of restrictive covenants or be dilutive to our existing stockholders 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control future factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to those listed in the special note on forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k accordingly our results of operations may not be indicative of future performance these fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below our published financial guidance and the expectations of public markets which could cause our stock price or the value of our debt instruments to decline 

fluctuations in the prices of metals and other commodities could adversely affect our financial results 

our recycling operations generate scrap metal and other metals that we sell after we dismantle a salvage vehicle for wholesale parts and after vehicles have been used in our self service retail business the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors and other remaining metals are sold to processors and brokers of metals in addition we receive crush only vehicles from other companies including oems which we dismantle and which generate scrap metal and other metals the prices of scrap and other metals have historically fluctuated sometimes significantly due to market factors in addition buyers may stop purchasing metals entirely due to excess supply to the extent that the prices of metals decrease materially or buyers stop purchasing metals our revenue from such sales will suffer and a writedown of our inventory value could be required the cost of our wholesale recycled and our self service retail inventory purchases will change as a result of fluctuating scrap metal and other metals prices in a period of falling metal prices there can be no assurance that our inventory purchasing cost will decrease the same amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal and other metals prices decline and there may be a delay between the scrap metal and other metals price reductions and any inventory cost reductions the prices of steel aluminum and plastics are components of the cost to manufacture products for our aftermarket business if the price of commodities rise and result in higher costs to us for products we sell we may not be able to pass these higher costs on to our customers 

if we determine that our goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired we may incur significant charges to our pretax income 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations in the future goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of acquisitions goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses increases in our cost of capital adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including modifications that restrict the activities of the acquired business as of december 31 2014 our total goodwill subject to future impairment testing was 23 billion for further discussion of our annual impairment test see goodwill impairment in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of item 7 in this annual report on form 10k 

we amortize other intangible assets over the assigned useful lives each of which is based upon the expected period to be benefited we review other intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in the event conditions change that affect our ability to realize the underlying cash flows associated with our intangible assets we may record an impairment charge as of december 31 2014 the value of our other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization was 246 million 

if the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines or the number of cars being repaired declines our business could suffer 

our business depends on vehicle accidents and mechanical failures for both the demand for repairs using our products and the supply of recycled remanufactured and refurbished parts thus our business is impacted by factors which influence the number andor severity of accidents and mechanical failures including but not limited to the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven the ages of drivers the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions the congestion of traffic the use of cellular telephones and other electronic equipment by drivers the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers the effectiveness of accident avoidance systems in new vehicles the reliability of new oem parts and the condition of roadways additionally an increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the need for mechanical repairs and maintenance to decline as motorists seek alternative transportation options mild weather conditions particularly during winter months tend to result in a decrease in vehicle accidents moreover a number of states and municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones or other electronic devices while driving and such restrictions could lead to a decline in accidents 

systems designed to help drivers avoid accidents are becoming more prevalent and more technologically sophisticated to the extent oems install or are mandated by law to install accident avoidance systems in their vehicles the number and severity of accidents could decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the average number of new vehicles sold annually has fluctuated from yeartoyear periods of decreased sales could result in a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road and consequently fewer vehicles involved in accidents or in need of mechanical repair or maintenance substantial further declines in automotive sales in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition in addition if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of older vehicles on the road insurance companies may find it uneconomical to repair such vehicles or there could be less costly repairs if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of newer vehicles on the road the demand generally for mechanical repairs and maintenance would likely decline due to the newer longerlasting parts in the vehicle population and mechanical failures being covered by oem warranties for the first years of a 

vehicles life moreover alternative collision and mechanical parts are less likely to be used on newer vehicles 

our business may be adversely affected by union activities and labor laws 

a small percentage of our employees are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining or similar agreements which are subject to periodic renegotiation from time to time there have been efforts to organize additional portions of our workforce and those efforts can be expected to continue in addition the us department of labor or applicable foreign government agencies could adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations that could make it significantly easier for unionization efforts to be successful also we may in the future be subject to strikes or work stoppages and other labor disruptions additional unionization efforts new collective bargaining agreements and work stoppages could materially increase our costs and reduce revenue and could limit our flexibility in terms of work schedules reductions in force and other operational matters 

we also are subject to federal and state laws and regulations such as the fair labor standards act that govern such matters as minimum wage overtime and other working conditions some of these laws are technical in nature and could be subject to interpretation by government agencies different than our interpretations efforts to comply with existing laws changes to such laws and newlyenacted laws may increase our labor costs if we were found not to be in compliance with such laws we could be subject to fines penalties and liabilities to our employees or government agencies 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits 

our operating subsidiaries must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations when we develop or acquire a new facility we must seek the approval of state and local units of government governmental agencies may resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling or refurbishing facility in their communities there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold 

if we lose our key management personnel we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives if we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel which could harm our business 

we rely on information technology and communication systems in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business 

some of the information technology systems and communication systems we use for management of our facilities and our financial functions are leased from or operated by other companies while others are owned by us in the event that the providers of these systems terminate their relationships with us or if we suffer prolonged outages of these or our own systems for whatever reason we could suffer disruptions to our operations 

in the event that we decide to switch providers or to implement upgrades or replacements to our own systems we may also suffer disruptions to our business we may be unsuccessful in the development of our own systems and we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing our own systems also our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system which period could extend longer than we anticipated 

our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and employees we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information however if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to damage to our reputation additional costs lost sales or possible regulatory action the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly changing and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our operations the function of our computer 

systems andor the availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in the closure of our distribution centers “dc”s or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory through our system on a timely basis this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states or into the other countries in which we operate and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks our business could be harmed 

we use a fleet of trucks to deliver the majority of the products we sell we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in the transportation infrastructure governmental regulation availability and price of fuel liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance and insurance premium increases in addition our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials 

under certain environmental laws we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at or migration to or from our or our predecessors past or present facilities and at independent waste disposal sites these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or was not responsible for the release of such hazardous substances 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we could be subject to product liability claims and involved in product recalls 

if customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage we could be subject to product liability claims by such customers the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we may become involved in the recall of a product that is determined to be defective the expenses of a recall and the damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

we have agreed to defend and indemnify in certain circumstances insurance companies and customers against claims and damages relating to product liability and product recalls the existence of claims or damages for which we must defend and indemnify these parties could also negatively impact our business results of operations or financial condition 

regulations that may be issued under the anticar theft act could harm our business 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any covered major part the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system 

is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on automotive parts recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may discourage the use of recycled products by such shops 

we operate in foreign jurisdictions which exposes us to foreign exchange and other risks 

we have operations in belgium canada france mexico sweden the netherlands taiwan and the uk and we may expand our operations in these countries and into other countries our foreign operations expose us to additional risks associated with international business which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition including import and export requirements and compliance with anticorruption laws such as the uk bribery act 2010 and the foreign corrupt practices act we also incur costs in currencies other than our functional currencies in the countries in which we operate we are thus subject to foreign exchange exposure to the extent that we operate in different currencies as well as exposure to foreign tax and other foreign and domestic laws in addition mexico is currently experiencing a heightened level of criminal activity that could affect our ability to maintain our supply of certain aftermarket products 

new regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and otherwise adversely impact our business  

in august 2012 as mandated by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec adopted final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals originating from the democratic republic of congo drc or adjoining countries these new requirements impose significant burdens on us public companies compliance with the rules requires substantial due diligence in an effort to determine whether products contain the conflict minerals the results of such due diligence efforts must be disclosed on an annual basis in a filing with the sec 

our supply chain is complex and we may incur significant costs to determine the source of any such minerals used in our products we may also incur costs with respect to potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of our diligence activities further the implementation of these rules and their effect on customer supplier andor consumer behavior could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering products free of conflict minerals in some circumstances we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary products from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflictfree or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement accordingly these rules could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition 

risks relating to our common stock and financial structure 

future sales of our common stock or other securities may depress our stock price 

we and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock or other equity debt or instruments which constitute an element of our debt and equity collectively securities in the future we may also issue shares of common stock under our equity incentive plan or in connection with future acquisitions we cannot predict the size of future issuances of securities or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock or other securities will have on the price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued in connection with an acquisition the issuance of additional debt securities or the perception that such sales or issuances could occur may cause the price of our common stock to fall 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline additionally the market price for our common stock has been in the past and in the future may be adversely affected by allegations made or reports issued by short sellers analysts or others regarding our business model our management or our financial accounting 

following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often 

been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

delaware law our charter documents and our loan documents may impede or discourage a takeover which could affect the price of our stock 

the antitakeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws our loan documents and delaware law could together or separately impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult our credit agreement provides that a change of control is an event of default our incorporation under delaware law and these provisions could also impede an acquisition takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the price of our common stock 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to react to changes in our business 

as of december 31 2014 we had  19 billion  aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding including  664 million  under our senior secured credit facilities  600 million  aggregate principal amount of 475  senior notes due 2023 4331 million  under our term loan and  95 million  under our accounts receivable securitization program as of december 31 2014 we also had  11 billion  of undrawn availability after giving effect to approximately  60 million  of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facilities and  2 million  of undrawn availability under our accounts receivable securitization program 

our significant amount of debt and our debt service obligations could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations limit our ability to operate our business and impair our competitive position 

for example it could 

 in addition if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the ability to service such debt would increase 

although we are subject to our senior secured credit facilities for so long as they remain in effect the indenture that governs the senior notes does not restrict the future incurrence of unsecured indebtedness guarantees or other obligations the indenture contains certain limitations on our ability to incur liens on assets sell our assets make dividends and distributions and engage in sale and leaseback transactions however these limitations are subject to important exceptions in addition the indenture does not contain many other restrictions including certain restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities including without limitation investments incurring indebtedness or prepaying subordinated indebtedness or engaging in transactions with our affiliates 

our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability among other things to 

 • pay dividends or certain other distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness 

• incur liens on assets 

• make certain investments or other restricted payments 

• engage in transactions with affiliates 

• sell certain assets or merge or consolidate with or into other companies 

• guarantee indebtedness and 

• alter the business we conduct 

as a result of these covenants and restrictions we will be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit agreement a default if not waived could result in acceleration of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing credit facilities or it may be on terms that are not acceptable to us 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due any future refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations additionally the senior secured credit facilities and the indenture that governs our senior notes limit the use of the proceeds from certain dispositions of our assets as a result our senior secured credit facilities and our senior notes may prevent us from using the proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all of our debt service obligations 

in addition we are a holding company and repayment of our indebtedness is dependent upon cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are borrowers or guarantors of the indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries and under certain circumstances distributions from our subsidiaries may be subject to significant taxes that reduce the amount of such distributions available to us in the event that we do not receive sufficient distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our future capital needs may require that we seek to refinance our debt or obtain additional debt or equity financing events 

that could have a negative effect on our business 

we may need to raise additional funds in the future to among other things refinance existing debt fund our existing operations improve or expand our operations respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions from time to time we may raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic alliances or other arrangements funds may not be available or available on terms acceptable to us as a result of different factors including but not limited to turmoil in the credit markets that results in the tightening of credit conditions and current or future regulations applicable to the financial institutions from whom we seek financing if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and further limitations on our operations if we refinance or restructure our debt we may incur charges to write off the unamortized portion of deferred debt issuance costs from a previous financing or we may incur charges related to hedge ineffectiveness from our interest rate swap obligations in addition there are restrictions in the indenture that governs our senior notes on our ability to refinance the notes prior to 2018 if we fail to raise capital when needed our business may be negatively affected 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly and could affect the value of our senior notes 

certain borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and the borrowing under our accounts receivable securitization facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness would correspondingly decrease moreover changes in market interest rates could affect the trading value of our senior notes 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our senior notes 

credit ratings have an important effect on our cost of capital credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include among other items our results of operations business decisions that we make their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading we believe our current credit ratings enhance our ability to borrow funds at favorable rates a downgrade in our current credit rating from a rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facilities a downgrade could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our senior notes preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future or incur other indebtedness upon favorable terms 

  

the right to receive payments on the senior notes is effectively junior to those lenders who have a security interest in our assets 

our obligations under the senior notes and our guarantors’ obligations under their guarantees of the senior notes are unsecured but our and each coborrower’s obligations under our senior secured credit facilities and each guarantor’s obligations under their respective guarantees of the senior secured credit facilities are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our domestic tangible and intangible assets including the stock of most of our whollyowned united states subsidiaries and the stock of certain of our nonunited states subsidiaries if we are declared bankrupt or insolvent or if we default under our senior secured credit facilities the lenders could declare all of the funds borrowed thereunder together with accrued interest immediately due and payable if we were unable to repay such indebtedness the lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets to the exclusion of holders of the senior notes even if an event of default exists under the indenture governing the notes furthermore if the lenders foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any subsidiary guarantor under the senior notes then that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the senior notes automatically and immediately upon such sale in any such event because the senior notes are not secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in subsidiary guarantors it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from which claims by holders of the senior notes could be satisfied or if any assets remained they might be insufficient to satisfy claims fully 

united states federal and state statutes allow courts under specific circumstances to void the senior notes   and the guarantees subordinate claims in respect of the senior notes and the guarantees and require holders of the senior notes to return payments received from us or the guarantors 

our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that are obligors under the senior secured credit facilities also guarantee the 

obligations under the senior notes our issuance of the senior notes and the issuance of the guarantees by the guarantors under the secured credit facilities and the senior notes may be subject to review under state and federal laws if a bankruptcy liquidation or reorganization case or a lawsuit including in circumstances in which bankruptcy is not involved were commenced at some future date by or on behalf of our unpaid creditors or the unpaid creditors of a guarantor under the federal bankruptcy laws and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws a court may avoid or otherwise decline to enforce the senior secured credit facilities the senior notes or a guarantor’s guarantee or may subordinate the senior secured credit facilities the senior notes or such guarantee to our or the applicable guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness while the relevant laws may vary from state to state a court might do so if it found that when indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities was incurred or the senior notes were issued or when the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee or in some states when payments became due under the senior secured credit facilities the senior notes or such guarantee the borrower the issuer or the applicable guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and 

  

 • was engaged in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital or 

• intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature 

a court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the senior secured credit facilities the senior notes or such guarantee if we or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the senior secured credit facilities or the issuance of the senior notes the measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred generally however a borrower an issuer or a guarantor as applicable would be considered insolvent if 

  

 a court might also void the senior secured credit facilities the senior notes or a guarantee without regard to the above factors if the court found that the senior secured credit facilities or the senior notes were incurred or issued or the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee with actual intent to hinder delay or defraud its creditors in addition any payment by us or a guarantor pursuant to the senior secured credit facilities the senior notes or its guarantee could be avoided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors and accordingly the court might direct the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities or the holders of the senior notes to repay any amounts already received from us or such guarantor although each guarantee will contain a “savings clause” intended to limit the subsidiary guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its subsidiary guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer this provision may not be effective to protect any subsidiary guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law furthermore in official committee of unsecured creditors of tousa inc v citicorp north america inc the united states bankruptcy court in the southern district of florida held that a savings clause similar to the savings clause included in the documents relating to our senior secured credit facilities and senior notes was unenforceable as a result the subsidiary guarantees were found to be fraudulent conveyances the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit recently affirmed the liability findings of the bankruptcy court without ruling directly on the enforceability of savings clauses generally if the tousa decision were followed by other courts the risk that the guarantees would be deemed fraudulent conveyances would be significantly increased 

to the extent a court avoids the senior secured credit facilities or the senior notes or any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or holds the senior secured credit facilities or the senior notes or any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities or the holders of the senior notes as the case may be would cease to have any direct claim against us or the applicable guarantor if a court were to take this action our or the applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy our or the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities if any and might not be applied to the payment of the senior secured credit facilities or the senior notes as the case may be sufficient funds to repay the senior secured credit facilities and the senior notes may not be available from other sources including the remaining guarantors if any 

not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our senior secured credit facilities or our senior notes and the assets of our nonguarantor subsidiaries may not be available to make payments on such obligations 

not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the senior secured credit facilities or the senior notes in the event that any nonguarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent liquidates reorganizes dissolves or otherwise winds up holders of its indebtedness and its trade creditors generally will be entitled to payment on their claims from the assets of that subsidiary before any of those assets are made available to the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities or the holders of the senior notes consequently claims in respect of the senior secured credit facilities and the senior notes are structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of our nonguarantor subsidiaries including trade payables and any claims of third party holders of preferred equity interests if any in our nonguarantor subsidiaries for the year ended december 31 2014 our subsidiaries that are not borrowers under or do not guarantee the senior secured credit facilities and our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes represented approximately 33 and 25 of our total revenue and operating income respectively in addition these nonguarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 35 and 36 of our total assets and total liabilities respectively as of december 31 2014 excluding in each case intercompany amounts with respect to both the senior secured credit facilities and the senior notes of these amounts as of the same date our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes and our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior secured credit facilities had approximately 6476 million of outstanding indebtedness which includes 5239 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities by foreign subsidiaries that are borrowers under the revolving credit facilities but that do not guarantee the notes 

we may not be able to repurchase the senior notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer 

upon a change of control as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes the holders of the notes will have the right to require us to offer to purchase all of the notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest such a change of control would also be an event of default under our senior secured credit facilities in order to obtain sufficient funds to pay amounts due under the senior secured credit facilities and the purchase price of the outstanding senior notes we expect that we would have to refinance our indebtedness we cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance our indebtedness on reasonable terms if at all our failure to offer to purchase all outstanding senior notes or to purchase all validly tendered senior notes would be an event of default under the indenture such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other debt our other debt also may contain restrictions on repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture 

the definition of change of control in the indenture governing the senior notes includes a phrase relating to the sale of “all or substantially all” of our assets there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law accordingly the ability of a holder of senior notes to require us to repurchase its notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain 

in addition in certain circumstances as specified in the indenture governing the senior notes we will be required to commence an asset sale offer as defined in the indenture pursuant to which we will be obligated to purchase certain senior notes at a price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest with the proceeds we receive from certain asset sales our other debt may contain restrictions that would limit or prohibit us from completing any such asset sale offer in particular our senior secured credit facilities contain provisions that require us upon the sale of certain assets to apply all of the proceeds from such asset sale to the prepayment of amounts due under the senior secured credit facilities the mandatory prepayment obligations under the senior secured credit facilities will be effectively senior to our obligations to make an asset sale offer with respect to the senior notes under the terms of the indenture our failure to purchase any such senior notes when required under the indenture would be an event of default under the indenture 

  

key terms of the senior notes will be suspended if the notes achieve investment grade ratings and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing 

many of the covenants in the indenture governing the senior notes will be suspended if the notes are rated investment grade by standard  poor’s and moody’s provided at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing including those covenants that restrict among other things our ability to pay dividends incur liens and to enter into certain other transactions there can be no assurance that the senior notes will ever be rated investment grade however suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force although provisions under our other debt like the senior secured credit facilities may continue to restrict us from engaging in these transactions and the effects of any such transactions will be permitted to remain in place even if the senior notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade 

the liquidity and market value of the senior notes may change due to a variety of factors 

the liquidity of any trading market in the senior notes and the market price quoted for the senior notes may be adversely 

affected by changes in the overall market for these types of securities changes in interest rates changes in our ratings and changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industries generally 

we rely on an accounts receivable securitization program for a portion of our liquidity 

we have an arrangement whereby we sell an interest in a portion of our accounts receivable to a special purpose vehicle and receive funding through the commercial paper market this arrangement expires in october 2017 in the event that the market for commercial paper were to close or otherwise become constrained our cost of credit relative to this program could rise or credit could be unavailable altogether

in addition to our acquisition of keystone specialty we made 22  acquisitions during 2014 including 9  wholesale businesses in north america 9  wholesale businesses in europe 2  self service retail operations and 2  specialty vehicle aftermarket businesses our european acquisitions included seven aftermarket parts distribution businesses in the netherlands five  of which were customers of and distributors for our netherlands subsidiary sator in the netherlands we are currently converting our existing distribution model to better align with that of our uk operations this realignment will allow us to sell directly to the end repair shop customer versus through a local wholesale distributor which we expect to improve margins customer service and fulfillment rates and position us well to introduce additional product categories such as collision and specialty vehicle in the long term our other acquisitions completed during the year ended   december 31 2014  enabled us to expand into new product lines and enter new markets 

during the year ended   december 31 2013  we completed 20  acquisitions including our may 2013 acquisition of sator a vehicle mechanical aftermarket parts distribution company based in the netherlands with operations in the netherlands belgium and northern france with the acquisition of sator we expanded our geographic presence in the european vehicle mechanical aftermarket products market into continental europe to complement our existing uk operations 

in addition to our acquisition of sator we acquired 10  wholesale businesses in north america 7  wholesale businesses in europe and 2  self service operations our european acquisitions included five automotive paint distribution businesses in the uk which enabled us to expand our collision product offerings the other acquisitions completed during 2013  enabled us to expand into new product lines and enter new markets 

in august 2013 we entered into an agreement with suncorp group a leading general insurance group in australia and new zealand to develop an alternative vehicle replacement parts business in those countries we are contributing our experience to help establish automotive parts recycling operations and to facilitate the procurement of aftermarket parts while suncorp is supplying salvage vehicles to the venture as well as assisting in establishing relationships with repair shops as customers our investment expanded our geographic presence into australia and new zealand and provides the opportunity to establish a leadership position in the supply of alternative parts in those countries 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we made 30  acquisitions in north america including 22  wholesale businesses and 8  self service retail operations these acquisitions enabled us to expand our geographic presence and to enter new markets additionally two of our acquisitions were completed with a goal of improving the recovery from scrap and other metals harvested from the vehicles we purchase a precious metals refining and reclamation business and a scrap metal shredder 

sources of revenue 

we report our revenue in two categories i parts and services and ii other our parts and services revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products and related services including i aftermarket other new and refurbished products and ii recycled remanufactured and related products and services for the year ended   december 31 2014  parts and services revenue represented approximately 90  of our consolidated revenue 

the majority of our parts and services revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle replacement products to collision and mechanical repair shops our vehicle replacement products include sheet metal crash parts such as doors hoods and fenders bumper covers engines head and tail lamps and wheels the demand for these products is influenced by several factors including the number of vehicles in operation the number of miles being driven the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents the age profile of vehicles in accidents the availability and pricing of new oem parts seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions additionally automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process accordingly we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our vehicle replacement products while they are not our direct customers we do provide insurance carriers services in an effort to promote the increased usage of alternative replacement products in the repair process such services include the review of vehicle repair order estimates direct quotation services to insurance company adjusters and an aftermarket parts quality and service assurance program we neither charge a fee to the insurance carriers for these services nor adjust our pricing of products for our customers when we perform these services for insurance carriers there is no standard price for many of our vehicle replacement products but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as product availability quality demand new oem product prices the age and mileage of the vehicle from which the part was obtained competitor pricing and our product cost 

with our january 3 2014 acquisition of keystone specialty our revenue from aftermarket other new and refurbished products also includes revenue generated from the sale of specialty aftermarket vehicle equipment and accessories these products are primarily sold to a large customer base of specialty vehicle retailers and equipment installers including mostly independent singlesite operators specialty vehicle aftermarket products are typically installed on vehicles within the first year of ownership to enhance functionality performance or aesthetics as a result the demand for these products is influenced by new and used vehicle sales and the overall economic health of vehicle owners which may be affected by general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending the prices for our specialty vehicle products are based on manufacturers suggested retail prices with discounts applied based on prevailing market conditions customer volumes and promotions that we may offer from time to time 

for the year ended   december 31 2014  revenue from other sources represented approximately 10  of our consolidated sales these other sources include scrap sales and sales of aluminum ingots and sows we derive scrap metal from several sources including vehicles that have been used in both our wholesale and self service recycling operations and from oems and other entities that contract with us for secure disposal of crush only vehicles other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold 

cost of goods sold 

our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts freight and overhead costs related to the purchasing warehousing and distribution of our inventory including labor facility and equipment costs and depreciation our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors our cost of goods sold for refurbished products includes the price we pay for cores freight and costs to refurbish the parts including direct and indirect labor facility and equipment costs depreciation and other overhead related to our refurbishing operations 

our cost of goods sold for recycled products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and where applicable auction towing and storage fees prices for salvage vehicles may be impacted by a variety of factors including the number of buyers competing to purchase the vehicles the demand and pricing trends for used vehicles the number of vehicles designated as “total losses” by insurance companies the production level of new vehicles which provides the source from which salvage vehicles ultimately come the age of vehicles at auction and the status of laws regulating bidders or exporters of salvage vehicles from time to time we may also adjust our buying strategy to target vehicles with different attributes for example age level of damage revenue potential due to changes relating to these factors we have seen the prices we pay for salvage vehicles fluctuate over time our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles our labor and laborrelated costs related to acquisition and dismantling generally account for between 8 and 10 of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle the acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and as a result energy costs are not material our cost of goods sold for remanufactured products includes the price we pay for cores freight and costs to remanufacture the products including direct and indirect labor facility and equipment costs depreciation and other overhead related to our remanufacturing operations 

some of our salvage mechanical products are sold with a standard sixmonth warranty against defects additionally some of our remanufactured engines are sold with a standard threeyear warranty against defects we also provide a limited lifetime warranty for certain of our aftermarket products that is supported by certain of the suppliers of those products we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claims information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses 

 other revenue is primarily generated from the hulks and unusable parts of the vehicles we acquire for our wholesale and self service recycled product operations and therefore the costs of these sales include the proportionate share of the price we pay for the salvage vehicles as well as the applicable auction storage and towing fees and internal costs to purchase and dismantle the vehicles our cost of goods sold for other revenue will fluctuate based on the prices paid for salvage vehicles which may be impacted by a variety of factors as discussed above 

expenses 

our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our aftermarket selling warehouses salvage yards and self service retail facilities these costs include personnel expenses such as wages incentive compensation and employee benefits for plant management and facility and warehouse personnel as well as rent for our facilities and related utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance the costs included in facility and warehouse expenses do not relate to inventory processing or conversion activities and as such are classified below the gross margin line on our consolidated statements of income 

our distribution expenses primarily include our costs to prepare and deliver our products to our customers included in our distribution expense category are personnel costs such as wages employee benefits and incentive compensation for drivers third party freight costs fuel and expenses related to our delivery and transfer trucks including vehicle leases repairs and maintenance and insurance 

our selling and marketing expenses primarily include salary commission and other incentive compensation expenses for sales personnel advertising promotion and marketing costs credit card fees telephone and other communication expenses and bad debt expense personnel costs generally account for between 75 and 80 of our selling and marketing expenses most of our sales personnel are paid on a commission basis the number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our customers’ needs and increase our sales volume our objective is to continually evaluate our sales force develop and implement training programs and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness 

our general and administrative expenses primarily include the costs of our corporate offices and field support center which provide management treasury accounting legal payroll business development human resources and information systems functions general and administrative expenses include wages benefits stockbased compensation and other incentive compensation for corporate regional and administrative personnel information systems support and maintenance expenses and accounting legal and other professional fees 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related accidents which generate repairs we expect our specialty vehicle operations to generate greater revenue and earnings in the first half of the year when vehicle owners tend to install specialty products 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition inventory valuation business combinations and goodwill impairment we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue actual results may differ from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize and report revenue from the sale of vehicle products when they are shipped to or picked up by the customers and title has transferred subject to an allowance for estimated returns discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information a product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment our customers may earn discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment we analyze historical returns and allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates we use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold if actual returns and allowances are higher than our historical experience there would be an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence 

we recognize revenue from the sale of scrap metal other metals and cores when title has transferred which typically occurs upon delivery to the customer 

inventory accounting 

aftermarket and refurbished product inventory  our aftermarket inventory cost is established based on the average price we pay for parts and includes expenses incurred for freight and overhead costs for items purchased from foreign companies import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included refurbished inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for cores and also includes expenses incurred for freight labor and other overhead related to our refurbishing operations 

salvage and remanufactured inventory  our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle including auction towing and storage fees as well as expenditures for buying and dismantling vehicles inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facilitys inventory at expected selling prices the assessment of which incorporates the sales probability based on a parts days in stock and historical demand the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facilitys historical profitability for salvage vehicles remanufactured inventory cost is based upon the price paid for cores and also includes expenses incurred for freight direct manufacturing costs and overhead related to our remanufacturing operations 

all inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market the carrying value of our inventory includes a provision for excess and obsolete inventory which we calculate based on a detailed review of current inventory on hand historical sales experience and anticipated demand the carrying value is adjusted downward when anticipated demand is less than inventory on hand inventories have become obsolete or inventory costs are in excess of net realizable value 

business combinations 

we record our acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values we utilize management estimates and in some instances independent thirdparty valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and contingent consideration granted such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions including projections of future events and operating performance the purchase price allocation is subject to change during the measurement period which is limited to one year subsequent to the acquisition date 

goodwill impairment 

we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually when testing goodwill for impairment we are required to evaluate events and circumstances that may affect the performance of the reporting unit and the extent to which the events and circumstances may impact the future cash flows of the reporting unit to determine whether the fair value of the assets exceed the carrying value if these assumptions or estimates change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill 

we are organized into four  operating segments wholesalenorth america wholesaleeurope self service and specialty we have also concluded that these four  operating segments are reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing in 2014  we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist during 2014  we did not identify any events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts therefore we did not perform any impairment tests other than our annual test in the fourth quarter of 2014  

our goodwill would be considered impaired if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value the fair value estimates are established using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach we believe that using two methods to determine fair value limits the chances of an unrepresentative valuation as of december 31 2014  we had a total of 23 billion  in goodwill subject to future impairment tests if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results we determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2014  a 10 decrease in the fair value estimates of the reporting units in the annual impairment test would not have changed this determination

results of operations—consolidated 

the following table sets forth statements of income data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated 



year ended december 31 2014  compared to year ended december 31 2013   

revenue  the following table summarizes the changes in revenue by category in thousands 



refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to revenue growth during 2014  compared to the prior year 

cost of goods sold  our cost of goods sold increased to 607  of revenue in 2014  from 590  of revenue in 2013  the increase in cost of goods sold was primarily the result of lower margins generated by certain of our acquired businesses which increased cost of goods sold by 20 of revenue our keystone specialty business operates a three step distribution model which generates lower gross margins compared to our revenue from sales directly to repairers and therefore was responsible for 12 of the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue our other acquisitions completed since the beginning of the prior year were responsible for the remainder of the acquisition impact on cost of goods sold none of which had a material impact on our gross margins individually partially offsetting the impact of our acquisitions improvement in our north american gross margins decreased cost of goods sold by 04 of revenue refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in cost of goods sold by segment for the year ended   december 31 2014  compared to the year ended   december 31 2013  

facility and warehouse expenses  as a percentage of revenue facility and warehouse expenses for the year ended   december 31 2014  decreased to 78  from 84  in the prior year which was primarily due to the effect of our keystone specialty acquisition compared to our other north american operations keystone specialty stores a greater portion of inventory at its regional distribution centers the costs of which are capitalized into inventory and expensed through cost of goods sold in our north american wholesale operations most of the inventory sold by our locations is stored on site rather than in distribution centers and the related facility and warehouse expenses are recorded in this line item 

distribution expenses  as a percentage of revenue distribution expenses increased to 86  in 2014  from 85  in 2013  primarily due to greater costs in our european segment in our uk operations we incurred greater personnel expenditures as a result of 59 new branch openings since the beginning of the prior year which increased distribution expenses by 01 of revenue 

selling general and administrative expenses  our selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended   december 31 2014  decreased to 113  of revenue from 118  of revenue in the prior year our acquisitions contributed 04 of the reduction in expense including primarily the effect of keystone specialty which has lower selling general and administrative costs compared to our other operations greater leverage of our sales force and general and administrative personnel in our north american operations contributed an additional 03 improvement in costs as a percentage of revenue these reductions in expense as a percentage of revenue were partially offset by greater expenses in our european operations including greater expenditures for our sales force primarily related to new branch openings and higher advertising costs compared to the prior year period which increased selling general and administrative expenses by 02 of revenue

year ended december 31 2013  compared to year ended december 31 2012   

revenue  the following table summarizes the changes in revenue by category amounts in thousands 



refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to revenue growth during 2013 compared to the prior year 

cost of goods sold  our cost of goods sold increased to 590 of revenue in 2013 from 582 of revenue in 2012 in 2013 our cost of goods sold reflected a 07 increase as a percentage of revenue as a result of the lower gross margins generated by certain of our acquisitions including our 2013 acquisitions of sator and five ukbased paint distribution businesses as well as our june 2012 acquisition of a precious metals refining and reclamation business in 2012 we recognized a gain on lawsuit settlements totaling 179 million that did not reoccur in 2013 thus accounting for 04 of the increase in the 2013 cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue see note 7 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the lawsuit settlements these increases in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue were partially offset by 04 improvement in gross margin in our salvage operations within our wholesale  north america segment which reflects the impact of various individually insignificant factors the largest of which were lower vehicle costs and pricing improvements 

facility and warehouse expenses  as a percentage of revenue facility and warehouse expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 remained flat at 84 of revenue our north american operations increased facility and warehouse expense by 02 of revenue which reflects increased weighting of our self service business during 2012 we completed the acquisition of eight self service retail operations which generally incur greater facility costs as a percentage of revenue compared to our wholesale operations as our self service business tends to require a larger facility footprint to generate its sales higher costs in north america were offset by a greater proportion of revenue generated by our european operations which incur lower facility and warehouse costs as a percentage of revenue combined with improved leveraging of facility and warehouse personnel in our uk operations related to 56 new branch openings completed since the beginning of 2012 

distribution expenses  as a percentage of revenue distribution expenses decreased to 85 of revenue in 2013 from 91 of revenue in 2012 in our north american operations improved leveraging of our distribution workforce contributed 02 of the reduction in distribution expenses as a percentage of revenue fuel expense also decreased by 01 of revenue due to a reduction in the average price we pay for fuel our european operations contributed the remainder of the decrease including a 02 benefit from our 2013 european acquisitions as well as a 01 benefit from our existing uk operations primarily as a result of improved leverage related to 56 new branch openings since the beginning of 2012 

selling general and administrative expenses  our selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 decreased to 118 of revenue from 120 during the prior year the reduction of these expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects an approximately equal impact from improved leveraging of general and administrative overhead costs and the relatively lower general and administrative expenses incurred by our sator business compared to our other operations 

restructuring and acquisition related expenses  the following table summarizes restructuring and acquisition related expenses for the periods indicated in thousands

 provision for income taxes  our effective income tax rate was 345 and 362 for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively we continued to expand our international operations throughout 2012 and 2013 with both acquisition related and organic revenue growth in our european segment as well as through acquisitions in canada the lower effective income tax rate in 2013 reflects a 14 benefit relative to the prior year as a result of this growth in our international operations where a larger proportion of our pretax income was generated in lower rate jurisdictions the effect of lower state income taxes other discrete items and permanent differences contributed the remaining 03 reduction in the effective tax rate compared to the prior year 

results of operations—segment reporting 

we have four operating segments wholesale – north america wholesale – europe self service and specialty our specialty operating segment was formed with our january 3 2014 acquisition of keystone specialty as discussed in note 8 business combinations  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k our wholesale – north america and self service operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment north america because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services customers and methods of distribution therefore we present three reportable segments north america europe and specialty 

the following table presents our financial performance including third party revenue total revenue and segment ebitda by reportable segment for the periods indicated in thousands 

  



the key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker who is our chief executive officer is segment ebitda segment ebitda includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment corporate and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage with shared expenses apportioned based on the segments percentage of consolidated revenue segment ebitda is calculated as ebitda excluding restructuring and acquisition related expenses change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries ebitda which is the basis for segment ebitda is calculated as net income excluding depreciation amortization interest including loss on debt extinguishment and taxes loss on debt extinguishment is considered a component of interest in calculating ebitda as the writeoff of debt issuance costs is similar to the treatment of debt issuance cost amortization see note 13 segment and geographic information  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a reconciliation of total segment ebitda to net income 

because our specialty segment was formed on january 3 2014 with our keystone specialty acquisition the discussion of our consolidated results of operations covers the factors driving the yearoveryear performance of our existing business and also discusses the effect of the specialty operations on our consolidated results results for the specialty segment will not have a comparative period until the first quarter of 2015 however compared to keystone specialtys unaudited results for the year ended   december 31 2013  revenue in our specialty segment increased 158 during the fourth quarter of 2014 we completed two additional acquisitions in our specialty segment which contributed approximately one quarter of the revenue growth the remaining revenue growth was primarily due to greater sales volumes as a result of favorable economic conditions additionally during the year ended   december 31 2014  we generated a greater proportion of revenue from our higherend specialty vehicle products such as truck and recreational vehicle accessories which resulted in a favorable mix of revenue compared to the prior year unaudited results 

year ended december 31 2014  compared to year ended december 31 2013   

north america 

third party revenue  the following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our north american segment in thousands 



 segment ebitda  as a percentage of total revenue segment ebitda in north america increased to 133  during the year ended   december 31 2014  from 128  in the prior year the improvement in segment ebitda reflects an increase in gross margin by 02 of revenue combined with a 03 reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue our wholesale operations increased gross margin by 06 of revenue including a 05 improvement from lower inventory purchase costs and a favorable mix effect of 02 as a result of generating less revenue from our lower margin sales of scrap and precious metals the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was partially offset by the impact of our acquisition of an automotive core business in january 2014 which increased our revenue in product lines that are complementary to our existing vehicle replacement parts offerings but generate lower gross margins thereby decreasing gross margins by 05 of revenue selling general and administrative expenses declined by 05 of revenue primarily due to improved leverage of our sales force and general and administrative personnel but this was partially offset by an increase of facility and warehouse expenses by 02 of revenue due to higher personnel expenditures 

europe 

third party revenue  the following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our european segment in thousands 



 segment ebitda  as a percentage of total revenue segment ebitda in our european operations decreased to 91  for the year ended   december 31 2014  from 113  during the year ended   december 31 2013  our acquisitions completed since the beginning of the prior year were responsible for 11 of the decline in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue including primarily the effect of the netherlands distributors we acquired in may 2014 the effect of the netherlands distributors includes a negative gross margin impact of 03 that we believe will not affect future periods once the higher cost acquired inventory has turned and we are able to internalize the incremental distributor margin additionally as we transition our continental european operations to a two step distribution model including the effect of these acquisitions we expect our operating expenses to increase as we internalize the cost of the distribution network during the year ended   december 31 2014  these greater operating costs resulted in a decline in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue thereby accounting for the remaining negative impact on segment ebitda margins our existing operations were responsible for the remaining decline in segment ebitda including a 07 effect from 59 new branch openings in the uk since the beginning of the prior year in our uk operations additionally we incurred 02 in higher advertising expenses compared to the prior year

third party revenue  the following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our north american segment in thousands 



 47 

 segment ebitda  as a percentage of total revenue segment ebitda decreased to 128  in 2013 from 129 in 2012 in 2012 we recognized a gain on lawsuit settlements totaling 179 million which decreased 2013 segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue by 05 relative to 2012 as the gain did not reoccur in 2013 our precious metals refining and reclamation business which generates lower margins as a percentage of revenue contributed 02 of the decline in segment ebitda primarily due to including a full year of results in 2013 compared to only seven months in 2012 in our self service operations a narrowing spread between the prices received for scrap and other metals and the cost of the scrap component of the cars that we crushed resulted in a decrease in segment ebitda of 02 of revenue these decreases were partly offset by a 05 improvement in segment ebitda margin from our wholesale salvage operations which reflects the impact of various individually insignificant factors the largest of which were lower vehicle costs and pricing improvements lower operating expenses increased segment ebitda by 02 of revenue as a result of improved leverage of our distribution workforce and lower fuel costs partially offset by higher facility costs in our self service operations 

europe 

third party revenue  the following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our european segment in thousands 



 segment ebitda  as a percentage of total revenue segment ebitda in our european segment increased to 113  for the year ended december 31 2013 from 106  during 2012 in our uk operations improved leverage of our facilities and distribution network to support new branch openings and existing store sales growth resulted in a 11 improvement in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior year the improvement in segment ebitda margin in our uk operations was partially offset by the impact of our sator acquisition which decreased segment ebitda by 04 as a percentage of revenue 

2015 outlook 

we estimate that net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ending december 31 2015 excluding the impact of any restructuring and acquisition related expenses and any gains or losses related to acquisitions or divestitures including changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities will be in the range of 420 million to 450 million and 136 to 146 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes liquidity data as of the dates indicated in thousands 



1  includes our revolving credit facilities and our receivables securitization facility 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through both internal development and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our credit facilities we utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures with the excess amounts going towards funding acquisitions or paying down outstanding debt as we have pursued acquisitions as part of our growth strategy our cash flows from operations have not always been sufficient to cover our investing activities to fund our acquisitions we have accessed various forms of debt financing including our march 2014 amendment to our senior secured credit facilities and the issuance of 600 million of senior notes in may 2013 

as of december 31 2014  we had debt outstanding and additional available sources of financing as follows 

   

since the first quarter of 2013 we have undertaken several financing transactions to increase our available liquidity including two amendments to our senior secured credit facilities most recently amended as of march 27 2014 our 600 million senior notes offering completed in may 2013 and an amendment to our receivables facility in september 2014 the amendments to our credit facilities increased the size of our revolver reset the term loan extended the maturity of the credit agreement and adjusted certain of our bank covenants by issuing the notes we diversified our financing structure by adding a longterm fixed rate instrument and reducing our reliance on the bank market we also believe the interest rate on the notes was favorable although higher than todays shortterm floating rate debt the 10year fixed rate of 475 reduces our risk of future interest rate increases which we have seen in the market subsequent to our offering the amendment to our receivables facility increased our maximum borrowing capacity by 17 million and extended the maturity by two years the new structure provides financial flexibility to execute our longterm growth strategy if we see an attractive acquisition opportunity we have the ability to use our revolver to move quickly and have certainty of funding up to the amount of our thenavailable liquidity 

 as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 11 billion available under our credit facilities combined with approximately 115 million of cash and equivalents at december 31 2014  we had approximately 12 billion in available liquidity a decrease of 59 million over our available liquidity as of december 31 2013 the amendment to our senior secured credit facilities in the first quarter of 2014 provided an additional 500 million of availability on our revolver which more than offset the increase in borrowings to finance our january 2014 keystone specialty acquisition we believe that our current liquidity and cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements although such sources may not be sufficient for future acquisitions depending on their size while we believe that we currently have adequate capacity from time to time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements there can be no assurance that additional funding or refinancing of our credit facilities if needed will be available on terms attractive to us or at all furthermore any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants or higher interest costs our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at variable rates which depend on the currency and the duration of the borrowing plus an applicable margin rate which is subject to change quarterly based on our reported leverage ratio we 

hold interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates on our credit agreement borrowings as described in note 5 derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k with the effect of fixing the interest rates on the respective notional amounts after giving effect to these interest rate swap contracts the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2014  was 210  although the rate will increase in march 2015 as a result of the quarterly reset of our applicable margin rate including the borrowings on our senior notes and receivables securitization program our overall weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 292  at december 31 2014  cash interest payments were 597 million  for the year ended   december 31 2014  including interest payments totaling 285 million related to the senior notes the semiannual interest payments on our senior notes are made in may and november each year and began in november 2013 we had outstanding credit agreement borrowings of 11 billion  and 6726 million  at december 31 2014  and december 31 2013 respectively of these amounts 225 million were classified as current maturities at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 we have scheduled repayments of 56 million each quarter on the term loan through its maturity in may 2019 but no other significant principal payments on our credit facilities prior to the maturity of the receivables securitization program in october 2017 in addition to the repayments under our credit facilities we will make payments on notes payable and other debt totaling 41 million in the next 12 months the majority of which is for payments on notes payable issued in connection with acquisitions 

our credit agreement contains customary covenants that provide limitations and conditions on our ability to enter into certain transactions the credit agreement also contains financial and affirmative covenants including limitations on our net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our credit agreement as of december 31 2014  

as of december 31 2014 cash held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled 77 million and undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately 266 million  these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no provision for us income taxes has been provided thereon should these earnings be repatriated in the future in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to both us income taxes subject to adjustment for foreign tax credits and potential withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries we believe that we have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our financial obligations in the us without resort to repatriation of foreign earnings 

the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds we normally pay for aftermarket product purchases at the time of shipment or on standard payment terms depending on the manufacturer and the negotiated payment terms we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles 

the following table sets forth a summary of our inventory procurement for 2014  2013  and 2012  



aftermarket inventory purchases in 2014 included 613 million within our specialty segment that was formed in 2014 as well as 882 million of incremental purchases for our sator business acquired in may 2013 from the beginning of 2014 through the anniversary date of the acquisition 

net cash provided by operating activities  totaled 3709 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 4281 million  in 2013  compared to the prior year our 2014 ebitda increased by 1596 million  due to both acquisition related growth and organic growth cash outflows for our primary working capital accounts receivables inventory and payables increased to 1898 million during 2014 from 643 million during 2013 as a result of greater inventory growth particularly in our aftermarket products as well as increased receivables balances including the effect of increased sales levels in our uk operations cash flows related to our primary working capital accounts can be volatile as the purchases payments and collections can be timed differently from period to period and can be influenced by factors outside of our control however we expect that the net change in these working capital items will generally be a cash outflow as we grow our business each year cash paid for income taxes increased to 1770 million from 1109 million due to the overpayment of taxes in 2012 that we offset against the estimated tax payments in 2013 as well as greater earnings that required higher estimated tax payments in 2014 compared to the prior year during 2014 we made two semiannual interest payments totaling 285 million on our senior notes whereas in 2013 we made one semiannual interest payment of 142 million cash payments for bonuses were 78 million higher during 2014 than they were in 2013

net cash used in investing activities totaled 5056 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 3525 million for the same period of 2012 we invested 4084 million of cash net of cash acquired in business acquisitions during 2013 including our acquisition of sator for 2728 million compared to 2653 million for business acquisitions in the comparable prior year in the third quarter of 2013 we entered into an agreement with suncorp group to develop an alternative vehicle products business in australia and new zealand for which our initial investment totaled 91 million property and equipment purchases were 902 million in the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 883 million in the prior year

we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of distribution centers processing and sales facilities and warehouses through further integration of our facilities and through selected business acquisitions our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions 

2015 outlook 

we estimate that our capital expenditures for 2015 excluding business acquisitions will be between 150 million and 180 million we expect to use these funds for several major facility expansions improvement of current facilities real estate acquisitions and systems development projects we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 will be approximately 425 million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facilities where interest rates are tied to the prime rate libor or cdor therefore we implemented a policy to manage our exposure to variable interest rates on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt instruments through the use of interest rate swap contracts these contracts convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt matching the currency effective dates and maturity dates to specific debt instruments net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swap contracts are included as adjustments to interest expense all of our interest rate swap contracts have been executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy wells fargo bank na bank of america na and rbs citizens na 

as of december 31 2014  we held six interest rate swap contracts representing a total of 420 million of us dollardenominated notional amount debt £50 million of pound sterlingdenominated notional amount debt and cad 25 million of canadian dollardenominated notional amount debt our interest rate swap contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and modify the variable rate nature of that portion of our variable rate debt these swaps have maturity dates ranging from october 2015 through december 2016 in total we had 47 of our variable rate debt under our credit facilities at fixed rates at december 31 2014  compared to 78 at december 31 2013 which reflects the increase in borrowings during 2014 to finance our acquisitions as of december 31 2014  the fair market value of these swap contracts was a net liability of 52 million  the values of such contracts are subject to changes in interest rates 

at december 31 2014  we had 673 million of variable rate debt that was not hedged using sensitivity analysis a 100 basis point movement in interest rates would change interest expense by 67 million over the next twelve months 

the proceeds of our may 2013 senior notes offering were used to finance our eurodenominated acquisition of sator as well as to repay a portion of our pound sterlingdenominated revolver borrowings held by our european operations in connection with these transactions in 2013 we entered into eurodenominated and pound sterlingdenominated intercompany notes which incurred transaction gains and losses from fluctuations in the us dollar against these currencies to mitigate these fluctuations we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to sell €1500 million for 1950 million and £700 million for 1058 million the gains or losses from the remeasurement of these contracts are recorded to earnings to offset the remeasurement of the related notes during the year ended december 31 2014  we settled these forward contracts through payments to the counterparties totaling 200 million while there are no such forward contracts outstanding as of december 31 2014 we may enter into additional foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on similar intercompany financing transactions 

additionally we are exposed to currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket products from foreign countries the majority of our foreign inventory purchases are from manufacturers based in taiwan while our transactions with manufacturers based in taiwan are conducted in us dollars changes in the relationship between the us dollar and the taiwan dollar might impact the purchase price of aftermarket products our aftermarket operations in canada which also purchase inventory from taiwan in us dollars are further subject to changes in the relationship between the us dollar and the canadian dollar our aftermarket operations in the uk also source a portion of their inventory from taiwan as well as from other european countries and china resulting in exposure to changes in the relationship of the pound sterling against the euro and the us dollar we hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations for certain of our purchases in our european operations but the notional amount and fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2014  were immaterial we do not currently attempt to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in our north american operations and we may not be able to pass on any price increases to our customers 

foreign currency fluctuations may also impact the financial results we report for the portions of our business that operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar our operations in europe and other countries represented 332 and 30 of our revenue during 2014 and 2013 respectively an increase or decrease in the strength of the us dollar against these currencies by 10 would result in a 3  change in our consolidated revenue and our operating income for the year ended december 31 2014  

other than with respect to our intercompany transactions denominated in euro and pound sterling and a portion of our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in the uk we do not hold derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency risk our net investment in foreign operations is partially hedged by the foreign currency denominated borrowings we use to fund foreign acquisitions additionally we have elected not to hedge the foreign currency risk related to the interest payments on these borrowings as we generate canadian dollar pound sterling and euro cash flows that can be used to fund debt payments as of december 31 2014  we had amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities of €2165 million £962 million and cad 1304 million as of december 31 2013 we had amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities of €70 million £729 million and cad 1100 million since december 31 2013 we have replaced certain of our 

us dollar denominated borrowings with foreigncurrency denominated borrowings primarily in europe which more closely aligns the functional currency of our borrowings and the cash flows used to fund debt payments 

we are also exposed to market risk related to price fluctuations in scrap metal and other metals market prices of these metals affect the amount that we pay for our inventory as well as the revenue that we generate from sales of these metals as both our revenue and costs are affected by the price fluctuations we have a natural hedge against the changes however there is typically a lag between the effect on our revenue from metal price fluctuations and inventory cost changes therefore we can experience positive or negative gross margin effects in periods of rising or falling metals prices particularly when such prices move rapidly if market prices were to fall at a greater rate than our vehicle acquisition costs we could experience a decline in gross margin scrap metal and other metal prices declined 15 sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2014 which had a negative effect on our revenue and margins this trend will continue until inventory costs decrease by an amount commensurate with the decline of scrap metal and other metal prices as of december 31 2014  we held shortterm metals forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in metals prices specifically related to our precious metals refining and reclamation business the notional amount and fair value of these forward contracts at december 31 2014  were immaterial

 item 1 business 

overview 

lkq corporation lkq or the company provides replacement parts components and systems needed to repair cars and trucks buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers oems new products produced by companies other than the oems which are sometimes referred to as aftermarket products recycled products obtained from salvage vehicles used products that have been refurbished and used products that have been remanufactured 

we distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops including aftermarket collision and mechanical products recycled collision and mechanical products refurbished collision products such as wheels bumper covers and lights and remanufactured engines collectively we refer to these products as alternative parts because they are not new oem products we are the nation’s largest provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and a leading provider of alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products with our sales processing and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the united states our wholesale operations also reach most major markets in canada we are a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement products in the united kingdom and in the second quarter of 2013 we expanded our operations into continental europe through the acquisition of sator beheer bv sator a leading distributor of vehicle mechanical aftermarket products in the benelux region in addition to our wholesale operations we operate self service retail facilities across the us that sell recycled automotive products we have organized our businesses into three operating segments wholesale – north america wholesale – europe and self service we aggregate our north american operating segments wholesale – north america and self service into one reportable segment resulting in two reportable segments north america and europe see note 13 segment and geographic information  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for financial information by reportable segment and by geographic region 

the majority of our products and services are sold to collision repair shops also known as body shops and mechanical repair shops we also generate a portion of our revenue from scrap sales to metal recyclers additionally we indirectly rely on insurance companies which ultimately pay for the majority of collision repairs of insured vehicles to help drive demand insurance companies tend to exert significant influence in the vehicle repair decision because of their importance to the process we have formed relationships with certain insurance companies in north america for which we are designated a preferred products supplier we are in the process of establishing similar relationships with insurance companies in europe 

we obtain the majority of our aftermarket inventory from automotive parts manufacturers and distributors primarily based in the us the uk and other european countries taiwan and china we procure recycled automotive products mainly by purchasing salvage vehicles typically severely damaged by collisions and primarily sold at salvage auctions or pools and then dismantling and inventorying the parts the refurbished and remanufactured products that we sell such as wheels bumper covers lights and engines originate from the salvage vehicles bought at auctions and from parts received in trade from customers purchasing replacement products from us 

we believe that we provide customers and indirectly insurance companies with a value proposition that includes high quality products at a lower cost than new oem products extensive product availability due to our expansive distribution network responsive service and quick delivery the breadth of our alternative parts offerings allows us to serve as a onestop solution for our customers looking for the most cost effective way to provide quality repairs 

we strive to be environmentally responsible our recycled automotive products provide an alternative to the manufacture of new products which would require the expenditure of more resources and energy and would generate additional pollution in addition we save landfill space because the parts that we recycle would otherwise be discarded we also collect materials such as metals plastics fuel and motor oil from the salvage vehicles that we procure and use them in our operations or sell them to other users 

history 

since our formation in 1998 we have grown through internal development and over 170 acquisitions today lkq is the only supplier of alternative parts for the automotive collision and mechanical repair industry with a network and presence serving most major markets in the us and canada we are also a leading supplier of automotive aftermarket products in the uk and the netherlands 

initially formed through the combination of a number of wholesale recycled products businesses located in florida michigan ohio and wisconsin lkq grew to be a leading source for recycled automotive collision and mechanical products we subsequently expanded through acquisitions of aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured product suppliers and manufacturers and also expanded into the self service retail business we expanded our aftermarket automotive products through our 2007 acquisition of keystone automotive industries inc which at the time of acquisition was the leading 

domestic distributor of aftermarket products including collision replacement products paint products refurbished steel bumpers bumper covers and alloy wheels 

in october 2011 we expanded our operations into the european automotive aftermarket business through our acquisition of euro car parts holdings limited ecp we further expanded our geographic presence into continental europe in may 2013 through our acquisition of sator a vehicle mechanical aftermarket parts distribution company based in the netherlands with operations in the netherlands belgium and northern france our european product offerings are primarily focused on vehicle aftermarket mechanical products many of which are sourced from the same suppliers that provide products to the oems the expansion of our geographic presence beyond north america into the european market offers an opportunity to us as that market has historically had a low penetration of alternative collision parts 

in addition to our acquisition of sator we made 19  acquisitions during 2013 including 10  wholesale businesses in north america 7  wholesale businesses in our european segment and 2  self service operations our european acquisitions included five automotive paint distribution businesses in the uk which enabled us to expand our collision product offerings our other acquisitions completed during 2013 enabled us to expand into new product lines and enter new markets 

in august 2013 we entered into an agreement with suncorp group a leading general insurance group in australia and new zealand to develop an alternative vehicle replacement parts business in those countries under the terms of the agreement we will contribute our experience to help establish automotive parts recycling operations and to facilitate the procurement of aftermarket parts while suncorp will supply salvage vehicles to the venture as well as assist in establishing relationships with repair shops as customers our investment will expand our geographic presence into australia and new zealand and will provide the opportunity to establish a leadership position in the supply of alternative parts in those countries 

on january 3 2014 we completed our acquisition of keystone automotive holdings inc “keystone specialty” keystone specialty is a leading distributor and marketer of specialty aftermarket equipment and accessories in north america serving the following six product segments truck and offroad speed and performance recreational vehicle towing wheels tires and performance handling and miscellaneous accessories our acquisition of keystone specialty allows us to enter into new product lines and increase the size of our addressable market in addition we believe that the acquisition creates potential logistics and administrative cost synergies and crossselling opportunities 

also in january 2014 we completed the acquisition of a us based distributor of automotive cores as well as new and remanufactured mechanical automotive replacement parts we believe this acquisition will expand our core and remanufactured product mix and will allow us to expand our product offering to include certain parts also purchased by oems in february 2014 we acquired a wholesale salvage operation and a self service operation in north america which we believe will expand our market share in the respective markets 

strategy 

we are focused on creating economic value for our stockholders by enhancing our position as a leading source for alternative collision and mechanical repair products and by expanding into other product lines and businesses that may benefit from our operating strengths we believe a supply network with a broad inventory of quality alternative collision and mechanical repair and other products high fulfillment rates and superior customer service provides us with a competitive advantage 

other than oems the competition in the markets that we serve is extremely fragmented and the supply of products tends to be localized often leading to low fulfillment rates particularly with recycled products in north america the distribution channels for aftermarket and refurbished products have historically been distinct and separate from those for recycled and remanufactured products despite serving the same customer segment we provide value to our customers by bringing these two channels together to provide a broader product offering and more efficient distribution process 

to execute our strategy in north america we are expanding our network of parts warehouses and dismantling plants in major metropolitan areas and employing a distribution system that allows for order fulfillment from regional warehouses located across the us and canada by increasing local inventory levels and expanding our network to provide timely access to a greater range of parts we have increased fulfillment rates beyond the levels that we believe most of our competitors realize particularly for recycled products 

sources of high quality reliable alternatives to oem products are important to insurance companies and to our direct customers as they seek to control repair costs lower parts costs and quicker completion of orders save money and reduce cycle times in order to execute this strategy and build on our progress thus far we will continue to seek to expand into new markets and to improve penetration both organically and through acquisitions in targeted markets 

extensive inplace network 

we have invested significant capital to develop a network of alternative parts facilities across north america we believe our extensive network gives us a distinct ability to benefit the major automobile insurance companies which are generally operated on a national or regional level the use of our products lowers the cost of repairs decreases the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and provides a replacement product that is of high quality and comparable performance to the part replaced all of which are favorable to insurance companies additionally the difficulty and time required to obtain proper zoning as well as dismantling and other environmental permits necessary to operate newlysited recycled facilities would make establishing a new network of recycled locations a challenge for a competitor in addition there are difficulties associated with recruiting and hiring an experienced management team that has strong industry knowledge 

we are attempting to utilize a similar strategy in europe with our acquisitions of ecp and sator in the past three years these companies have a national presence in their respective countries and we are working to integrate the operations to take advantage of shared procurement warehousing and product offerings 

strong business relationships 

we have developed business relationships with key constituents including automobile insurance companies suppliers and other industry participants insurance companies as payers for many repairs take active roles in the selection of alternative replacement products for vehicle repairs in order to minimize the repair portion of the claims costs and reduce cycle time we also work with insurance companies and vehicle manufacturers to procure salvage vehicles directly from them on a selected basis which provides us with an additional source of supply and offers lower transaction costs to sellers of low value salvage vehicles 

we also provide quality assurance programs that offer additional product support to automobile insurance companies these product support programs identify specific subsets of aftermarket products by vendor and product type that can be used in the repair of vehicles that these companies insure the programs typically offer aftermarket products that have been produced by manufacturers certified by a third party testing lab we may provide additional validation of the quality of the products beyond our standard warranties and identification details that make the products traceable back to a manufacturers specific production run 

broad product offering 

we maintain a broad product offering of vehicle replacement products across our operations in north america and europe the breadth and depth of our inventory reinforces lkqs ability to provide a onestop solution for our customers alternative vehicle replacement product needs customers place a high value on the availability of a broad range of vehicle replacement products in our north american operations we are able to provide the collision and mechanical repair industry with premium products at costs typically 20 to 50 below new oem replacement products the availability of alternative products means that automobiles can be repaired with lower parts costs and in some instances reduced labor costs in fact many insurance companies in north america will not authorize the use of higher cost new oem replacement products if alternative products are available because the use of alternative products provides insurers a method to manage and reduce total repair costs some insurance companies designate us as a preferred supplier for their affiliated repair shops because of our ability to provide these products with our distribution network that reaches most of the major markets in the us and canada combined with our extensive range of products we believe we are the only supplier that is able to support the insurance industry in this manner we believe we are wellpositioned in europe to develop a similar distribution network of a broad product offering to support insurance companies in that market 

high fulfillment rates 

we manage local inventory levels to improve delivery time and maximize customer service improving local order fulfillment rates reduces transfer costs and delivery times and improves customer satisfaction our ability to move inventory throughout our distribution networks increases the availability of replacement products and also helps us to fill a higher percentage of our customers requests 

we deploy inventory management systems at our facilities that are similar to those used by leading distribution companies we make extensive use of bar code technology and wireless data transmission to track parts from the time a vehicle or product arrives at a facility to its placement on a truck for delivery to the customer with this realtime information we are able to actively monitor inventory levels throughout our distribution channels 

technology driven business processes 

we focus on technology development as a way to support our competitive advantage we believe that we can more cost effectively leverage our data to make better business decisions than our smaller competitors we continue to develop our technology to better manage and analyze our inventory assist our salespeople with uptodate pricing and availability of our 

products and further enhance our inventory procurement process for example our bidding specialists responsible for procuring vehicles are equipped with a proprietary software application that compares the vehicles at the salvage auctions to our current inventory historical demand and recent average selling prices to arrive at an estimated maximum bid this bidding system reduces the likelihood of purchasing unneeded parts that might result in obsolete inventory 

we employ proprietary methodologies and information systems to help us identify high demand aftermarket and recycled products our aftermarket inventory systems track products sold and sales lost due to a lack of inventory and make purchase recommendations based on this information the inventory systems also recommend purchases and transfers based on the extent and location of demand as well as other replenishment factors when we procure aftermarket products or refurbish collision replacement products such as wheels bumper covers and lights we focus on products that are in the most demand at all levels of the automotive parts value chain including the professional repair market the jobber market and the general insured repair market because lead times may take 40 days or more on imported products sales volume and instock inventory are important factors in the procurement process we use historical sales records of vehicles by model and year to estimate the demand for our products we also analyze new vehicle designs that are expected to come to market to assure that we are working with suppliers to project future supply and demand trends combining this information with proprietary data that aggregate customer requests for products we are able to source aftermarket products and salvage vehicles at prices that we believe will allow us to sell products profitably 

north america segment 

wholesale automotive products 

our wholesale automobile product operations in north america are organized by geographic regions serving the us and canada that sell all four product types aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured parts to collision and mechanical automobile repair businesses our combined distribution channels for our alternative parts offerings leverage our facility and warehouse costs and improve local product availability by locating multiple product operations together our aftermarket product operations may include a combination of sales warehousing and distribution and in many cases will be colocated with our refurbishing operations our salvage operations typically have processing sales distribution and administrative operations on site indoor and outdoor storage areas and include a large warehouse with multiple bays to dismantle vehicles our engine remanufacturing operations are conducted primarily at our facility in mexico with sales warehousing and distribution operations in the us as of december 31 2013 our north american wholesale operations conducted business from 325 facilities 

wholesale aftermarket products 

our 2013 sales included more than 96000 skus of aftermarket automotive products excluding refurbished products for the most common models of domestic and foreign automobiles and light trucks primarily for the repair of vehicles three to twelve years old our principal aftermarket product types consist of those most frequently damaged in collisions including bumper covers automotive body panels and lights in recent years our expansion into complementary product types such as paint and cooling products contributed to the increase in our available products and has allowed us to better meet our customers repair needs 

platinum plus is our exclusive product line offered in the keystone brand of aftermarket products the platinum plus products are held to high quality standards and tested by quality assurance teams or independent third parties we also developed a product line called value line for more value conscious often selfpay consumers our value line products offer quality products at reasonable prices providing additional choices for repairs or rebuilding of vehicles 

certain of our products are certified by independent organizations such as the certified automotive parts association capa and nsf international nsf capa and nsf are associations that evaluate the functional equivalence of aftermarket collision replacement products to oem collision replacement products members of capa and nsf include insurance companies product distributors including lkq collision repair shops and consumers capa and nsf develop engineering specifications for aftermarket collision replacement products based upon examinations of oem products certify the factories manufacturing processes and quality control procedures used by independent manufacturers and certify the materials fit and finish of specific aftermarket collision replacement products 

lkq is certified under the nsf international automotive parts distributor certification program which addresses the needs of collision repair shops and insurers by maintaining quality management systems to address part traceability service and quality this certification program complements the existing parts certification program with nsf under which lkq has a broad range of certified automotive collision replacement parts many major insurance companies have adopted policies recommending or requiring the use of products certified by capa or nsf a number of capa and nsf certified products are also marketed under the platinum plus brand 

we distribute paint and other materials used in repairing damaged vehicles including sandpaper abrasives masking products and plastic filler the paint and other materials distributed by us are purchased from numerous suppliers in the us and canada 

procurement of inventory 

the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from independent manufacturers and distributors located primarily in the us and taiwan in 2013 approximately 46 of our aftermarket purchases were made from our top five vendors with our largest vendor providing approximately 12 of our inventory we believe we are one of the largest customers of each of these suppliers outside of this group no other supplier provided more than 5 of our supply of aftermarket products in 2013 we purchased approximately 44 of our aftermarket products in 2013 directly from manufacturers in taiwan and other asian countries approximately 56 of our aftermarket products were purchased from vendors located in the us and canada however we believe the majority of these products were manufactured in taiwan mexico or other foreign countries we have business arrangements with manufacturers to produce certain of our products these agreements automatically renew for additional 12 month periods unless written notice is given while we compete with other distributors for production capacity we believe that our sources of supply and our relationships with our suppliers are satisfactory 

we usually receive orders from domestic suppliers within ten days from the date ordered foreign orders typically are shipped in sea containers directly to certain of our aftermarket locations and are received within 40 to 65 days from the date ordered we operate an aftermarket parts warehouse in taiwan that aggregates inventory from certain of our vendors for shipment to our north american locations as of december 31 2013 we operated 24 regional hubs and three distribution centers which act as sources for our warehouse locations that do not receive containers directly and serve as redistribution centers for our operations this structure is designed to maximize our fulfillment rates as smaller branches can have a high fillrate of next day availability 

wholesale recycled products 

our recycled products include engines transmissions door assemblies sheet metal products such as trunk lids fenders and hoods lights and bumper assemblies some insurance companies mandate that the recycled products must be of the same model year or newer as the vehicle being repaired as a result the majority of the products we sell are from vehicles not more than ten years of age installing recycled products often means that collision shops not only save on product cost but because several products may come preassembled the shops are also able to reduce labor costs 

procurement of inventory 

we procure recycled products for our wholesale operations by acquiring damaged or totaled vehicles vehicles that have been declared total losses typically are sold at regional salvage auctions throughout the us and canada salvage auctions charge fees both to the suppliers of vehicles primarily insurance companies and to the purchasers additionally we typically pay third parties fees to tow the vehicles from the auction to our facilities 

the availability of the salvage vehicles we procure for our late model recycled product operations may be impacted by a variety of factors including the production level of new vehicles which provides the source from which salvage vehicles ultimately come and the portion of damaged vehicles declared total losses over the past several years the frequency with which vehicles are declared total losses has increased as a result¸ we believe of the rise in repair costs relative to vehicle replacement cost and salvage vehicle prices in 2000 approximately 9 of accident claims resulted in a total loss by 2013 this percentage increased to almost 14 additionally sales of new vehicles have increased since 2010 and are projected to continue to increase over the next five years which should result in a greater volume of salvage vehicles at auction 

in 2013 we acquired 273000  salvage vehicles for our wholesale recycled product operations primarily from salvage auctions prior to the scheduled auction date our salvage buyers may preview the auctions online to investigate the vehicles to be sold and determine our interest in buying them they obtain key information such as the model and mileage and perform visual damage assessments to determine which parts on the targeted vehicles are recyclable with the data from this preview we deploy a bidding system that performs a valuation calculation for each vehicle in order to recommend a maximum bid price the calculation incorporates demand for a vehicles recyclable parts current inventory levels average selling prices auction costs projected margins and instances of outofstock using this disciplined supply and demand procurement approach we place bids on the targeted vehicles 

vehicle processing 

vehicle processing for our wholesale recycled operations involves dismantling a salvage vehicle into recycled products that are ready for sale when a salvage vehicle arrives at one of our facilities an inventory specialist identifies catalogs and schedules the vehicle for dismantling prior to dismantling we remove from each vehicle its fluids freon and parts containing hazardous substances or precious metals such as catalytic converters the extracted fluids are stored in bulk 

and subsequently sold to recyclers in the case of gasoline the fuel retrieved is primarily used to power our delivery vehicles a small portion of the recycled motor oil we collect is used at certain of our plants that have highefficiency oil burning furnaces the balance is sold to motor oil recyclers 

when ready for dismantling each vehicle has an inventory report that indicates to the dismantler which parts should be removed and placed in a warehouse for future sales to customers which parts should be collected in bulk for our refurbishing and remanufacturing operations or for sale to parts remanufacturers and which parts have value but should remain on the vehicle until sold we utilize bar coding systems and wireless transmission to keep track of inventory from the time a product is removed and inventoried to the time it is sold and put on a truck for delivery 

refurbished and remanufactured products 

as of december 31 2013 we operated 23 plastic bumper and bumper cover refurbishing plants a chrome bumper plating plant 11 wheel refurbishing plants a light refurbishing plant and four engine remanufacturing facilities 

when identifying the products that we refurbish or remanufacture we focus on products that have high demand the majority of our refurbished and remanufactured products are processed from cores obtained from salvage vehicles purchased by our recycled operations and damaged cores collected by our route delivery drivers from vehicles under repair by our customers these products are accumulated from our wholesale operations at our core sorting facilities and are then either sent to our refurbishing or remanufacturing facilities or sold in bulk to other mechanical remanufacturers 

most of our refurbished and remanufactured products are sold through our wholesale distribution channels the balance is sold to retail automotive stores wholesale distributors and via internet sales 

heavyduty truck products 

as of december 31 2013 we operated a total of 26 heavyduty truck facilities in the us and canada our inventory is composed of used heavy and mediumduty trucks usually at least five years old which are purchased at salvage and truck auctions or directly from insurance companies or large fleet operators during 2013 we purchased approximately 8000  vehicles depending on the condition of the vehicles they may be dismantled for parts or resold as running vehicles if certain mechanical parts are damaged such as transmissions we may remanufacture them and offer them to our customers the vehicles that are acquired for resale are typically special purpose or vocational use trucks such as those used for garbage pickup or cement delivery if requested by the sellers of the vehicles we provide an assurance that the vehicles will be sold to foreign buyers and exported to countries for use outside of the us or to domestic buyers after the vehicles have been reconditioned and modified for use other than their original purpose 

scrap and other materials 

our wholesale recycled product operations generate scrap metal and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that have been dismantled for recycled products and crush only end of life vehicles acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site in other cases we will hire mobile crushing equipment to crush the vehicles before they are transported to shredders and scrap metal processors damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products including wheels we also extract and sell the precious metals contained in certain of our salvage parts such as catalytic converters 

customers 

we sell our products to wholesale customers that include collision and mechanical repair shops and new and used car dealerships as well as to retail customers customers of our heavyduty truck products may also include owneroperators local cartage companies or exporters we also generate a portion of our revenue from scrap sales to metal recyclers no single customer accounted for 2 or more of our revenue in 2013 

repair shops and others 

we sell the majority of our wholesale products to collision and mechanical repair shops industry reports estimate there were approximately 40000 collision repair shops including those owned by new car dealerships in the us in 2012 the same reports estimate there were approximately 77000 general including mechanical repair garages excluding new car dealership service departments in the us in 2012 the majority of these customers tend to be individuallyowned small businesses although the number of independent and dealeroperated collision repair facilities has declined over the last decade as regional or national multiple location operators have increased their geographic presence through acquisitions we also sell our products to car rental companies and fleet management groups 

insurance companies 

automobile insurance companies affect the demand for our collision products while insurance companies do not pay for our products directly they ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount as a result insurance companies often influence the types of products used in a repair 

our presence in most major markets in the us and canada gives us a distinctive ability to benefit the major automobile insurance companies insurance companies generally operate at a national or regional level the use of our products provides a direct benefit to these companies by lowering the cost of repairs decreasing the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and providing a replacement product that is of high quality and comparable performance to the part replaced 

we assist insurance companies by providing high quality aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured products to collision repair shops especially to repair shops that are part of an insurance companys direct repair program drp network a repair shop participating in a drp is referred potential work from the insurance company in exchange for providing assurances to the insurance company of quality timeliness and cost industry reports indicate that over half of claims paid for by the top insurance companies in 2012 were paid through a drp compared to 42 in 2009 to meet the needs of the drps professional repairers have been required to become fluent in claims handling we offer our repair shop customers access to our proprietary system keyless which provides a link between their estimating systems and our inventory to identify the availability of alternative products for use in their repair this data also helps insurance companies monitor the body shops compliance with its drp product guidelines that might for instance stipulate the use of the lowest cost products that meet quality specifications in addition in some markets insurance companies are able to dispose of low value total loss vehicles directly to us so they can save the transaction fees associated with selling these vehicles through salvage auctions 

sales and marketing 

in the case of repairs paid for as a result of insurance claims which industry publications estimate are approximately 85 of all repairs insurance companies give collision repair shops directives as to what type of replacement products are eligible for reimbursement typically insurance carriers have established a hierarchy or decision tree prioritizing the types of products to be used for repairs as an example a protocol may require recycled products if available if recycled products are not available then refurbished products and if recycled or refurbished products are not available aftermarket products if none of these alternative product types is available the shop may then use new oem replacement products as a body shop looks for products for a repair the sourcing of products typically begins with a call to one of our recycled operations or one of our competitors our recycled sales personnel are encouraged to capture the sale as a onestop shop and if recycled products are out of stock to fill orders from our refurbished or aftermarket product inventory to support these efforts we have provided our sales staff with access to both recycled and aftermarket sales systems and we have developed sales incentive programs that encourage cross selling throughout our wholesale operations 

as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 2150 fulltime sales staff in our north american wholesale operating segment the full time sales personnel are located at sales desks at our facilities or at one of the regional call centers we operate we deploy a call routing system that redirects overflow calls to alternative call centers typically located within the same region we also operate two other call centers one to support national accounts and the other to support insurance adjusters needs and questions our sales personnel are encouraged to initiate outbound calls in addition to the inbound calls they handle our sales staff can use customer estimates from our keyless estimating system to generate sales leads for both aftermarket and recycled products 

we are continually reviewing and revising the pricing of wholesale products our pricing specialists consider factors such as recent demand levels inventory quantity on hand and turnover rates new oem product prices and local competitive pricing with the goal of optimizing revenue we set list prices and then sell items at a discount to list with the discount typically based on each customers purchasing volume we may adjust prices during the year in response to material price changes of new oem replacement products 

we believe our commitment to stock inventory in local warehouses supplemented by the inventory sharing system within our regional trading zones improves our ability to meet our customers requirements more frequently than our competitors and gives us a competitive advantage 

distribution 

we have a distribution network of 325 wholesale plants and warehouses across the us and canada as of december 31 2013 of which 57 function as large hub or cross dock facilities our network of facilities allows us to develop and maintain our relationships with local repair shops while providing a level of service that is made possible by our nationwide presence our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries as required by our customers using drivers who routinely deliver to the same customers our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local 

repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network 

we have developed an internal distribution network to allow our sales representatives to sell our products within regional trading zones thus improving our ability to fulfill customer requests and accelerating inventory turnover each weekday we operate over 300 transfer runs between our cross dock facilities and our plants and warehouses within our regional trading zones to redistribute our alternative products for delivery on the next day in addition we have approximately 2700 local delivery routes serving our customers each weekday 

each sale results in the generation of a work order at the location housing the specific product a dispatcher is then responsible for ensuring fulfillment accuracy printing the final invoice and including the product on the appropriate truck route for delivery to the customer in markets where we offer more than one alternative product type we are integrating the delivery of multiple product types on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs and improve customer service we operate a delivery fleet of mediumsized trucks and smaller trucks and vans over time we expect that our delivery vehicles will become more consistent as we reconfigure the fleet to include vehicles that can carry all four product types 

competition 

we consider all suppliers of vehicle collision and mechanical products to be competitors including aftermarket suppliers recycling businesses refurbishing operations parts remanufacturers oems and internetbased suppliers we believe the principal areas of differentiation in our industry include availability of inventory pricing product quality and service 

the aftermarket product distribution business is highly fragmented and our competitors other than oems are generally independently owned distributors with one to three distribution centers similarly we compete with domestic vehicle product recyclers most of which are singleunit operators in some markets smaller competitors have organized affiliations to share marketing and distribution resources including internet sites we compete with alternative parts distributors on the basis of our nationwide distribution system our product lines and inventory availability customer service our relationships with insurance companies and to a lesser extent price we do not consider retail chains that focus on the doityourself market to be our direct competitors since many of our wholesale product sales are paid for by insurance companies rather than the end user 

manufacturers of new original equipment products sell the majority of automobile collision replacement products we believe however that the insurance and repair industries recognize advantages of using aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured products for collision repairs industry sources estimate that alternative collision parts usage in the united states is approximately 37 to 38 currently we compete with oems primarily on the basis of price and to a lesser extent on service and product quality 

self service retail products 

our self service retail operations sell parts from older cars and lightduty trucks directly to consumers in addition to revenue from the sale of parts core and scrap we charge a nominal admission fee to access the property our self service facilities typically consist of a fenced or enclosed area of several acres with vehicles stored outdoors and a retail building through which customers are able to access the yard as of december 31 2013 we conducted our self service operations from 65 facilities in north america most of which operate under the name lkq pick your part 

inventory 

we acquire inventory for our self service retail product operations from a variety of sources including but not limited to towing companies auctions the general public municipality sales insurance carriers and charitable organizations we typically procure salvage vehicles that are more than seven model years old for our self service retail product operations these vehicles are generally older and of lower quality than the salvage vehicles we purchase for our wholesale recycled product operations in 2013 we purchased approximately 513000  lower cost self service and crush only vehicles 

vehicles are delivered to our locations by the seller or we arrange for transportation once on our property minimal labor is required to process the vehicle other than removing the fluids freon catalytic converters and hazardous materials vehicles are then placed in the yard for customers to remove parts the vehicle inventory is usually organized according to domestic and import cars further organized by make passenger vans and trucks in our self service business availability of a specific part will depend on which vehicles are currently at the site and to what extent parts may have been previously sold we usually keep a vehicle at our facility for 30 to 75 days generally depending on the capacity of the yard before it is crushed and sold to scrap metal processors by maintaining a relatively short turnover period we ensure that our inventory is continually updated with different car options or removed from the yard when the saleable parts are depleted 

scrap and other materials 

our self service auto recycling operations generate scrap metal alloys and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that we no longer make available to the public and crush only vehicles acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site 

customers 

the customers of our self service yards are frequently doityourself mechanics small independent repair shops servicing older vehicles and auto rebuilders the scrap from the vehicle hulks when not processed by us is sold to metals recyclers with whom we may also compete when procuring salvage vehicles for our operations 

sales and marketing 

we list part prices for automobiles and lightduty trucks on regularly updated price sheets with prices varying by part type but not by make or model for instance four cylinder engines are priced the same regardless of vehicle make model age or condition while we do not consider retail automotive chains to be our direct competitors as their product offerings are focused on maintenance products and mechanical parts we may reference their prices on certain parts as a benchmark to ensure our prices remain competitive 

competition 

there are competitors operating self service businesses in all of the markets in which we operate in some markets there are numerous competitors often operating in close proximity to our operations we try to differentiate our business by the quality of the inventory and the size and cleanliness of the property

our european wholesale operating segment was formed in the fourth quarter of 2011 with our acquisition of ecp a leading distributor of automotive aftermarket parts in the uk ecp has approximately 7000 employees with a large customer base of both commercial and retail accounts more than 80 of ecp’s revenue comes directly from the professional repair segment ecp’s main national distribution center supports its regional hubs and branch network with daily replenishment of stock providing our customers with what we believe to be the highest instock rate in the uk we continued to expand ecp’s distribution network in 2013 by opening 15 new ecp locations in the uk as of december 31 2013 we operated 171 selling locations including aftermarket parts branches and paint distribution locations supported by a national distribution center and 12 regional hubs many of which are colocated with selling locations which allows us to reach most major markets within the uk 

to further expand our european segment in may 2013 we acquired sator headquartered in schiedam the netherlands sator is a market leading distributor of automotive aftermarket parts in western europe sator has over 800 employees at 11 distribution centers that serve a diverse base of repair shops through our warehouse distributor customers in 2013 sators sales included 135000 skus sator generates approximately 90 of its revenue from sales in the netherlands and belgium with the remainder in northern france and other european countries the acquisition of sator expands lkqs european footprint further expands our european distribution network and provides a potential platform to capitalize on the large and fragmented mechanical replacement part markets in europe sator also complements our existing ecp operations in the uk by allowing for the potential realization of cost savings from the leveraging of our combined purchasing power given the significant overlap in suppliers and product mix 

in march 2012 we launched our european aftermarket collision parts program through our ecp branch network we believe the historically low alternative collision parts usage percentage in europe which is currently less than 10 provides an opportunity for us in this segment particularly as insurance companies look to lower their costs to further our commitment to expanding our european alternative collision parts program and becoming a leading onestop shop supplier to the collision repair industry in the uk in august 2013 we acquired five paint distributors that reach most markets within the uk 

with their respective distribution networks it infrastructure and unique customer base we believe ecp and sator will serve as a platform to expand into complementary products to increase market penetration in this segment as well as to further develop a collision repair parts business throughout europe similar to our wholesale operations in north america 

inventory 

our inventory is primarily composed of mechanical aftermarket parts for the repair of vehicles 3 to 15 years old our top selling products include brake pads discs and sensors clutches electrical products such as spark plugs and batteries oil and automotive fluids and filters in 2013 our top six suppliers represented 25 of our inventory purchases with our top 

supplier representing approximately 8 of our purchases no suppliers outside of our top six suppliers provided more than 2 of our purchases during 2013 

the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from vendors located primarily in the uk and continental europe in 2013 we purchased 89 of our products from companies in europe the remaining 11 of our 2013 purchases were sourced from vendors located primarily in china or taiwan some of which also supply collision parts for our wholesale  north american operations 

customers 

in our uk operations we sell the majority of our products to nearly 50000 customers primarily consisting of professional repairers including both independent mechanical repair shops and collision repair shops in addition to our sales to repair shops we generate a portion of our revenue through sales to retail customers from ecp’s ecommerce platform and from counter sales at the branch locations this retail component of ecp’s business has historically represented less than 10 of its revenue 

while sator currently operates under a traditional threestep distribution model in which our immediate customer is the local warehouse distributor the demand for our products is driven by the needs of the same professional repairers we service in our ecp operations during 2013 we supplied over 9500 repair shops through over 450 local warehouse distributor customers sator markets directly to the mechanical repair shops through fliers and other promotional materials and provides software to the repair shops which the shops need for their operations 

sales and marketing 

ecp’s customers will generally call a sales representative at the nearest branch to place an order using an electronic automotive exchange and our integrated it platform displaying inventory availability our sales representatives locate the appropriate replacement part for a customer we set list prices for our products and then apply a discount off of list primarily depending on each customers purchasing volume in 2012 we launched a businesstobusiness website with certain of our customers to enable them to place product orders online through a customized interface that includes detailed parts specifications customerspecific pricing and local branch availability and account information we believe this customer interface will result in fewer parts returns by improving order accuracy and will also reduce the time required by parts specialists to advise customers whether placed via a phone order or online customer orders are filled from the local branch or routed to another location as necessary to fill the order 

sator’s sales and marketing platform is a proprietary stock management system that provides repair shops jobbers and end users with an efficient system for ordering from our product catalog directly online through this online system sator is able to actively monitor inventory levels at all stages in the aftermarket automotive parts value chain in its markets sator offers products from six operating subsidiaries which include van heck  co havam nipparts pauwels harrems tools and belgian van heck interpieces operating as commercially independent units 

similar to our north american wholesale operations insurance companies significantly influence the purchasing decisions for collision products in europe as a result we are attempting to establish business relationships with insurance companies and implement insurerbased marketing models in the uk by emphasizing the cost savings that can be achieved through the use of alternative parts as we continue to grow our collision parts offerings in the uk we believe we will be wellpositioned to serve as a lowercost alternative for insured repairs throughout europe given the majority of uk carriers offer coverage in multiple european countries outside of the uk 

distribution 

our european operations employ a distribution model in which inventory is stored at regional distribution centers or hubs with fast moving product stored at branch locations in our ecp operations or at local warehouse distributor customers in our sator operations for timely delivery to the repair shop customers product is moved through the distribution network on our vans or via common carrier in our ecp operations we also sometimes employ a third party motorcycle fleet to deliver parts from our branch locations to nearby repair shop customers as a result our ecp branches can deliver certain instock parts within one hour 

competition 

we view all suppliers of replacement repair products as our competitors including other alternative parts suppliers and oems and their dealer networks while we compete with all alternative parts suppliers there are few with national distribution networks like ecp and sator that can reach the majority of repair shop customers within the required delivery time we believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other alternative parts suppliers primarily through our distribution network efficient stock management systems and proprietary technology which allows us to deliver our products quickly as well as through 

our product lines and inventory availability pricing and service we compete with oems primarily on the basis of price service and availability 

employees 

as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 23800 employees we are a party to a collective bargaining agreement with a union that represents 42 employees at our totowa new jersey facility approximately 680 of our employees at our bumper refurbishing and engine remanufacturing operations in mexico and 170 of our employees at our recycled parts facility in quebec city canada are also represented by unions other than these locations none of our employees is a member of a union or participates in other collective bargaining arrangements we consider our employee relations to be good 

facilities 

our corporate headquarters are located at 500 west madison street chicago illinois 60661 we operate a field support center in nashville tennessee that performs certain centralized functions for our north american operations including accounting procurement and information systems support our european operations maintain procurement accounting and finance functions in wembley outside of london england and in schiedam netherlands in addition to these offices we have numerous operating facilities that handle wholesale and self service retail product operations we operate out of more than 570  locations in total most of which are leased many of our locations stock multiple product types or serve more than one function 

included in our total locations are 172 facilities in the uk including the 500000 square foot national distribution center in tamworth that houses inventory to supply the hubs and branches of our uk operations we also operate 30 facilities in canada 11 facilities in continental europe five facilities in central america and a facility in mexico additionally we operate an aftermarket parts warehouse in taiwan to aggregate inventory for shipment to our locations in north america 

information technology 

in our north american operations our aftermarket operations use a third party enterprise management system additional third party software packages have been implemented to leverage the centralized data and information that a single system provides such as a data warehouse to conduct enhanced analytics and reporting an integrated budgeting system an electronic data interchange tool and ecommerce tools to enhance our online businesstobusiness initiatives—orderkeystonecom and keyless the systems used by our aftermarket operations are also used by all of our refurbishing operations 

our wholesale recycled product locations in north america operate an internallydeveloped proprietary enterprise management system called lkqx we believe that the use of a single system across all of our wholesale recycled product operations helps facilitate the sales process allows for continued implementation of standard operating procedures and yields improved training efficiency employee transferability access to our national inventory database management reporting and data storage the system also supports an electronic exchange process for identifying and locating parts at other select recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock 

we operate a single enterprise system for all of our heavyduty truck operations that supports interregion sales to reduce the potential for lost sales due to outofstock parts we are also transitioning to a single it platform to support our remanufacturing operations we operate an internallydeveloped point of sale system in our self service retail operations which allows enhanced management reporting as well as improved system reliability 

our aftermarket operations in the uk use a single integrated it platform for our purchasing branch stock and finance activities which are further supported by a distribution center system to manage inventory movement our aftermarket operations in continental europe use several it systems which are linked to transfer data between systems to manage customer orders and inventory movement and for financial reporting purposes 

the hardware that supports the systems used in our operations is located in offsite data centers the centers are in secure environments with aroundtheclock monitoring redundant power backup and multiple diverse data and telecommunication routing we use separate third party provided software for our financial systems such as financial and budget reporting general ledger accounting accounts payable payroll and fixed assets we currently protect our local customer inventory and corporate consolidated data such as financial information email files and other user files with daily backups these backups are stored off site with a third party data protection vendor additionally we restrict access to customer employee and vendor data to those users that have permission granted to them as part of their job function customer credit card information is not stored and the card information is encrypted when it is processed for authorization 

we continually evaluate our systems with the goal of ensuring that all critical systems remain scalable and operational as our business grows 

regulation 

environmental compliance 

our operations and properties are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety in the us as well as other countries in which we operate these environmental laws govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials 

we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters we have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements we cannot assure you however that we will at all times be in complete compliance with such requirements 

although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly environmental laws may change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

contamination resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release storage transportation or disposal of gasoline motor oil antifreeze transmission fluid chlorofluorocarbons cfcs from air conditioners other hazardous materials or metals such as aluminum cadmium chromium lead and mercury contamination from the refurbishment of chrome plated bumpers can occur from the release of the plating material contamination can migrate onsite or offsite which can increase the risk and the amount of any potential liability 

in addition many of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use that may have involved hazardous materials as a result some of our properties may be contaminated some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination even if these owners or operators did not know of and were not responsible for such contamination these environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of treats or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties or successors to such owners or operators for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 

when we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process we analyze the risks and when appropriate perform further environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination furthermore where appropriate we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters in addition at times we or sellers from whom we purchased a business have undertaken remediation projects we do not anticipate based on currently available information and current laws that we will incur liabilities in excess of reserves to address environmental matters however in the event we discover new information or if laws change we may incur significant liabilities which may exceed our reserves 

title laws 

in some states when a vehicle is deemed a total loss a salvage title is issued whether states issue salvage titles is important to the supply of inventory for the vehicle recycling industry because an increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles currently these titling issues are a matter of state law in 1992 the us congress commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle titling registration and salvage since then legislation has been introduced seeking to establish national uniform requirements in this area including a uniform definition of a salvage vehicle the vehicle recycling industry will generally favor a uniform definition since it will avoid inconsistencies across state lines and will generally favor a definition that expands the number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage however certain interest groups including repair shops and some insurance associations may oppose this type of legislation national legislation has not yet been enacted in this area and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in the future 

anticar theft act 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any 

covered major part the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on vehicle recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may discourage the use by such shops of recycled products there is no pending initiative to implement the parts registration from a law enforcement point of view however there is a risk that a heightened legislative concern over safety of parts might precipitate an effort to push for the implementation of such rules 

legislation affecting automotive repair parts 

most states have laws relating to the use of aftermarket products in motor vehicle collision repair work the provisions of these laws include consumer disclosure vehicle owners consent regarding the use of aftermarket products in the repair process and the requirement to have aftermarket products certified by an independent testing organization some jurisdictions have laws that regulate the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags additional laws of this kind may be enacted in the future an increase in the number of states passing such legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on our business additionally congress could enact federal legislation restricting the use of aftermarket and recycled automotive products used in the course of collision repair 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our collision products because there are more weather related accidents which generate repairs 




 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

our operating results and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the economic conditions in the us and elsewhere 

in recent years worldwide economic conditions have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions including the united states and such conditions may worsen in the foreseeable future such conditions have in some periods resulted in fewer miles driven fewer accident claims and a reduction of vehicle repairs all of which could negatively affect our business our sales are also impacted by changes to the economic health of vehicle owners the economic health of vehicle owners is affected by many factors including among others general business conditions interest rates inflation consumer debt levels the availability of consumer credit taxation fuel prices unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending many of these factors are outside of our control if any of these conditions worsen our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

in addition economic conditions including decreased access to credit may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings bankruptcies liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers suppliers logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities and interest rate swap transactions these unfavorable events affecting our business partners could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we face intense competition from local national international and internetbased vehicle products providers and this competition could negatively affect our business 

the vehicle replacement products industry is highly competitive and is served by numerous suppliers of oem recycled aftermarket refurbished and remanufactured products within each of these categories of suppliers there are local owneroperated companies larger regional suppliers national and international providers and internetbased suppliers providers of vehicle replacement products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of vehicle replacement products which may further increase competition some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise greater financial technical manufacturing distribution and other resources longer operating histories lower cost structures and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries or with consumers than we do in certain regions of the us local vehicle recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in the wholesale recycled products industry similarly in europe some local companies are part of cooperative efforts to compete in the aftermarket parts industry as a result of these factors our 

competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply provide their products at lower costs or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve 

we believe that a majority of collision parts by dollar amount are supplied by oems with the balance being supplied by distributors like us the oems are therefore in a position to exert pricing pressure in the marketplace we compete with the oems primarily on price and to a lesser extent on service and quality from time to time oems have experimented with reducing prices on specific products to match the lower prices of alternative products if such price reductions were to become widespread it could have a material adverse impact on our business 

claims by oems relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business 

oems have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims the oems have brought such claims in federal court and with the us international trade commission 

in december 2005 and may 2008 ford global technologies llc filed complaints with the international trade commission against us and others alleging that certain aftermarket products imported into the us infringed on ford design patents the parties settled these matters in april 2009 pursuant to a settlement arrangement that expires in march 2015 in january 2014 chrysler group llc filed a complaint against us in the us district court in the eastern district of michigan contending that certain aftermarket parts we sell infringe chrysler design patents relating to the dodge ram pickup truck the chrysler case is pending 

to the extent oems are seeking and obtaining more design patents than they have in the past and are successful in asserting infringement of these patents and defending their validity we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business we will likely incur significant expenses investigating and defending intellectual property infringement claims in addition aftermarket products certifying organizations may revoke the certification of parts that are the subject of the claims lack of certification may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of aftermarket products only if they have been certified by an independent certifying organization 

an adverse change in our relationships with our suppliers or auction companies could increase our expenses and impede our ability to serve our customers 

our business is dependent on a relatively small number of suppliers of aftermarket products a large portion of which are sourced from taiwan although alternative suppliers exist for substantially all aftermarket products distributed by us the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on us until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced providing products moreover our operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad including among other things natural disasters transportation costs and delays political instability currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs import and export controls and other nontariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas as well as the uncertainty regarding future relations between china japan and taiwan because a substantial volume of our sales involves products manufactured from sheet metal we can be adversely impacted if sheet metal becomes unavailable or is only available at higher prices which we may not be able to pass on to our customers additionally as manufacturers convert to raw materials other than steel it may be more difficult or expensive to source aftermarket parts made with such materials and it may be more difficult for repair shops to work with such materials in the repair process 

  

most of our salvage and a portion of our self service inventory is obtained from vehicles offered at salvage auctions operated by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the us we do not typically have contracts with the auction companies according to industry analysts a small number of companies control a large percentage of the salvage auction market in the us if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions began competing with us or significantly raised its fees our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers moreover we face competition in the purchase of vehicles from direct competitors rebuilders exporters and others to the extent that the number of bidders increases it may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold for wholesale recycled products some states regulate bidders to help ensure that salvage vehicles are purchased for legal purposes by qualified buyers auction companies have been actively seeking to reduce circumvent or eliminate these regulations which would further increase the number of bidders in addition there is a limited supply of salvage vehicles in the us as we grow and our demand for salvage vehicles increases the costs of these incremental vehicles could be higher 

we also acquire inventory directly from insurance companies oems and others to the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue these arrangements our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting 

potential inability to service our customers 

we rely upon insurance companies to promote the usage of alternative parts 

our success depends in part on the acceptance and promotion of alternative parts usage by automotive insurance companies alternative parts usage has generally increased over the past ten years but has stabilized recently there can be no assurance that such usage will be maintained or will increase in the future in addition in some places we operate alternative parts usage is relatively low we also rely on business relationships with insurance companies these insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide the business relationships include in some cases participation in aftermarket quality and service assurance programs that may result in a higher usage of our aftermarket products than would be the case without the programs our arrangements with these companies may be terminated by them at any time including in connection with their own business concerns relating to the offering availability standards or operations of the aftermarket quality and service assurance programs we rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in an illinois lawsuit involving state farm mutual automobile insurance company avery v state farm a jury decided in october 1999 that state farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using nonoem replacement products to repair damaged vehicles when use of such products did not restore the vehicle to its preloss condition the jury found that state farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of nonoem replacement products and the alleged inferiority of those products the jury assessed damages against state farm of 456 million and the judge assessed an additional 730 million of disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the illinois consumer fraud act in april 2001 the illinois appellate court upheld the verdict but reduced the damage award by 130 million because of duplicative damage awards on august 18 2005 the illinois supreme court reversed the awards made by the circuit court and found among other things that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any breach of contract by state farm the us supreme court declined to hear an appeal of this case as a result of this case some insurance companies reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket products our financial results could be adversely affected if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled products from us due to a fear of similar claims 

we may not be able to sell our products due to existing or new laws and regulations prohibiting or restricting the sale of aftermarket recycled refurbished or remanufactured products 

some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled products in addition the federal trade commission ftc has issued guides which regulate the use of certain terms such as “rebuilt” or “remanufactured” in connection with the sale of automotive parts restrictions on the products we are able to sell and on the marketing of such products could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

most states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair work andor require enhanced disclosure or vehicle owner consent before using aftermarket products in such repair work additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future if additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business certain organizations test the quality and safety of vehicle replacement products if these organizations decide not to test a particular vehicle product or in the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product such events could adversely affect our business 

we may not be able to successfully acquire new businesses or integrate acquisitions which could cause our business to suffer 

we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms or for other reasons moreover we may not be able to identify a sufficient number of acquisition candidates at reasonable prices to maintain our growth objectives also over time we will likely seek to make acquisitions that are relatively larger as we grow larger acquisition candidates may attract additional competitive buyers which could increase our cost or could cause us to lose such acquisitions 

if we buy a company or a division of a company we may experience difficulty integrating that companys or divisions personnel and operations which could negatively affect our operating results in addition 

 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control future factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to those listed in the special note on forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k accordingly our results of operations may not be indicative of future performance these fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which could cause our stock price or the value of our debt instruments to decline 

fluctuations in the prices of metals or shipping costs could adversely affect our financial results 

our recycling operations generate scrap metal and other metals that we sell after we dismantle a salvage vehicle for wholesale parts and after vehicles have been used in our self service retail business the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors and other remaining metals are sold to processors and brokers of metals in addition we receive crush only vehicles from other companies including oems which we dismantle and which generate scrap metal and other metals the prices of scrap and other metals have historically fluctuated sometimes significantly due to market factors in addition buyers may stop purchasing metals entirely due to excess supply to the extent that the prices of metals decrease materially or buyers stop purchasing metals our revenue from such sales will suffer and a writedown of our inventory value could be required the cost of our wholesale recycled and our self service retail inventory purchases will change as a result of fluctuating scrap metal and other metals prices in a period of falling metal prices there can be no assurance that our inventory purchasing cost will decrease the same amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal and other metals prices decline and there may be a delay between the scrap metal and other metals price reductions and any inventory cost reductions the price of steel is a component of the cost to manufacture products for our aftermarket business we incur substantial freight costs to import parts from our suppliers many of whom are located in asia if the cost of steel or freight rose we might not be able to pass the cost increases on to our customers 

if we determine that our goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired we may incur significant charges to our pretax income 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations in the future goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of acquisitions goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses increases in our cost of capital adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including modifications that restrict the activities of the acquired business as of december 31 2013  our total goodwill subject to future impairment testing was 19 billion  for further discussion of our annual impairment test see goodwill impairment in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of item 7 in this annual report on form 10k 

we amortize other intangible assets over the assigned useful lives which is based upon the expected period to be benefited we review other intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in the event conditions change that affect our ability to realize the underlying cash 

flows associated with our intangible assets we may record an impairment charge as of december 31 2013 the value of our other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization was 154 million  

if the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines or the number of cars being repaired declines our business could suffer 

our business depends on vehicle accidents and mechanical failures for both the demand for repairs using our products and the supply of recycled remanufactured and refurbished parts thus our business is impacted by factors which influence the number andor severity of accidents and mechanical failures including but not limited to the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven the ages of drivers the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions the congestion of traffic the use of cellular telephones and other electronic equipment by drivers the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers the effectiveness of accident avoidance systems in new vehicles the reliability of new oem parts and the condition of roadways additionally an increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the need for mechanical repairs and maintenance to decline as motorists seek alternative transportation options mild weather conditions particularly during winter months tend to result in a decrease of vehicle accidents moreover a number of states and municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones or other electronic devices while driving and such restrictions could lead to a decline in accidents to the extent oems develop or are mandated by law to install new accident avoidance systems the number and severity of accidents could decrease 

the average number of new vehicles sold annually has fluctuated from yeartoyear periods of decreased sales could result in a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road and consequently fewer vehicles involved in accidents or in need of mechanical repair or maintenance substantial further declines in automotive sales in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition in addition if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of older vehicles on the road insurance companies may find it uneconomical to repair such vehicles or there could be less costly repairs if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of newer vehicles on the road the demand generally for mechanical repairs and maintenance would likely decline due to the newer longerlasting parts in the vehicle population and mechanical failures being covered by oem warranties for the first years of a vehicles life moreover alternative collision and mechanical parts are less likely to be used on newer vehicles 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits 

our operating subsidiaries must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations when we develop or acquire a new facility we must seek the approval of state and local units of government governmental agencies may resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling or refurbishing facility in their communities there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold 

if we lose our key management personnel we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives if we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel which could harm our business 

we rely on information technology and communication systems in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business 

some of the information technology systems and communication systems we use for management of our facilities and our financial functions are leased from or operated by other companies while others are owned by us in the event that the providers of these systems terminate their relationships with us or if we suffer prolonged outages of these or our own systems for whatever reason we could suffer disruptions to our operations 

in addition we continually monitor these systems to find areas for improvement in the event that we decided to switch providers or to implement our own systems we may also suffer disruptions to our business we may be unsuccessful in the development of our own systems and we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing our own systems also our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system which period could 

extend longer than we anticipated 

our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and employees we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information however if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to damage to our reputation additional costs lost sales or possible regulatory action the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly changing and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our operations the function of our computer systems andor the availability and distribution of merchandise which may affect our business 

weather terrorist activities war or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in the closure of our distribution centers “dc”s or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory through our system on a timely basis this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states or into the other countries in which we operate and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks our business could be harmed 

we use a fleet of trucks to deliver the majority of the products we sell we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in the transportation infrastructure governmental regulation availability and price of fuel liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance and insurance premium increases in addition our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials 

under certain environmental laws we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at or migration to or from our or our predecessors past or present facilities and at independent waste disposal sites these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or was not responsible for the release of such hazardous substances 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we could be subject to product liability claims and involved in product recalls 

if customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage we could be subject to product liability claims by such customers the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we may become involved in the recall of a product that is determined to be defective the expenses of a recall and the damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

we have agreed to defend and indemnify in certain circumstances insurance companies and customers against claims and damages relating to product liability and product recalls the existence of claims or damages for which we must defend and indemnify these parties could also negatively impact our business results of operations or financial condition 

regulations that may be issued under the anticar theft act could harm our business 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any covered major part the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on automotive parts recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may discourage the use of recycled products by such shops 

we operate in foreign jurisdictions which exposes us to foreign exchange and other risks 

we have operations in the uk canada mexico taiwan the netherlands belgium france guatemala and costa rica and we may expand our operations into other countries our foreign operations expose us to additional risks associated with international business which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition including import and export requirements and compliance with anticorruption laws such as the uk bribery act 2010 and the foreign corrupt practices act we also incur costs in currencies other than our functional currencies in the countries in which we operate we are thus subject to foreign exchange exposure to the extent that we operate in different currencies as well as exposure to foreign tax and other foreign and domestic laws in addition mexico is currently experiencing a heightened level of criminal activity that could affect our ability to maintain our supply of certain aftermarket products 

new regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and otherwise adversely impact our business  

in august 2012 as mandated by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec adopted final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals originating from the democratic republic of congo drc or adjoining countries these new requirements will require ongoing due diligence efforts with initial disclosure requirements beginning in 2014 our supply chain is complex and we may incur significant costs to determine the source of any such minerals used in our products we may also incur costs with respect to potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of our diligence activities further the implementation of these rules and their effect on customer supplier andor consumer behavior could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering products free of conflict minerals in some circumstances we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary products from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflictfree or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement accordingly the implementation of these rules could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition 

risks relating to our common stock and financial structure 

future sales of our common stock or other securities may depress our stock price 

we and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock or other equity debt or instruments which constitute an element of our debt and equity collectively securities in the future we may also issue shares of common stock under our equity incentive plan or in connection with future acquisitions we cannot predict the size of future issuances of securities or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock or other securities will have on the price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued in connection with an acquisition the issuance of additional debt securities or the perception that such sales or issuances could occur may cause the price of our common stock to fall 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in addition stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline additionally the market price for our common stock has been in the past and in the future may be adversely affected by allegations made or reports issued by short sellers analysts or others regarding our business model our management or our financial accounting 

following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

delaware law our charter documents and our loan documents may impede or discourage a takeover which could affect the price of our stock 

the antitakeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws our loan documents and delaware law could together or separately impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult our credit agreement provides that a change of control is an event of default our incorporation under delaware law and these provisions could also impede an acquisition takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the price of our common stock 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to react to changes in our business 

as of december 31 2013  we had 13058 million  aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding our significant amount of debt and our debt service obligations could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations limit our ability to operate our business and impair our competitive position 

for example it could 

 

as of december 31 2013  we also had 10706 million  of undrawn availability after giving effect to approximately 456 million  of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility and 800 million  of undrawn availability under our accounts receivable securitization program in january 2014 we increased our borrowings under our revolving credit facility by 370 million and borrowed the full amount available under our accounts receivable securitization program primarily to finance our acquisition of keystone specialty if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the ability to service such debt would increase 

our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability among other things to 

 

as a result of these covenants and restrictions we will be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit agreement a default if not waived could result in acceleration of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing credit facilities or it may be on terms that are not acceptable to us 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due any future refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations additionally the senior secured credit facilities limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition of our assets as a result our senior secured credit facilities may prevent us from using the proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy our debt service obligations 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly 

certain borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and the borrowing under our accounts receivable securitization facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness would correspondingly decrease 

we rely on an accounts receivable securitization program for a portion of our liquidity 

we have an arrangement whereby we sell an interest in a portion of our accounts receivable to a special purpose vehicle and receive funding through the commercial paper market this arrangement expires in september 2015 in the event that the market for commercial paper were to close or otherwise become constrained our cost of credit relative to this program could rise or credit could be unavailable altogether 

our future capital needs may require that we seek to refinance our debt or obtain additional debt or equity financing events that could have a negative effect on our business 

we may need to raise additional funds in the future to among other things refinance existing debt fund our existing operations improve or expand our operations respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions from time to time we may raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic alliances or other arrangements however turmoil in the credit markets could result in tight credit conditions which could affect our ability to raise additional funds if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and further limitations on our operations if we refinance or restructure our debt we may incur charges to write off the unamortized portion of deferred debt issuance costs from a previous financing or we may incur charges related to hedge ineffectiveness from our interest rate swap obligations if we fail to raise capital when needed our business may be negatively affected 

a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our senior unsecured notes 

credit ratings have an important effect on our cost of capital the evaluations are based upon among other factors our financial strength we believe our current credit ratings enhance our ability to borrow funds at favorable rates a downgrade in our current credit rating from a rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facilities a downgrade could also adversely affect the market price andor liquidity of our notes preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend overview 

we provide replacement parts components and systems needed to repair cars and trucks buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers oems which are commonly known as oem products new products produced by companies other than the oems which are sometimes referred to as aftermarket products recycled products obtained from salvage vehicles used products that have been refurbished and used products that have been remanufactured 

we distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops including aftermarket collision and mechanical products recycled collision and mechanical products refurbished collision products such as wheels bumper covers and lights and remanufactured engines collectively we refer to these products as alternative parts because they are not new oem products we are the nation’s largest provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and a leading provider of alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products with our sales processing and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the united states our wholesale operations also reach most major markets in canada we are a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement products in the united kingdom and in the second quarter of 2013 we expanded our operations into continental europe through the acquisition of sator a leading distributor of automotive aftermarket products in the benelux region in addition to our wholesale operations we operate self service retail facilities across the us that sell recycled automotive products we have organized our businesses into three operating segments wholesale  north america wholesale  europe and self service we aggregate our north american operating segments wholesale  north america and self service into one reportable segment resulting in two reportable segments north america and europe 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to those listed in the special note on forwardlooking statements in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k accordingly our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance 

acquisitions and investments 

since our inception in 1998 we have pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions we have pursued acquisitions that we believe will help drive profitability cash flow and stockholder value our principal focus for acquisitions is companies that are market leaders will expand our geographic presence and enhance our ability to provide a wide array of automotive products to our customers through our distribution network 

on may 1 2013 we acquired sator a vehicle mechanical aftermarket parts distribution company based in the netherlands with operations in the netherlands belgium and northern france with the acquisition of sator we expanded our geographic presence in the european vehicle mechanical aftermarket products market into continental europe to complement our existing uk operations 

sator currently employs a three step distribution model by selling products to various distributors that service the end customer as a result the line item results vary from our uk business which operates a two step distribution model while sator generates a lower gross margin rate than ecp sator should be able to gain more leverage in operating expenses as it does not require the same infrastructure in facilities distribution and selling to service its customers 

in addition to our acquisition of sator we made 19  acquisitions during 2013  including 10  wholesale businesses in north america 7  wholesale businesses in europe and 2  self service operations our european acquisitions included five automotive paint distribution businesses in the uk which enabled us to expand our collision product offerings the other acquisitions completed during 2013  enabled us to expand into new product lines and enter new markets 

in august 2013 we entered into an agreement with suncorp group a leading general insurance group in australia and new zealand to develop an alternative vehicle replacement parts business in those countries under the terms of the agreement we will contribute our experience to help establish automotive parts recycling operations and to facilitate the procurement of aftermarket parts while suncorp will supply salvage vehicles to the venture as well as assist in establishing relationships with repair shops as customers our investment will expand our geographic presence into australia and new zealand and will provide the opportunity to establish a leadership position in the supply of alternative parts in those countries 

on january 3 2014 we completed our acquisition of keystone automotive holdings inc “keystone specialty” keystone specialty is a leading distributor and marketer of specialty aftermarket equipment and accessories in north america serving the following six product segments truck and offroad speed and performance recreational vehicle towing wheels 

tires and performance handling and miscellaneous accessories our acquisition of keystone specialty allows us to enter into new product lines and increase the size of our addressable market in addition we believe that the acquisition creates potential logistics and administrative cost synergies and crossselling opportunities 

also in january 2014 we completed the acquisition of a us based distributor of automotive cores as well as new and remanufactured mechanical automotive replacement parts we believe this acquisition will expand our core and remanufactured product mix and will allow us to expand our product offering to include certain parts also purchased by oems in february 2014 we acquired a wholesale salvage operation and a self service operation in north america which we believe will expand our market share in the respective markets 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we made 30 acquisitions in north america including 22 wholesale businesses and 8 self service retail operations these acquisitions enabled us to expand our geographic presence and to enter new markets additionally two of our acquisitions were completed with a goal of improving the recovery from scrap and other metals harvested from the vehicles we purchase a precious metals refining and reclamation business and a scrap metal shredder 

in october 2011 we expanded our operations into the european automotive aftermarket business through our acquisition of ecp ecps product offerings are primarily focused on automotive aftermarket mechanical products many of which are sourced from the same suppliers that provide products to the oems the expansion of our geographic presence beyond north america into the european market offers an opportunity to us as that market has historically had a low penetration of alternative collision parts in addition to our ecp acquisition we completed 20 acquisitions in north america in 2011 17 wholesale businesses and 3 self service retail operations which allowed us to increase our product offerings to expand our geographic presence and to enter new markets 

sources of revenue 

we report our revenue in two categories i parts and services and ii other our parts and services revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle replacement products and related services including i aftermarket other new and refurbished products and ii recycled remanufactured and related products and services during the year ended december 31 2013  sales of vehicle replacement products and services represented approximately 87  of our consolidated sales 

we sell the majority of our vehicle replacement products to collision and mechanical repair shops our vehicle replacement products include sheet metal crash parts such as doors hoods and fenders bumper covers engines head and tail lamps and wheels the demand for our products and services is influenced by several factors including the number of vehicles in operation the number of miles being driven the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents the age profile of vehicles in accidents the availability and pricing of new oem parts seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions additionally automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process accordingly we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our products while they are not our direct customers we do provide insurance carriers services in an effort to promote the increased usage of alternative replacement products in the repair process such services include the review of vehicle repair order estimates direct quotation services to insurance company adjusters and an aftermarket parts quality and service assurance program we neither charge a fee to the insurance carriers for these services nor adjust our pricing of products for our customers when we perform these services for insurance carriers 

there is no standard price for many of our products but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as product availability quality demand new oem product prices the age and mileage of the vehicle from which the part was obtained competitor pricing and our product cost 

in 2013  revenue from other sources represented approximately 13  of our consolidated sales these other sources include scrap sales and sales of aluminum ingots and sows we derive scrap metal from several sources including vehicles that have been used in both our wholesale and self service recycling operations and from oems and other entities that contract with us for secure disposal of crush only vehicles other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold 

cost of goods sold 

our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts freight and overhead costs related to the purchasing warehousing and distribution of our inventory including labor facility and equipment costs and depreciation our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors our cost of goods sold for refurbished products includes the price we pay for cores freight and costs to refurbish the parts including direct and indirect labor facility and equipment costs depreciation and other overhead related to our refurbishing operations 

our cost of goods sold for recycled products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and where applicable auction towing and storage fees prices for salvage vehicles may be impacted by a variety of factors including the number of buyers competing to purchase the vehicles the demand and pricing trends for used vehicles the number of vehicles designated as “total losses” by insurance companies the production level of new vehicles which provides the source from which salvage vehicles ultimately come and the status of laws regulating bidders or exporters of salvage vehicles due to changes relating to these factors we have seen the prices we pay for salvage vehicles fluctuate over time our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles our labor and laborrelated costs related to acquisition and dismantling account for between 8 and 10 of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle the acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and as a result energy costs are not material our cost of goods sold for remanufactured products includes the price we pay for cores freight and costs to remanufacture the products including direct and indirect labor facility and equipment costs depreciation and other overhead related to our remanufacturing operations 

some of our salvage mechanical products are sold with a standard sixmonth warranty against defects additionally some of our remanufactured engines are sold with a standard threeyear warranty against defects we also provide a limited lifetime warranty for certain of our aftermarket products that is supported by certain of the suppliers of those products we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claims information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses 

 other revenue is primarily generated from the hulks and unusable parts of the vehicles we acquire for our wholesale and self service recycled product operations and therefore the costs of these sales include the proportionate share of the price we pay for the salvage vehicles as well as the applicable auction storage and towing fees and internal costs to purchase and dismantle the vehicles our cost of goods sold for other revenue will fluctuate based on the prices paid for salvage vehicles which may be impacted by a variety of factors as discussed above 

expenses 

our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our aftermarket warehouses salvage yards and self service retail facilities these costs include personnel expenses such as wages incentive compensation and employee benefits for plant management and facility and warehouse personnel as well as rent for our facilities and related utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance the costs included in facility and warehouse expenses do not relate to inventory processing or conversion activities and as such are classified below the gross margin line on our consolidated statements of income 

our distribution expenses primarily include our costs to prepare and deliver our products to our customers included in our distribution expense category are personnel costs such as wages employee benefits and incentive compensation for drivers third party freight costs fuel and expenses related to our delivery and transfer trucks including vehicle leases repairs and maintenance and insurance 

our selling and marketing expenses primarily include salary commission and other incentive compensation expenses for sales personnel advertising promotion and marketing costs credit card fees telephone and other communication expenses and bad debt expense personnel costs account for approximately 80 of our selling and marketing expenses most of our sales personnel are paid on a commission basis the number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our customers’ needs and increase our sales volume our objective is to continually evaluate our sales force develop and implement training programs and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness 

our general and administrative expenses primarily include the costs of our corporate offices and field support center which provide management treasury accounting legal payroll business development human resources and information systems functions general and administrative expenses include wages and benefits for corporate regional and administrative personnel stockbased compensation and other incentive compensation information systems support and maintenance expenses and accounting legal and other professional fees 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather related accidents which generate repairs 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the 

reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition inventory valuation business combinations and goodwill impairment we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue actual results may differ from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize and report revenue from the sale of vehicle replacement products when they are shipped or picked up by the customers and title has transferred subject to an allowance for estimated returns discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information a product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment our customers may earn discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment we analyze historical returns and allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates we use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold if actual returns and allowances are higher than our historical experience there would be an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence 

we recognize revenue from the sale of scrap cores and other metals when title has transferred which typically occurs upon delivery to the customer 

inventory accounting 

aftermarket and refurbished product inventory  our aftermarket inventory cost is established based on the average price we pay for parts and includes expenses incurred for freight and overhead costs for items purchased from foreign companies import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included refurbished inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for cores and also includes expenses incurred for freight labor and other overhead related to our refurbishing operations 

salvage and remanufactured inventory  our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle including auction towing and storage fees as well as expenditures for buying and dismantling vehicles inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facilitys inventory at expected selling prices the assessment of which incorporates the sales probability based on a parts days in stock and historical demand the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facilitys historical profitability for salvage vehicles remanufactured inventory cost is based upon the price paid for cores and also includes expenses incurred for freight direct manufacturing costs and overhead related to our remanufacturing operations 

for all inventory carrying value is recorded at the lower of cost or market and is reduced to reflect current anticipated demand if actual demand differs from our estimates additional reductions to inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made 

business combinations 

we record our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values we utilize management estimates and in some instances independent thirdparty valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and contingent consideration granted such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions including projections of future events and operating performance the purchase price allocation is subject to change during the measurement period which is limited to one year subsequent to the acquisition date 

for certain acquisitions we may issue contingent consideration under which additional payments will be made to the former owners if specified future events occur or conditions are met such as meeting profitability or earnings targets each contingent consideration obligation is measured at the acquisition date fair value of the consideration which is determined using the discounted probabilityweighted expected cash flows at each subsequent reporting period we remeasure the liability at fair value and record any changes to the fair value through change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities within other expense income on our consolidated statements of income the fair value measurement of the liability is performed by our corporate accounting department using current information about key assumptions with the input and oversight of our operational and executive management teams each reporting period we evaluate the performance of the business compared to our previous expectations along with any changes to our future projections and update the estimated cash flows accordingly in addition we consider changes to our cost of capital and changes to the probability of achieving the earnout payment targets when updating our discount rate on a quarterly basis 

 increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates variances between actual results achieved and projected results changes in the projected results of the acquired business or changes in our assessment of the probabilities surrounding the achievement of targets detailed in the respective agreements as of december 31 2013  we recorded 557 million  of contingent consideration liabilities of this amount 497 million  represents the maximum payment for the 2013 performance period related to our 2011 acquisition of ecp which we expect to pay in the first quarter of 2014 

goodwill impairment 

we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually when testing goodwill for impairment we are required to evaluate events and circumstances that may affect the performance of the reporting unit and the extent to which the events and circumstances may impact the future cash flows of the reporting unit to determine whether the fair value of the assets exceed the carrying value if these assumptions or estimates change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill 

we are organized into three operating segments wholesale—north america wholesale—europe and self service we have also concluded that these three  operating segments are reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing in 2013  we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist during 2013  we did not identify any events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts therefore we did not perform any impairment tests other than our annual test in the fourth quarter of 2013  

our goodwill would be considered impaired if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value the fair value estimates are established using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach we believe that using two methods to determine fair value limits the chances of an unrepresentative valuation as of december 31 2013  we had a total of 19 billion  in goodwill subject to future impairment tests if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results we determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2013  a 25 decrease in the fair value estimates of the reporting units in the annual impairment test would not have changed this determination and each of the reporting units had a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value

results of operations—consolidated 

the following table sets forth statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated 



year ended december 31 2013  compared to year ended december 31 2012   

revenue  our revenue increased 228  to 51 billion  for the year ended   december 31 2013  from 41 billion  in 2012 the increase in revenue was due to 138  acquisition related revenue growth and 93  organic growth reflecting 110  growth in parts and services revenue partially offset by a 15  decline in other revenue partially offset by a 04  unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange primarily in our european operations refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to revenue growth during 2013 compared to the prior year 

cost of goods sold  our cost of goods sold increased to 590  of revenue in 2013  from 582  of revenue in 2012 in 2013 our cost of goods sold reflects a 07 increase as a percentage of revenue as a result of the lower gross margins generated by certain of our acquisitions including our 2013 acquisitions of sator and five ukbased paint distribution businesses as well as our june 2012 acquisition of a precious metals refining and reclamation business in the prior year period we recognized a gain on lawsuit settlements totaling 179 million that did not reoccur in 2013 thus accounting for 04 of the increase in the current year cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue see note 7 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the lawsuit settlements these increases in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue were partially offset by 04 improvement in gross margin in our salvage operations within our wholesale  north america segment which reflects the impact of various individually insignificant factors the largest of which were lower vehicle costs and pricing improvements 

facility and warehouse expenses  as a percentage of revenue facility and warehouse expenses for the year ended   december 31 2013  remained flat at 84  of revenue our north american operations increased facility and warehouse expense by 02 of revenue which reflects increased weighting of our self service business during 2012 we completed the acquisition of eight self service retail operations which generally incur greater facility costs as a percentage of revenue compared to our wholesale operations as our self service business tends to require a larger facility footprint to generate its sales higher costs in north america were offset by a greater proportion of revenue generated by our european operations which incur lower facility warehouse costs as a percentage of revenue combined with improved leveraging of facility and warehouse personnel in our uk operations related to 56 new branch openings completed since the beginning of 2012 

distribution expenses  as a percentage of revenue distribution expenses decreased to 85  of revenue in 2013 from 91  of revenue in 2012 in our north american operations improved leveraging of our distribution workforce contributed 02 of the reduction in distribution expenses as a percentage of revenue fuel expense also decreased by 01 of revenue due to a reduction in the average price we pay for fuel our european operations contributed the remainder of the decrease including a 02 benefit from our 2013 european acquisitions as well as a 01 benefit from our existing uk operations primarily as a result of improved leverage related to 56 new branch openings since the beginning of 2012 

selling general and administrative expenses  our selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended   december 31 2013  decreased to 118  of revenue from 120  during the prior year the reduction of these expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects an approximately equal impact from improved leveraging of general and administrative overhead costs and the relatively lower general and administrative expenses incurred by our sator business compared to our other operations 

restructuring and acquisition related expenses  during 2013 and 2012 we incurred 102 million  and 28 million  of restructuring and acquisition related expenses respectively during the year ended december 31 2013 we incurred 67 million of acquisition related expenses which include external costs primarily related to our acquisitions of sator five automotive paint distribution businesses in the uk and our january 2014 acquisition of keystone specialty during 2013 we also incurred 35 million related to the integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations primarily in our european segment our 2012 restructuring and acquisition related expenses included 11 million related to the consolidation of our bumper and wheel refurbishing operations 12 million related to the integration of certain of our acquisitions into our existing business and 05 million of acquisition related expenses see note 9 restructuring and acquisition related expenses  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our restructuring and integration plans 

depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization expense was 16  during each of the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 higher expense in 2013 resulting from our increased levels of property and equipment and higher levels of intangible assets as a result of business acquisitions was offset by revenue growth 

other expense net  total other expense net increased to 544 million  for the year ended   december 31 2013  from 288 million  for the prior year this increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of 198 million  compared to the prior year which reflects an approximately equal impact of higher outstanding debt balances and higher interest rates primarily as a result of the senior notes issued in may in may 2013 we executed an amended and restated senior secured credit agreement and as a result we expensed a portion of capitalized debt issuance costs related to the prior agreement as well as a portion of the fees incurred with the amendment the resulting loss on debt extinguishment in 2013 totaled 28 million  the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in the canadian dollar the british pound and other currencies was a loss of 24 million during 2013 compared to a gain of 02 million during 2012 in 2013 we recognized expense of 25 million  as a result of fair value adjustments to our contingent payment liabilities compared to 16 million  in 2012 

provision for income taxes  our effective income tax rate was 345  and 362  for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012 respectively we continued to expand our international operations throughout 2012 and 2013 with both acquisition related and organic revenue growth in our european segment as well as through acquisitions in canada the lower effective income tax rate in 2013 reflects a 14 benefit relative to the prior year as a result of this growth in our international operations where a larger proportion of our pretax income was generated in lower rate jurisdictions the effect of lower state income taxes other discrete items and permanent differences contributed the remaining 03 reduction in the effective tax rate compared to the prior year 

year ended december 31 2012  compared to year ended december 31 2011   

revenue  our revenue increased 261 to 41 billion for the year ended december 31 2012 from 33 billion in 2011 the increase in revenue was due to 219 acquisition related revenue growth and 41 organic growth which was composed of 60 parts and services revenue partially offset by a 58 decline in other revenue due to declining scrap steel and other metals prices acquisition related revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2012 totaled 7168 million which included 4816 million from our fourth quarter 2011 acquisition of ecp our organic revenue growth in aftermarket other new and refurbished products of 62 was primarily a result of higher volumes incremental sales volume from ecps new branches which we include in organic revenue contributed 44 of the growth the remaining volume increase was primarily attributable to greater customer penetration resulting from our expansion into complementary product lines such as paint and related products our organic revenue from the sale of recycled and remanufactured products grew 58 primarily as a result of higher sales volumes which resulted from higher inventory purchases that contributed to a greater volume of parts available for sale organic revenue growth in parts and services was negatively affected by milder winter weather conditions in north america in the first quarter and into the beginning of the second quarter of 2012 as the milder winter weather contributed to fewer and less severe vehicle accidents resulting in lower insurance claims activity 

cost of goods sold  our cost of goods sold increased to 582 of revenue in 2012 from 574 of revenue in 2011 in 2012 the prices we received for scrap metal declined relative to the cost of the scrap component of the cars that we crushed while in the prior year scrap metal prices increased relative to the cost component the resulting margin compression in our self service and wholesale  north america segments contributed 06 of the increase in cost of goods sold our acquisition of ecp which generates lower gross margins than our north american business because of a greater weighting on lower margin mechanical products increased our cost of goods sold by 03 of revenue our cost of goods sold for the year ended 

december 31 2012 also reflects a 02 increase as a result of the lower gross margins generated by our precious metals refining and reclamation business that we acquired in the second quarter of 2012 higher warranty claims experience in 2012 primarily related to our remanufactured engines increased cost of goods sold by 02 of revenue our cost of goods sold for 2012 also reflects lower levels of revenue from high margin crush only vehicles compared to the prior year which increased cost of goods sold by 02 these increases in our cost of goods sold were partially offset by a 02 reduction in cost of goods sold for lower vehicle acquisition costs primarily in our wholesale  north america segment additionally we recognized a gain on lawsuit settlements totaling 179 million which reduced cost of goods sold by 04 of revenue see note 7 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the lawsuit settlements 

facility and warehouse expenses  as a percentage of revenue facility and warehouse expenses for the year ended december 31 2012 decreased to 84 of revenue compared to 90 in 2011 which was primarily due to lower facility and warehouse expense in our ecp operations as compared to our north american operations the branch locations in the uk are typically smaller and less costly than the warehouse locations in north america since the majority of the inventory is stored in the national distribution center in the uk which supplies the branch locations daily in our north american operations most of the inventory sold by our locations is stored on site rather than in regional or national distribution centers the cost of the national distribution center in the uk is capitalized into inventory and expensed through cost of goods sold 

distribution expenses  as a percentage of revenue distribution expenses increased to 91 of revenue in 2012 from 88 of revenue in 2011 primarily resulting from an increase of 02 related to our european operations our ecp operations which generate a greater proportion of revenue from sales to mechanical repair shops compared to our north american operations incur relatively higher delivery expenses as garage customers demand faster delivery times than our north american collision repair customers in our north american operations distribution expenses increased by 02 of revenue due to higher compensation costs as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior year 

selling general and administrative expenses  our selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2012 were consistent with the prior year at 120 of revenue our ecp operations increased selling general and administrative expenses by 02 of revenue primarily due to greater personnel expenditures for the relatively larger sales force compared to our north american operations the impact of higher selling expenses in our european operations was offset by a reduction in general and administrative personnel expenditures including incentive compensation as a percentage of revenue in our north american operations 

restructuring and acquisition related expenses  during 2012 and 2011 we incurred 28 million and 76 million of restructuring and acquisition related expenses respectively in 2012 we incurred 11 million to execute our restructuring plan to consolidate our bumper and wheel refurbishing product lines we also incurred 12 million of restructuring expenses related to the integration of certain of our 2011 and 2012 acquisitions into our existing business our 2011 expenses included 40 million related to integration of our 2011 acquisition of the akzo nobel paint business and our 2010 acquisition of cross canada a canadian aftermarket business we also incurred 04 million of integration costs related to certain of our other acquisitions acquisition related expenses which consist of external costs such as closing costs and professional fees totaled 05 million and 32 million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively our acquisition related expenses in 2011 primarily related to our acquisition of ecp on october 1 2011 see note 9 restructuring and acquisition related expenses  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our restructuring and integration plans 

depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization expense was 16 in 2012 compared to 15 in 2011 higher expense in 2012 resulting from our increased levels of property and equipment and higher levels of intangible assets as a result of business acquisitions was mostly offset by continued leveraging of our existing facilities to support organic revenue growth 

other expense net  total other expense net increased to 288 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from 257 million for the prior year this increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of 71 million compared to the prior year partially offset by a 53 million loss on debt extinguishment recognized in 2011 related to the write off of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the execution of our senior secured credit agreement the increase in interest expense in 2012 was due to higher average outstanding bank borrowings of 922 million compared to 671 million in 2011 primarily as a result of additional borrowings to finance our acquisition of ecp in the fourth quarter of 2011 the effect of higher average debt levels was partially offset by a reduction in our average effective interest rate on bank borrowings to 31 in 2012 from 34 in 2011 resulting from lower interest rates under our credit agreement in 2012 we recognized 16 million of expense as a result of fair value adjustments to our contingent payment liabilities while we recognized a 14 million gain in 2011 adjustments to our contingent consideration liabilities may cause variability in our results of operations as changes in the assumptions used to measure the fair value of the liabilities may result in net gains or losses from period to period we increased our collections of fees for late payments in 2012 which increased other income by 16 million over the prior year 

in 2012 the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in the canadian dollar the british pound and other currencies was a gain of 02 million compared to a loss of 04 million in 2011 

provision for income taxes  our effective income tax rate was 362 and 374 for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the lower effective income tax rate in 2012 reflects a benefit of 15 relative to the prior year from our expanding international operations as a larger proportion of our pretax income was generated in lower rate jurisdictions other rate effects from discrete items and permanent differences were 03 higher in 2012 than the prior year 

results of operations—segment reporting 

we have three operating segments wholesale—north america wholesale—europe and self service our operations in north america which include our wholesale—north america and self service operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services customers and methods of distribution our wholesale—europe operating segment is presented as a separate reportable segment 

the following table presents our financial performance including revenue and earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization “ebitda” by reportable segment for the periods indicated in thousands 

  



the key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker is ebitda segment ebitda includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment corporate and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment’s percentage of consolidated revenue segment ebitda excludes depreciation amortization interest including loss on debt extinguishment and taxes loss on debt extinguishment is considered a component of interest in calculating ebitda as the writeoff of debt issuance costs is similar to the treatment of debt issuance cost amortization see note 13 segment and geographic information  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a reconciliation of total ebitda to net income 

since we presented a single reportable segment north america until the acquisition of ecp effective october 1 2011 our european segment did not have a full comparative prior year period for the year ended december 31 2012  for information on the factors that contributed to the results of our north american operations during 2013 compared to 2012 including the effect of our european operations on our consolidated year over year results refer to our consolidated results of operations discussion above 

year ended december 31 2013  compared to year ended december 31 2012   

north america 

revenue  revenue in our north american segment increased 110 to 38 billion during the year ended december 31 2013 from 34 billion during the prior year the increase in revenue reflects 64 acquisition related revenue growth and 48 organic growth which included 60 organic growth in parts and services revenue offset by 16 decrease in other revenue partially offset by 02 unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates primarily in our canadian operations our organic growth in parts and services revenue was primarily due to higher sales volumes in the first half of the prior year we experienced milder winter weather conditions which contributed to fewer and less severe vehicle accidents resulting in lower insurance claims additionally current year sales volumes benefited from higher inventory purchases compared to the prior year which contributed to a greater volume of parts available for sale the decrease in other revenue was primarily a result of 

a reduction in sales volume from our furnace operations partially offset by an increased volume of scrap and core revenue from our salvage operations 

ebitda  as a percentage of revenue ebitda in our north american segment decreased to 127 during the year ended december 31 2013 from 129 in the prior year in the prior year we recognized a gain on lawsuit settlements totaling 179 million which decreased ebitda as a percentage of revenue by 05 relative to the prior year as it did not reoccur in 2013 our precious metals refining and reclamation business which generates lower margins as a percentage of revenue contributed 02 of the decline of ebitda primarily due to including a full year of results in 2013 compared to only seven months in 2012 in our self service operations a narrowing spread between the prices received for scrap and other metals and the cost of the scrap component of the cars that we crushed resulted in a decrease in ebitda of 02 of revenue these decreases were partly offset by a 05 improvement in ebitda margin from our wholesale salvage operations which reflects the impact of various individually insignificant factors the largest of which were lower vehicle costs and pricing improvements lower operating expenses increased ebitda by 02 of revenue as a result of improved leverage of our distribution workforce and lower fuel costs partially offset by higher facility costs in our self service operations 

europe 

revenue  revenue in our european segment increased to 13 billion during the year ended december 31 2013 an 810 increase over 6961 million of revenue generated in the prior year the increase in revenue includes 504 acquisition related revenue growth primarily as a result of our sator acquisition in may 2013 and 318 organic revenue growth our organic revenue growth was a result of higher sales volumes including a 208 increase from stores open more than 12 months and an 11 increase from revenue generated by 56 branch openings since the beginning of 2012 through the one year anniversary of their respective opening dates the increase in revenue was partially offset by the weakening on average of the british pound against the us dollar which decreased revenue by 13 compared to the prior year 

ebitda  as a percentage of revenue ebitda in our european segment increased to 104  for the year ended december 31 2013 from 101  during 2012 in our uk operations improved leverage of our facilities and distribution network to support new branch openings and existing store sales growth resulted in a 11 improvement in ebitda as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior year the improvement in ebitda margin in our uk operations was partially offset by the impact of our sator acquisition which decreased ebitda by 04 as a percentage of revenue we believe that sators negative effect on our ebitda margin will diminish over time as we integrate sator into our european operations which we believe will result in cost savings primarily in purchasing synergies restructuring and acquisition related expenses decreased ebitda by 06 of revenue primarily from our sator acquisition as well as the integration of certain of our other european acquisitions during 2013 we incurred lower expenses related to the remeasurement of contingent payment liabilities which increased ebitda by 03 of revenue compared to the prior year 

2014 outlook 

we estimate that net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ending december 31 2014 excluding the impact of any restructuring and acquisition related expenses and any gains or losses related to acquisitions or divestitures including changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities will be in the range of 400 million to 430 million and 130 to 140 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes liquidity data as of the dates indicated in thousands 



a  includes our revolving credit facility and our receivables securitization facility 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through both internal development and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our credit facilities we utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures with the excess amounts going towards funding acquisitions or paying down outstanding debt as we have pursued acquisitions as part of our growth strategy our cash flows from operations have not always been sufficient to cover our investing activities to fund our acquisitions we have accessed various forms of debt financing including our may 2013 transactions to refinance our existing credit facility and to issue 600 million of senior notes 

as of december 31 2013  we had debt outstanding and additional available sources of financing as follows 

 the sator acquisition was the catalyst for our may 2013 financing transactions had we simply paid for sator with the unamended credit facility the remaining availability under our credit facility would have been approximately 115 million which we judged to be too low for a company our size given that sator is a longterm asset we considered alternative financing options and decided to issue longterm notes to fund this acquisition in connection with the notes transaction we took the opportunity to amend our credit facility by increasing the overall size of the revolver resetting the term loan extending the maturity and adjusting certain covenants we see a number of strategic benefits from this refinancing by issuing the notes we diversified our financing structure by adding a longterm fixed rate instrument and reducing our reliance on the bank market we also believe the interest rate on the notes was favorable although higher than todays floating rate debt the 10year fixed rate of 475 reduces our risk of future interest rate increases which we have seen in the market subsequent to our offering the new structure provides financial flexibility to execute our longterm growth strategy if we see an attractive acquisition opportunity we have the ability to use our revolver to move quickly and have certainty of funding 

 as of december 31 2013  we had 12 billion  available on our credit facilities combined with 150 million  of cash and equivalents at december 31 2013  we had 13 billion  in available liquidity an increase of 885 million  over our available liquidity as of december 31 2012 in january 2014 we increased our credit facility borrowings by 450 million including 370 million borrowed under our senior secured credit facility and 80 million borrowed under the receivables securitization facility primarily to finance our acquisition of keystone specialty completed on january 3 2014 we believe that our current liquidity and cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements although such sources may not be sufficient for future acquisitions depending on their size while we believe that we currently have adequate capacity from time to time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements there can be no assurance that additional funding or refinancing of our credit facility if needed will be available on terms attractive to us or at all furthermore any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at variable rates which depend on the currency and the duration of the borrowing plus an applicable margin rate we hold interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates on our credit agreement borrowings as described in note 5 derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k with the effect of fixing the interest rates on the respective notional amounts after giving effect to these interest rate swap contracts the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding against our credit agreement at december 31 2013  was 305  including the borrowings on our senior notes and receivables securitization program our overall weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 385  at december 31 2013  cash interest payments were 453 million  for the year ended   december 31 2013  which included our first semiannual interest payment of 142 million  related to the senior notes we had outstanding credit agreement borrowings of 6726 million  and 9746 million  at december 31 2013  and december 31 2012 respectively of these amounts 225 million and 319 million were classified as current maturities at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively we have scheduled repayments of 56 million each quarter on the term loan through its maturity in may 2018 but no other significant principal payments on our credit facilities prior to the maturity of the receivables securitization program in september 2015 we currently expect that we will extend the receivables securitization facility when the original three year term expires but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on acceptable terms 

our credit agreement contains customary covenants that provide limitations and conditions on our ability to enter into certain transactions the credit agreement also contains financial and affirmative covenants including limitations on our net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our credit agreement as of december 31 2013  

the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds we normally pay for aftermarket product purchases at the time of shipment or on standard payment terms depending on the manufacturer and the negotiated payment terms our purchases of aftermarket products totaled approximately 17 billion  13 billion  and 8363 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively aftermarket inventory purchases in 2013 include 1985 million  related to our may 2013 acquisition of sator we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles we acquired approximately 281000  262000  and 234000  wholesale salvage vehicles cars and trucks in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively in addition we acquired approximately 513000  416000  and 352000  lower cost self service and crush only vehicles in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

net cash provided by operating activities  totaled 4281 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to 2062 million  in 2012  compared to the prior year our 2013 ebitda increased by 1054 million  due to both acquisition related growth and organic growth while we generated greater pretax income during 2013 compared to the prior year we reduced our cash payments for income taxes to 1109 million  in 2013 from 1465 million  during the prior year because we overpaid taxes in 2012 which we offset against our 2013 estimated tax payments cash payments for incentive compensation were lower during 2013 including 80 million lower bonus payments and a 59 million payment under our longterm incentive plan in the prior year that did not reoccur in 2013 cash outflows for our primary working capital accounts receivables inventory and payables totaled 643 million during 2013 compared to 1230 million during 2012 primarily due to the timing of cash payments on accounts payable cash flows related to our primary working capital accounts can be volatile as the purchases payments and collections can be timed differently from period to period and can be influenced by factors outside of our control however we expect that the net change in these working capital items will generally be a cash outflow as we grow our business each year 

net cash used in investing activities  totaled 5056 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to 3525 million  for the same period of 2012  we invested 4084 million  of cash net of cash acquired in business acquisitions during 2013 including our acquisition of sator for 2728 million compared to 2653 million  for business acquisitions in the comparable prior year in the third quarter of 2013 we entered into an agreement with suncorp group to develop an alternative vehicle products business in australia and new zealand for which our initial investment totaled 91 million  property and equipment purchases were 902 million  in the year ended december 31 2013  compared to 883 million  in the prior year 

net cash provided by financing activities  totaled 1659 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to 1571 million  in 2012  during 2013 we amended our credit facility and issued 600 million in senior notes in 2013 net borrowings were 2271 million compared to 1470 million in 2012 in both periods we used the proceeds from the net borrowings primarily to fund acquisitions in connection with our 2013 financing transactions we paid 169 million in debt issuance costs in march 2013 we made a payment of 339 million 315 million included in financing cash flows and 24 million included in operating cash flows for the 2012 earnout period under the contingent payment agreement related to our 2011 acquisition of ecp cash generated from exercises of stock options provided 154 million  and 177 million  in the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012  respectively the excess tax benefit from sharebased payment arrangements reduced income taxes payable by 183 million  and 157 million  in the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012  respectively 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 2062 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to 2118 million  in 2011  in 2012  our ebitda increased by 925 million  compared to the prior year period due to both acquisition related growth and organic growth the increase in ebitda was partially offset by a 437 million greater cash outflow for accounts payable as we accelerated payments to take advantage of prompt pay discounts resulting in a decrease in days payable outstanding in 2012 compared to 2011 in 2012 we also made 330 million of higher income tax payments compared to the prior year as a result of greater pretax earnings due to higher outstanding debt levels cash payments for interest exceeded the prior year by 77 million prepayments for insurance policies and payroll taxes increased by 73 million over the prior year due to additional insurance policies and the timing of payroll tax payments for our european operations acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011 the year ended december 31 2012  reflected higher bonus payments of 18 million compared to the prior year as well as 59 million of incremental payments under our long term incentive plan 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 3525 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 5716 million for the same period of 2011 we invested 2653 million of cash net of cash acquired in 30 acquisitions and payments for certain of our 2011 acquisitions during 2012 compared to 4869 million for 21 business acquisitions in the comparable prior year period including our acquisition of ecp for 2937 million of cash net of cash acquired property and equipment purchases were 883 million in the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 864 million in the prior year period 

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 1571 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 3114 million in 2011 in 2012 we borrowed a net 1470 million under our credit facilities compared to 3070 million in the prior year our 2012 bank borrowings included 200 million of available term loans under the credit agreement and 80 million under the receivables securitization facility executed in september 2012 the proceeds of which were used to fund acquisitions and pay outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facility our bank borrowings in 2011 were used primarily to finance the acquisition of ecp in october 2011 related to the execution of the 2011 credit agreement we paid 110 million of debt issuance costs during 2011 payments of other obligations which included primarily acquisition related notes payable totaled 231 million in 2012 compared to 45 million during 2011 cash generated from exercises of stock options provided 177 million and 119 million in the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the excess tax benefit from sharebased payment arrangements reduced income taxes payable by 157 million and 80 million in the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

as part of the consideration for certain of our business acquisitions we entered into contingent consideration agreements with the selling shareholders under the terms of the contingent consideration agreements additional payments will be made to the former owners if specified future events occur or conditions are met such as meeting profitability or earnings targets as of december 31 2013  the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities was 557 million  which included a liability for the maximum remaining payment of 497 million £30 million under the contingent payment arrangement for our 2011 ecp acquisition which we expect to pay in the first quarter of 2014 either with cash generated from operations or through draws on our revolving credit facility 

we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of distribution centers processing and sales facilities and warehouses through further integration of our facilities and through selected business acquisitions our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions 

2014 outlook 

we estimate that our capital expenditures for 2014 excluding business acquisitions will be between 110 million and 140 million we expect to use these funds for several major facility expansions improvement of current facilities real estate acquisitions and systems development projects we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 will be approximately 375 million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facility where interest rates are tied to the prime rate libor or cdor therefore we implemented a policy to manage our exposure to variable interest rates on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt instruments through the use of interest rate swap contracts these contracts convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt matching the currency effective dates and maturity dates to specific debt instruments net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swap contracts are included as adjustments to interest expense all of our interest rate swap contracts have been executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy wells fargo bank na bank of america na and rbs citizens na 

as of december 31 2013  we held six interest rate swap contracts representing a total of 420 million of us dollardenominated notional amount debt £50 million of pound sterlingdenominated notional amount debt and cad 25 million of canadian dollardenominated notional amount debt our interest rate swap contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and modify the variable rate nature of that portion of our variable rate debt these swaps have maturity dates ranging from october 2015 through december 2016 in total we had 78 and 64 of our variable rate debt under our credit facility at fixed rates at december 31 2013 and 2012  respectively as of december 31 2013  the fair market value of these swap contracts was a net liability of 85 million  the values of such contracts are subject to changes in interest rates 

at december 31 2013  we had 146 million of variable rate debt that was not hedged and in january 2014 we increased our revolver borrowings by 370 million and our receivables securitization borrowings by 80 million related to our acquisition of keystone specialty including these subsequent borrowings a 100 basis point movement in interest rates would change interest expense by 6 million over the next twelve months to the extent that we have cash investments earning interest a portion of the increase in interest expense resulting from a variable rate change would be mitigated by higher interest income 

the proceeds of our may 2013 senior notes offering were used to finance our eurodenominated acquisition of sator as well as to repay a portion of our pound sterlingdenominated revolver borrowings held by our european operations in connection with these transactions in 2013 we entered into eurodenominated and pound sterlingdenominated intercompany notes which we intend to settle and which may incur transaction gains and losses from fluctuations in the us dollar against these currencies to mitigate these fluctuations we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to sell €1500 million for 1950 million and £700 million for 1058 million the gains or losses from the remeasurement of these contracts are recorded to earnings to offset the remeasurement of the related notes as of december 31 2013  the fair market value of these forward contracts was a liability of 218 million  

additionally we are exposed to currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket products from foreign countries the majority of our foreign inventory purchases are from manufacturers based in taiwan while our transactions with manufacturers based in taiwan are conducted in us dollars changes in the relationship between the us dollar and the taiwan dollar might impact the purchase price of aftermarket products our aftermarket operations in canada which also purchase inventory from taiwan in us dollars are further subject to changes in the relationship between the us dollar and the canadian dollar our aftermarket operations in the uk also source a portion of their inventory from taiwan as well as from other european countries and china resulting in exposure to changes in the relationship of the pound sterling against the euro and the us dollar we hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations for certain of our purchases in our european operations but the notional amount and fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2013  were immaterial we do not currently attempt to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in our north american operations and we may not be able to pass on any price increases to our customers 

foreign currency fluctuations may also impact the financial results we report for the portions of our business that operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar our operations in europe and other countries represented 30  of our revenue during 2013 an increase or decrease in the strength of the us dollar against these currencies by 10 would result in a 3  change in our consolidated revenue and our operating income for the year ended december 31 2013  

other than with respect to our intercompany transactions denominated in euro and pound sterling and a portion of our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in the uk we do not hold derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency risk our net investment in foreign operations is partially hedged by the foreign currency denominated borrowings we use to fund foreign acquisitions additionally we have elected not to hedge the foreign currency risk related to the interest payments on these borrowings as we generate canadian dollar pound sterling and euro cash flows that can be used to fund 

debt payments as of december 31 2013  we had amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility denominated in canadian dollars of cad 1100 million 1036 million pounds sterling of £729 million 1206 million and euros of €70 million 96 million 

we are also exposed to market risk related to price fluctuations in scrap metal and other metals market prices of these metals affect the amount that we pay for our inventory as well as the revenue that we generate from sales of these metals as both our revenue and costs are affected by the price fluctuations we have a natural hedge against the changes however there is typically a lag between the effect on our revenue from metal price fluctuations and inventory cost changes therefore we can experience positive or negative gross margin effects in periods of rising or falling metal prices particularly when such prices move rapidly if market prices were to fall at a greater rate than our vehicle acquisition costs we could experience a decline in gross margin as of december 31 2013  we held shortterm metals forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in metals prices specifically related to our precious metals refining and reclamation business acquired in 2012 the notional amount and fair value of these forward contracts at december 31 2013  were immaterial

 item 1 business 

overview 

lkq corporation lkq or the company provides replacement parts components and systems needed to repair cars and trucks buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers oems which are commonly known as oem products new products produced by companies other than the oems which are sometimes referred to as aftermarket products recycled products originally produced by oems used products that have been refurbished and used products that have been remanufactured 

we distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops including aftermarket collision and mechanical products recycled collision and mechanical products refurbished collision replacement products such as wheels bumper covers and lights and remanufactured engines collectively we refer to our products as alternative parts we are the nations largest provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and a leading provider of alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products with our sales processing and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the united states our wholesale operations also reach most major markets in canada and we are a leading provider of alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products in the united kingdom in addition to our wholesale operations we operate self service retail facilities across the us that sell recycled automotive products we have organized our businesses into three operating segments wholesale—north america wholesale—europe and self service we aggregate our north american operating segments wholesale—north america and self service into one reportable segment resulting in two reportable segments north america and europe see note 15 segment and geographic information  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for financial information by reportable segment and by geographic region 

we obtain the majority of our aftermarket inventory from automotive parts manufacturers and distributors based in the us taiwan europe and china we procure recycled automotive products mainly by purchasing salvage vehicles typically severely damaged by collisions and primarily sold at salvage auctions or pools and then dismantling and inventorying the parts the refurbished and remanufactured products that we sell such as wheels bumper covers lights and engines originate from the salvage vehicles bought at auctions and from parts received in trade from customers purchasing replacement products from us 

the majority of our products and services are sold to collision repair shops also known as body shops and mechanical repair shops we indirectly rely on insurance companies which ultimately pay for the majority of collision repairs of insured vehicles to help drive demand insurance companies tend to exert significant influence in the vehicle repair decision because of their importance to the process we have formed relationships with certain insurance companies in north america for which we are designated a preferred products supplier we are attempting to establish similar relationships with insurance companies in europe 

we provide customers with a value proposition that includes high quality products at lower cost than new oem products extensive product availability due to our expansive distribution network responsive service and quick delivery the breadth of our alternative parts offerings allows us to serve as a onestop solution for our customers looking for the most cost effective way to provide quality repairs 

we strive to be environmentally responsible our recycled automotive products provide an alternative to the manufacture of new products which would require the expenditure of significantly more resources and energy and would generate a substantial amount of additional pollution in addition we save landfill space because the parts that we recycle would otherwise be discarded we also collect materials such as metals plastics fuel and motor oil from the salvage vehicles that we procure and use them in our operations or sell them to other users 

history 

since our formation in 1998 we have grown through internal development and over 150 acquisitions today lkq is the only supplier of alternative parts for the automotive collision and mechanical repair industry with a network and presence serving most major markets in the us and canada we are also the largest supplier of automotive aftermarket products reaching most major markets in the uk 

initially formed through the combination of a number of wholesale recycled products businesses located in florida michigan ohio and wisconsin lkq grew to be a leading source for recycled automotive collision and mechanical products we subsequently expanded through acquisitions of aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured product suppliers and manufacturers and also expanded into the self service retail business the most significant increase to our business was through the acquisition of keystone automotive industries inc in october 2007 which at the time of acquisition was the leading domestic distributor of aftermarket products including collision replacement products paint products refurbished steel bumpers bumper covers and alloy wheels 

in october 2011 we expanded our operations into the european automotive aftermarket business through our acquisition of euro car parts holdings limited ecp as of december 31 2012 ecp operated out of 130 branches supported by a national distribution center and nine regional hubs from which multiple deliveries are made each day ecps product offerings are primarily focused on automotive aftermarket mechanical products many of which are sourced from the same suppliers that provide products to the oems the expansion of our geographic presence beyond north america into the european market offers an opportunity to us as that market has historically had a low penetration of alternative collision parts 

in 2012 we made 30  acquisitions in north america including 22  wholesale businesses and eight  self service retail operations these acquisitions enabled us to expand our geographic presence and enter new markets additionally two of our acquisitions were completed with a goal of improving the recovery from scrap and other metals harvested from the vehicles we purchase a precious metals refining and reclamation business which we acquired with the goal of improving the profitability of the precious metals we extract from our recycled vehicle parts and a scrap metal shredder which we expect will improve the profitability of the scrap metals recovered from the vehicle hulks in certain of our recycled product operations 

subsequent to december 31 2012 we completed the acquisition of an aftermarket product distributor in the uk and a paint distribution business in canada we expect to make additional strategic acquisitions in 2013 in domestic and international markets as we continue to build an integrated distribution network offering a broad range of alternative parts 

strategy 

we are focused on creating economic value for our stockholders by enhancing our position as a leading source for alternative collision and mechanical repair products and by expanding into other product lines and businesses that may benefit from our operating strengths we believe a supply network with a broad inventory of quality alternative collision and mechanical repair products high fulfillment rates and superior customer service will provide us with a competitive advantage other than oems the competition in the markets that we serve is extremely fragmented and the supply of products tends to be localized often leading to low fulfillment rates particularly with recycled products in north america the distribution channels for aftermarket and refurbished products have historically been distinct and separate from those for recycled and remanufactured products despite serving the same customer segment we provide value to our customers by bringing these two channels together to provide a broader product offering to execute our strategy we are expanding our network of dismantling plants and warehouses in major metropolitan areas and employing a distribution system that allows for order fulfillment from regional warehouses located across the us and canada by increasing local inventory levels and expanding our network to provide timely access to a greater range of parts we have increased fulfillment rates beyond the levels that we believe most of our competitors realize particularly for recycled products we believe opportunities exist beyond our north american operations to introduce the benefits of an integrated distribution network that supplies alternative parts 

sources of high quality reliable alternatives to oem products are important to insurance companies and to our direct customers as they seek to control repair costs lower parts costs and quicker completion of orders save money and reduce cycle times in order to execute this strategy and build on our progress thus far we will continue to seek to expand into new markets and to improve penetration both organically and through acquisitions in targeted markets 

national network in place 

lkq has invested significant capital to develop a network of alternative parts facilities across the us and canada the difficulty and time required to obtain proper zoning as well as dismantling and other environmental permits necessary to operate newlysited recycled product facilities would make establishing a new network of locations a challenge for a competitor in addition there are difficulties associated with recruiting and hiring an experienced management team that has strong industry knowledge 

we believe there are growth opportunities in new primary and secondary markets in the us canada and europe we intend to expand our market coverage through a combination of internal development and acquisitions in new regions and adjacent markets our broad network allows us to initially enter new adjacent markets by establishing local redistribution facilities avoiding the need for significant upfront capital outlays to establish local dismantling capabilities and inventories we also believe opportunities exist to leverage our national distribution network to expand into complementary product lines as we have done with our remanufactured engines and paint products 

strong business relationships 

we have developed business relationships with automobile insurance companies collision and mechanical repair shops suppliers and other industry participants we believe that insurance companies as payers for many repairs take active roles in the selection of alternative replacement products for vehicle repairs in order to minimize the repair portion of the claims costs and reduce cycle time on behalf of certain insurance companies we provide a review of vehicle repair estimates so they may assess the opportunity to increase usage of alternative products in the repair process thereby reducing their costs our employees also provide quotes for our products to assist several insurance companies with their estimate and settlement 

processes we also work with insurance companies and vehicle manufacturers to procure salvage vehicles directly from them on a selected basis which provides us with an additional source of supply and offers lower transaction costs to sellers of low value salvage vehicles we believe we are positioned to take advantage of the increasing importance these industry participants have in the repair process and will continue to look for ways to enhance our relationships with them 

we provide quality assurance programs that offer additional product support to automobile insurance companies these product support programs identify specific subsets of aftermarket products by vendor and product type that can be used in the repair of vehicles that these companies insure the programs typically offer aftermarket products that have been produced by manufacturers certified by a third party testing lab we may provide additional validation of the quality of the products beyond our standard warranties and identification details that make the products traceable back to a manufacturers specific production run 

to strengthen our relationship with collision shops we developed keyless a program that enables collision repair shops to link their estimating systems with our aftermarket and recycled inventory it is compatible with all of the major estimating systems and in 2012 certain of the estimating systems began using technologies that are fully integrated with our inventory system these solutions provide realtime inventory availability and encourage the use of alternative products by indicating to the collision shop the availability of applicable alternative products at the time of the estimate it also provides demand information to our purchasing department and offers sales leads for our sales representatives 

technology driven business processes 

we focus on technology development as a way to support our competitive advantage we believe that we can more cost effectively leverage our data to make better business decisions than our smaller competitors we continue to develop our technology to better manage and analyze our inventory assist our salespeople with uptodate pricing and availability of our products and further enhance our inventory procurement process for example our bidding specialists responsible for procuring vehicles are equipped with handheld computing devices that compare the vehicles at the salvage auctions to our current inventory historical demand and recent average prices to arrive at an estimated maximum bid this bidding system reduces the likelihood of purchasing unneeded parts that might result in obsolete inventory 

we deploy inventory management systems at our facilities that are similar to those used by leading distribution companies we make extensive use of bar code technology and wireless data transmission to track parts from the time a vehicle or product arrives at a facility to its placement on a truck for delivery to the customer with this realtime information the sales representatives in our north american wholesale operations can quickly and reliably determine the availability of our inventory to better address our wholesale customers needs in the uk we use an integrated inventory management system that provides uptotheminute information on available stock by location to ensure availability of highdemand inventory based on daily sales activity the system directs the needed overnight deliveries to replenish stock levels among the national distribution center hubs and branch locations to ensure product availability to meet local customer demand 

demand driven procurement 

we believe efficient procurement of aftermarket products and salvage vehicles is critical to the growth of the operating results and cash flow of our business we use information systems and proprietary methodologies to help us identify high demand aftermarket and recycled products our aftermarket inventory systems track products sold and sales lost due to a lack of inventory and make purchase recommendations based on this information the inventory systems also recommend purchases and transfers based on the extent and location of demand as well as other replenishment factors our buying team reviews the recommendations and places orders accordingly when we procure aftermarket products or refurbish collision replacement products such as wheels bumper covers and lights we focus on products that are in the most demand by the insured repair market our most popular aftermarket products are collision replacement products such as hoods and fenders bumper covers head lamps and tail lamps because lead times may take 40 days or more on imported products sales volume and instock inventory are important factors in the procurement process 

our information systems prioritize and recommend bid prices for the salvage vehicles we evaluate for purchase our processes and systems help to identify with a high degree of accuracy the value of the parts that can be recycled on a salvage vehicle and recommend a maximum purchase price to achieve our target profitability from the resale of the recycled products we also use historical sales records of vehicles by model and year to estimate the demand for our products combining this information with proprietary data that aggregate customer requests for products we are able to source aftermarket products and salvage vehicles at prices that we believe will allow us to sell products profitably 

high fulfillment rates 

we manage local inventory levels to improve delivery time and maximize customer service improving local order fulfillment rates reduces transfer costs and delivery times and improves customer satisfaction our ability to share inventory on a regional basis increases the availability of replacement products and also helps us to fill a higher percentage of our customers 

requests we have developed regional trading zones within which we make our inventory available to our local facilities mostly via overnight product transfers we manage our purchasing and recycled product inventory on a regional basis to enhance the availability of the products that we believe will be in the highest demand within each region we believe that our fulfillment rates are generally higher than the industry average which distinguishes us from our competition 

broad product offering 

the breadth and depth of our inventory reinforces lkqs ability to provide a onestop solution for our customers alternative vehicle replacement product needs customers place a high value on the availability of a broad range of vehicle replacement products we are able to provide the collision and mechanical repair industry with premium products at costs typically 20 to 50 below new oem replacement products the availability of alternative products means that automobiles can be repaired at lower costs and contributes to cars being repaired rather than designated as total losses by insurance companies in fact many insurance companies in north america will not authorize the use of higher cost new oem replacement products if alternative products are available our ability to supply these products gives insurance companies the confidence to designate lkq as a preferred supplier for their repair shops with our distribution network that reaches the major markets in the us and canada combined with our extensive range of products we believe we are the only supplier that is able to support the insurance industry in this manner we believe we will be positioned to provide similar services to the insurance industry in the uk as we expand our collision product offerings and continue to build the national distribution network there 

our aftermarket and refurbished product lines are particularly broad with more than 107000 skus sold in north america in 2012 in order to address the multiple needs of our customers we offer our platinum plus line of high quality aftermarket products with lifetime warranties and our value line of aftermarket products when cost is the main factor for vehicle repairs our uk operations also offer a broad range of products with more than 112000 individual skus sold in 2012 

certain of our products are certified by independent organizations such as the certified automotive parts association capa and nsf international nsf capa and nsf are associations that evaluate the functional equivalence of aftermarket collision replacement products to oem collision replacement products members of capa and nsf include insurance companies product distributors including lkq collision repair shops and consumers capa and nsf develop engineering specifications for aftermarket collision replacement products based upon examinations of oem products certify the factories manufacturing processes and quality control procedures used by independent manufacturers and certify the materials fit and finish of specific aftermarket collision replacement products 

in 2011 lkq became the first automotive parts distributor to become certified under the nsf international automotive parts distributor certification program which addresses the needs of collision repair shops and insurers by maintaining quality management systems to address part traceability service and quality this certification program complements the existing parts certification program with nsf under which lkq has a broad range of certified automotive collision replacement parts many major insurance companies have adopted policies recommending or requiring the use of products certified by capa or nsf a number of capa and nsf certified products are also marketed under the platinum plus brand 

one call away 

to execute our strategy of offering a broad inventory with high fulfillment rates we offer our customers the choice of aftermarket or recycled products for many parts we also offer refurbished or remanufactured product options if for example a customer has a damaged bumper we may offer that customer the choice of a recycled bumper a new aftermarket bumper or a refurbished bumper because recycled products are in limited supply our ability to offer additional alternative product options increases our fulfillment rates and customer satisfaction historically the distribution channels for aftermarket and refurbished products have been separate from those for recycled and remanufactured products however we are combining these channels through the sharing of warehousing inventory sales and distribution systems so that our repair shop customers need only one source of supply for their alternative repair products 

north america segment 

wholesale automotive products 

our wholesale automobile product operations in north america are organized by geographic regions serving the us and canada that sell all four product types to collision and mechanical automobile repair businesses beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012 we aligned the reporting structure of our heavyduty truck salvage yards with the geographic reporting structure of our wholesale operations under which each of our wholesale regions incorporated the heavyduty truck locations into the respective geographic boundaries as a result the heavyduty truck yards that composed a separate operating segment prior to 2012 are included within the wholesale  north america operating segment by aligning the heavyduty truck yards 

with our wholesale facilities that offer alternative parts for automobiles and light and mediumduty trucks the heavyduty truck operations will be able to leverage the distribution network of our wholesale operations and take advantage of crossselling opportunities as of december 31 2012 our north american wholesale operations conducted business from more than 320 facilities 

as we have combined the distribution channels for our alternative parts offerings we also leverage our facility and warehouse costs and improve local product availability by locating multiple product operations together our aftermarket product operations may include a combination of sales warehousing and distribution and in many cases will be colocated with our refurbishing operations our recycled product operations which we may also colocate with aftermarket warehouses typically have processing sales distribution and administrative operations on site indoor and outdoor storage areas and include a large warehouse with multiple bays to dismantle vehicles our engine remanufacturing operations are conducted primarily at our facility in mexico with sales warehousing and distribution in the us 

wholesale aftermarket products 

our 2012 sales included more than 89000 skus of aftermarket automotive products excluding refurbished products for the most common models of domestic and foreign automobiles and light trucks primarily for the repair of vehicles three to seven years old our principal aftermarket product types consist of those most frequently damaged in collisions including automotive body panels bumper covers and lights in recent years our expansion in complementary product types such as paint and cooling products contributed to the increase in our available products and has allowed us to better meet our customers repair needs 

platinum plus is our exclusive product line offered in the keystone brand of aftermarket products the platinum plus products are held to high quality standards and tested by quality assurance teams we provide a warranty for as long as a consumer owns the vehicle on which the product was installed many of our platinum plus products are used for repairs that are ultimately paid for by insurance companies and are part of our quality assurance programs 

we have also developed a product line called value line for more value conscious often selfpay consumers our value line products offer quality products at reasonable prices providing additional choices for repairs or rebuilding of vehicles the value line product line includes most product categories 

we distribute paint and other materials used in repairing damaged vehicles including sandpaper abrasives masking products and plastic filler the paint and other materials distributed by us are purchased from numerous suppliers in the us and canada certain of these products are distributed under the brand keystone 

procurement of inventory 

the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from independent manufacturers and distributors located primarily in the us and taiwan in 2012 approximately 37 of our aftermarket purchases were made from our top four vendors with our largest vendor providing approximately 12 of our inventory we believe we are one of the largest customers of each of these suppliers outside of this group no other supplier provided more than 5 of our supply of aftermarket products we purchased approximately 42 of our aftermarket products directly from manufacturers in taiwan and other asian countries approximately 58 of our aftermarket products were purchased from vendors located in the us and canada however we believe the majority of these products were manufactured in taiwan mexico or other foreign countries 

we benefit from an automated procurement system for aftermarket goods that makes order and inventory transfer recommendations using product sales and data for lost sales due to stockouts buyers review the systems recommendations and then place purchase orders or arrange for a redistribution of inventory to areas of higher demand typically six months after the products are introduced the automated system has sufficient data to make order recommendations for new products we use vehicle volume and registrations by state to influence what new products should be ordered and where the stock should be located 

we have business arrangements with manufacturers to produce our platinum plus products these agreements automatically renew for additional 12 month periods unless written notice is given while we compete with other distributors for production capacity we believe that our sources of supply and our relationships with our suppliers are satisfactory 

we usually receive orders within ten days from domestic suppliers foreign orders typically are shipped in sea containers directly to 94 of our aftermarket locations and are received within 40 to 60 days from the date ordered beginning in 2012 we operate an aftermarket parts warehouse in taiwan that aggregates inventory from certain of our vendors for shipment to our north american locations we have 24 regional hubs and three distribution centers which act as sources for our other noncontainerdirect aftermarket warehouse locations and serve as redistribution centers for our operations this structure is designed to maximize our fulfillment rates as smaller branches can have a high fillrate of next day availability 

wholesale recycled products 

our most popular recycled products include engines transmissions and axle assemblies door assemblies sheet metal products such as trunk lids fenders and hoods head and tail lamp assemblies and bumper assemblies some insurance companies mandate that the recycled products must be of the same model year or newer as the vehicle being repaired as a result the majority of the products we sell are from vehicles not more than ten years of age we have adopted the industrys grading system based on the condition of the product and factor product grades into our pricing decisions unlike aftermarket products that are individually boxed recycled products are most frequently sold as subassemblies or multiple preassembled parts installing recycled products often means that collision shops not only save on product cost but because several products may come preassembled the shops are also able to reduce labor costs 

procurement of inventory 

we procure recycled products for our wholesale operations by acquiring damaged or totaled vehicles vehicles that have been declared total losses typically are sold at regional salvage auctions throughout the us and canada salvage auctions charge fees both to the suppliers of vehicles primarily insurance companies and to the purchasers such as lkq additionally we typically pay third parties fees to tow the vehicles from the auction to our facilities 

the availability of the salvage vehicles we procure for our late model recycled product operations may be impacted by a variety factors including the production level of new vehicles which provides the source from which salvage vehicles ultimately come and the portion of damaged vehicles declared total losses over the past several years the frequency with which vehicles are declared total losses has increased as a result¸ we believe of the rise in repair costs relative to vehicle replacement cost in 2000 approximately 9 of accident claims resulted in a total loss by 2012 this percentage increased to almost 14 while the percentage of vehicles declared as total losses has increased the supply of late model vehicles at auction has declined due to fewer cars produced in 2008 and 2009 new vehicle sales began to increase again in 2010 and industry reports project that new car sales will continue to grow over the next several years these trends should increase the volume of salvage vehicles at auction 

in 2012 lkq acquired 254000  salvage vehicles for our wholesale recycled product operations with 97 purchased at salvage auctions prior to the scheduled auction date our salvage buyers may preview the auctions online to investigate the vehicles to be sold and determine our interest in buying them they obtain key information such as the model and mileage and perform visual damage assessments to determine which parts on the targeted vehicles are recyclable with the data from this preview we deploy a bidding system that performs a valuation calculation for each vehicle in order to recommend a maximum bid price the calculation incorporates demand for a vehicles recyclable parts current inventory levels average selling prices auction costs projected margins and instances of outofstock using this disciplined supply and demand procurement approach we place bids on the targeted vehicles in most cases we attend auctions in person although some of our purchasing is done through an online auction system 

we acquired 3 of the salvage vehicles we purchased for wholesale parts in 2012 directly from insurance companies vehicle manufacturers and other direct sellers these arrangements eliminate the fees charged to the buyers and sellers by the salvage auction often providing inventory with a lower initial expenditure of capital direct purchase agreements while usually beneficial have limited applicability to our procurement because vehicle auctions provide us with the flexibility to focus on sought after vehicles based on our bidding algorithms 

vehicle processing 

vehicle processing for our wholesale recycled operations involves dismantling a salvage vehicle into recycled products that are ready for sale when a salvage vehicle arrives at one of our facilities an inventory specialist identifies catalogs and schedules the vehicle for dismantling prior to dismantling we remove from each vehicle its fluids freon and parts containing hazardous substances or precious metals such as catalytic converters the extracted fluids are stored in bulk and subsequently sold to recyclers in the case of gasoline the fuel retrieved is primarily used to power our delivery vehicles a small portion of the recycled motor oil we collect is used at certain of our plants that have highefficiency oil burning furnaces the balance is sold to motor oil recyclers 

when ready for dismantling each vehicle will have an inventory report that indicates to the dismantler which parts should be removed and placed in a warehouse for future sales to customers which parts should be collected in bulk for our refurbishing and remanufacturing operations or for sale to parts remanufacturers and which parts have value but should remain on the vehicle until sold 

products that are placed directly on our shelves are typically higher sales volume items such as engines transmissions door assemblies head and tail lamp assemblies bumper covers trunk lids and fenders many of the recycled products we sell are subassemblies of multiple parts including quarter panels and front end assemblies the subassemblies are cut from the vehicle bodies usually using specific parameters provided by the repair shop at the time of sale 

if there is strong demand for products that are currently at high stock levels in our warehouses we may choose to hold the vehicle for further dismantling at some future date when we are more likely to have a need for the parts the holding period for partially dismantled car bodies will depend on the space available at the site once all of the parts of value have been removed the remaining vehicle frame is crushed and sold to scrap processors 

prior to placement on our warehouse shelves each inventory item is given a unique bar code tag for identification and entered into our inventory tracking system we utilize bar coding systems and wireless transmission to keep track of inventory from the time a product is removed and inventoried to the time it is sold and put on a truck for delivery 

refurbished and remanufactured products 

as of december 31 2012 we operated 27 plastic bumper and bumper cover refurbishing plants a chrome bumper plating plant 13 wheel refurbishing plants three light refurbishing plants and four engine remanufacturing facilities 

when identifying the products that we refurbish or remanufacture we focus on products that have high demand the majority of our refurbished and remanufactured products are processed from cores obtained from salvage vehicles purchased by our recycled operations and damaged cores collected by our route delivery drivers from vehicles under repair by our customers these products are accumulated from our wholesale operations at our core sorting facilities and are then either sent to our refurbishing or remanufacturing facilities or sold in bulk to other mechanical remanufacturers our sales capacity for these products is limited by the availability of cores to refurbish 

in addition to the products we refurbish or remanufacture inhouse we sell some remanufactured mechanical products such as engines and transmissions acquired from other mechanical remanufacturers most of our refurbished and remanufactured products are sold through our wholesale distribution channels the balance is sold to retail automotive stores wholesale distributors and via internet sales 

heavyduty truck products 

lkq started its heavyduty recycled truck product operations in 2008 with the acquisition of a recycler based in houston texas as of december 31 2012 we had a total of 27 facilities in the us and canada we began our recycled truck operations with a belief that a network offering alternative repair products for heavyduty trucks would provide similar opportunities as our wholesale product distribution network for automobiles and light and mediumduty trucks by including our heavyduty truck yards in the geographic regions of our wholesale business beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012 we expect to leverage the established distribution network of our wholesale operations for the benefit of these heavyduty truck operations 

our inventory is comprised of used heavy and mediumduty trucks usually at least five years old which are purchased at salvage and truck auctions or directly from insurance companies or large fleet operators during 2012 we purchased approximately 8200  vehicles depending on the condition of the vehicles they may be dismantled for parts or resold as running vehicles if certain mechanical parts are damaged such as transmissions we may remanufacture them and offer them to our customers the vehicles that are acquired for resale are typically special purpose or vocational use trucks such as those used for garbage pickup or cement delivery if requested by the sellers of the vehicles we provide an assurance that the vehicles will be sold to foreign buyers and exported to countries for use outside of the us or to domestic buyers after the vehicles have been reconditioned and modified for use other than their original purpose 

scrap and other materials 

our wholesale recycled product operations generate scrap metal and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that have been dismantled for recycled products and crush only end of life vehicles acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site in other cases we will hire mobile crushing equipment to crush the vehicles before they are transported to shredders and scrap metal processors damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products including wheels beginning in 2012 with our acquisition of a precious metals refining and reclamation business we also extract and sell the precious metals contained in certain of our salvage parts such as catalytic converters 

customers 

we sell our products to wholesale customers that include collision and mechanical repair shops and new and used car dealerships as well as to retail customers customers of our heavyduty truck products may also include owneroperators local cartage companies or exporters we also generate a portion of our revenue from scrap sales to metal recyclers no single customer accounted for 2 or more of our revenue in 2012 

repair shops and others 

we sell the majority of our wholesale products to collision and mechanical repair shops industry reports estimate there were approximately 40000 collision repair shops including those owned by new car dealerships in the us in 2011 the same reports estimate there were approximately 77000 general including mechanical repair garages excluding new car dealership service departments in the us in 2011 the majority of these customers tend to be individuallyowned small businesses although the number of independent and dealeroperated collision repair facilities has declined 18 since 2006 as regional or national multiple location operators have increased their geographic presence through acquisitions primarily in existing markets we also sell our products to car rental companies and fleet management groups 

insurance companies 

automobile insurance companies wield significant influence on the demand for our products while insurance companies do not pay for our products directly they ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount as a result insurance companies often influence the types of products used in a repair 

our presence in most major markets in the us and canada gives us a distinctive ability to benefit the major automobile insurance companies insurance companies generally operate at a national or regional level the use of our products provides a direct benefit to these companies by lowering the cost of repairs decreasing the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and providing a replacement product that is of high quality and comparable performance to the part replaced 

we assist insurance companies by providing high quality aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured products to collision repair shops especially to repair shops that are part of an insurance companys direct repair program drp network a repair shop participating in a drp is referred potential work from the insurance company in exchange for providing assurances to the insurance company of quality timeliness and cost industry reports indicate that over half of claims paid for by the top insurance companies in 2012 were paid through a drp compared to just over 40 in 2008 to meet the needs of the drps professional repairers have been required to become fluent in claims handling our keyless system assists these repairers by indicating the availability of alternative products as replacements for damaged oem products this data also helps insurance companies monitor the body shops compliance with its drp product guidelines that might for instance stipulate the use of the lowest cost products that meet quality specifications in addition in some markets insurance companies are able to dispose of low value total loss vehicles directly to us so they can save the transaction fees associated with selling these vehicles through salvage auctions 

sales and marketing 

in the case of repairs paid for as a result of insurance claims which industry publications estimate are approximately 85 of all repairs insurance companies give collision repair shops directives as to what type of replacement products are eligible for reimbursement typically insurance carriers have established a hierarchy or decision tree prioritizing the types of products to be used for repairs as an example a protocol may require recycled products if available if recycled products are not available then refurbished products and if recycled or refurbished products are not available aftermarket products if none of these alternative product types is available the shop may then use new oem replacement products as a body shop looks for products for a repair the sourcing of products typically begins with a call to one of our recycled operations or one of our competitors our recycled sales personnel are encouraged to capture the sale as a onestop shop and if recycled products are out of stock to fill orders from our refurbished or aftermarket product inventory to support these efforts we have provided our sales staff with access to both recycled and aftermarket sales systems and we have developed sales incentive programs that encourage cross selling throughout our wholesale operations 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 2000 fulltime sales staff in our north american wholesale operating segment the full time sales personnel are located at sales desks at our facilities or at one of the regional call centers we operate we deploy a call routing system that redirects overflow calls to alternative call centers typically located within the same region we also operate two other call centers one to support national accounts and the other to support insurance adjusters needs and questions our sales personnel are encouraged to initiate outbound calls in addition to the inbound calls they handle our sales staff can use customer estimates from our keyless estimating system to generate sales leads for both aftermarket and recycled products 

we are continually reviewing and revising the pricing of wholesale products our pricing specialists consider factors such as recent demand levels inventory quantity on hand and turnover rates new oem product prices and local competitive pricing with the goal of optimizing revenue we set list prices and then sell items at a discount to list with the discount typically based on each customers purchasing volume we may adjust prices during the year in response to material price changes of new oem replacement products 

we believe our commitment to stock inventory in local warehouses supplemented by the inventory sharing system within our regional trading zones improves our ability to meet our customers requirements more frequently than our competitors and gives us a competitive advantage 

distribution 

we have a distribution network of over 320 wholesale plants and warehouses across the us and canada of which 52 function as large hub or cross dock facilities our network of facilities allows us to develop and maintain our relationships with local repair shops while providing a level of service that is made possible by our nationwide presence our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries as required by our customers using drivers who routinely deliver to the same customers our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network 

we have developed an internal distribution network to allow our sales representatives to sell our products within regional trading zones thus improving our ability to fulfill customer requests and accelerating inventory turnover each weekday we operate over 290 transfer runs between our cross dock facilities and our plants and warehouses within our regional trading zones to redistribute our alternative products for delivery on the next day in addition we have approximately 2700 local delivery routes serving our customers each weekday 

each sale results in the generation of a work order at the location housing the specific product a dispatcher is then responsible for ensuring fulfillment accuracy printing the final invoice and including the product on the appropriate truck route for delivery to the customer in markets where we offer more than one alternative product type we have begun to integrate the delivery of multiple product types on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs and improve customer service we operate a delivery fleet of mediumsized trucks and smaller trucks and vans over time our delivery vehicles will become more consistent as we reconfigure the fleet to include vehicles that can carry all four product types 

competition 

we consider all suppliers of vehicle collision and mechanical products to be competitors including aftermarket suppliers recycling businesses refurbishing operations parts remanufacturers oems and internetbased suppliers we believe the principal areas of differentiation in our industry include availability of inventory pricing product quality and service 

the aftermarket product distribution business is highly fragmented and our competitors other than oems are generally independently owned distributors with one to three distribution centers similarly we compete with domestic vehicle product recyclers most of which are singleunit operators in some markets smaller competitors have organized affiliations to share marketing and distribution resources including internet sites we compete with alternative parts distributors on the basis of our nationwide distribution system our product lines and inventory availability customer service our relationships with insurance companies and to a lesser extent price we do not consider retail chains that focus on the doityourself market to be our direct competitors since many of our wholesale product sales are paid for by insurance companies rather than the end user 

manufacturers of new original equipment products sell the majority of automobile replacement products we believe however that as the insurance and repair industries continue to recognize the advantages of aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured products the alternatives to new oem replacement products will account for a larger percentage of total vehicle replacement product sales since 2008 alternative parts usage has increased from approximately 32 to 37 of the collision replacement product market we compete with oems on the basis of price service and product quality 

self service retail products 

our self service retail operations sell parts from older cars and lightduty trucks directly to consumers in addition to revenue from the sale of parts core and scrap we charge a nominal admission fee to access the property our self service facilities typically consist of a fenced or enclosed area of several acres with vehicles stored outdoors and a retail building through which customers are able to access the yard in 2012 we began rebranding most of our self service locations under the name lkq pick your part as of december 31 2012 we conducted our self service operations from 62 facilities in north america 

inventory 

we acquire inventory for our self service retail product operations from a variety of sources including but not limited to towing companies auctions the general public insurance carriers municipality sales and charitable organizations we typically procure salvage vehicles that are more than seven model years old for our self service retail product operations these vehicles are generally older and of lower quality than the salvage vehicles we purchase for our wholesale recycled product operations beginning in 2011 a reduction in the supply of these vehicles has contributed to increased car costs which is partially a result of the 2009 cash for clunkers program that removed many vehicles from supply earlier in their life cycle in 2012 we purchased approximately 416000  lower cost self service and crush only vehicles 

vehicles are delivered to our locations by the seller or we arrange for transportation once on our property minimal labor is required to process the vehicle other than removing the fluids freon catalytic converters and hazardous materials vehicles are then placed in the yard for customers to remove parts the vehicle inventory is usually organized according to domestic and import cars further organized by make passenger vans and trucks in our self service business availability of a specific part will depend on which vehicles are currently at the site and to what extent parts may have been previously sold we usually keep a vehicle at our facility for 30 to 75 days generally depending on the capacity of the yard before it is crushed and sold to scrap metal processors by maintaining a relatively short turnover period we ensure that our inventory is continually updated with different car options or removed from the yard when the saleable parts are depleted 

scrap and other materials 

our self service auto recycling operations generate scrap metal alloys and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that we no longer make available to the public and crush only vehicles acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site with our acquisition of a scrap metal shredder in florida in 2012 we will begin shredding certain vehicle hulks ourselves in 2013 by shredding our hulks rather than selling them to a recycler we expect to improve the recovery of the scrap metals contained in the vehicle hulks generated by local salvage operations 

customers 

the customers of our self service yards are frequently doityourself mechanics small independent repair shops servicing older vehicles and auto rebuilders the scrap from the vehicle hulks when not processed by us is sold to recyclers with whom we may also compete when procuring salvage vehicles for our operations 

sales and marketing 

we list part prices for automobiles and lightduty trucks on regularly updated price sheets with prices varying by part type but not by make or model for instance four cylinder engines are priced the same regardless of vehicle make model age or condition while we do not consider retail automotive chains to be our direct competitors as their product offerings are focused on maintenance products and mechanical parts we may reference their prices on certain parts as a benchmark to ensure our prices remain competitive 

competition 

there are competitors operating self service businesses in all of the markets in which we operate in some markets there are numerous competitors often operating in close proximity to our operations we try to differentiate our business by the quality of the inventory and the size and cleanliness of the property 

europe segment 

wholesale auto products 

our european wholesale operating segment was formed in the fourth quarter of 2011 with our acquisition of ecp we continued to expand our branch network in 2012 by opening 41 new locations in the uk including an extension to the national distribution center this extension houses additional product lines including certain collision repair products such as body panels and bumpers some of which are marketed under the platinum plus brand we use in north america as of december 31 2012 we operated 130 branch locations supported by a national distribution center and nine regional hubs which allows us to reach most major markets within the uk with its national distribution system and it infrastructure we believe ecp will serve as a platform to expand into complementary products to increase market penetration in this region as well as to further develop a collision repair parts business similar to our north american wholesale operations 

inventory 

in 2012 we sold more than 112000 skus of aftermarket products primarily composed of mechanical aftermarket parts for the repair of vehicles three to 15 years old our top selling products include electrical products such as spark plugs and ignition coils brake pads and sensors steering and suspension parts and clutches and related parts in 2012 our top 10 suppliers represented 32 of our inventory purchases with our top supplier representing approximately 7 of our purchases no suppliers outside of our top ten suppliers provided more than 3 of our annual purchases the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from vendors located primarily in the uk and other european countries in 2012 we purchased 62 of our aftermarket products from companies in the uk and 23 of our products from other european countries most of the products we purchase in the uk are sourced from businesses headquartered in other european countries approximately 15 of our products were procured directly from vendors located primarily in china or taiwan some of which also supply collision parts for our wholesale  north america operations 

we provide value to our customers by offering aftermarket products that in many cases are sourced from the same suppliers used by oems by working directly with the manufacturers we are able to eliminate intermediate steps in the parts supply chain to offer the same products for a lower price compared to oems for many of our products we also offer lowercost lines for our customers that are more cost conscious 

customers 

we sell the majority of our products to over 38000 professional repairers including independent mechanical repair shops and collision repair shops in addition to our sales to repair shops we generate a portion of our revenue through sales to retail customers from our branch stores which have historically represented less than 20 of our revenue no single customer accounted for more than 2 of our revenue in 2012 

sales and marketing 

to place an order our customers will generally call a sales representative at the nearest branch using an electronic automotive exchange and our integrated it platform displaying inventory availability our sales representatives can locate for our customers the appropriate replacement part we set list prices for our products and then apply a discount off of list primarily depending on each customers purchasing volume in 2012 we launched a businesstobusiness website with certain of our customers to enable them to place product orders online through a customized interface that includes detailed parts specifications customerspecific pricing local branch availability and account information we believe this customer interface will result in fewer parts returns by improving order accuracy and will also reduce the time required by parts specialists to advise customers whether placed via a phone order or online customer orders are filled from the local branch or routed to another location as necessary to fill the order 

similar to our north american wholesale operations insurance companies significantly influence the purchasing decisions for collision products in the uk we believe the historically low alternative collision parts usage percentage which is currently less than 10 provides an opportunity for us in this market particularly as insurance companies look to lower their costs as a result we are attempting to establish business relationships with insurance companies and implement insurerbased marketing models to bring visibility to the cost savings that can be achieved through the use of alternative parts as we continue to grow our collision parts offerings over time in this market we believe we will be wellpositioned to serve as a lowercost alternative for insured repairs in the uk 

distribution 

we employ a central stock replenishment system supported by our integrated it platform to monitor historical demand lost sales and orders using this information we are better able to appropriately stock our branches to meet customer requests in addition to stocking our branches based on local inventory demand beginning in 2012 all branch locations carry approximately 3500 of the top selling skus to meet the demand of our national customers our typical branch location holds between 10 and 20 of our available skus with nightly replenishment from our national distribution center and other distribution hubs all of our branches can deliver certain instock parts within one hour in the event that a branch does not have a requested part the part is supplied by either a hub or the national distribution center within 24 hours we deliver parts to our customers on our vans or third party motorcycles with 41000 daily deliveries or otherwise by third party carriers 

competition 

we view all suppliers of replacement repair products as our competitors including other alternative parts suppliers and oems and their dealer networks while we compete with all alternative parts suppliers there are few with a distribution network reaching most major markets in the uk we believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other alternative parts suppliers primarily through our distribution network which allows us to deliver our products quickly as well as through our product lines and inventory availability pricing and service we compete with oems primarily on the basis of price service and availability 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 20300 employees we are a party to a collective bargaining agreement with a union that represents 44 employees at our totowa new jersey facility approximately 660 of our employees at our bumper refurbishing and engine remanufacturing operations in mexico and 160 of our employees at our recycled parts facility in quebec city canada are also represented by unions other than these locations none of our employees is a member of a union or participates in other collective bargaining arrangements we consider our employee relations to be good 

facilities 

our corporate headquarters are located at 500 west madison street chicago illinois 60661 we also operate a field support center in nashville tennessee that performs certain corporate functions including accounting procurement and 

information systems support our european operations maintain procurement accounting and finance functions in wembley outside of london england in addition to these corporate offices we have numerous operating facilities that handle wholesale and self service retail product operations we operate out of more than 500  locations in total most of which are leased many of our locations stock multiple product types or serve more than one function 

included in our total locations are 131 facilities in the uk including the 500000 square foot national distribution center in tamworth that houses inventory to supply the hubs and branches of our uk operations we also operate 37 facilities in canada five facilities in central america and two facilities in mexico in 2012 we opened an aftermarket parts warehouse in taiwan to aggregate inventory for shipment to our locations in north america 

information technology 

in our north american operations our aftermarket operations use a third party facility management system additional third party software packages have been implemented to leverage the centralized data and information that a single system provides such as a data warehouse to conduct enhanced analytics and reporting an integrated budgeting system an electronic data interchange tool and ecommerce tools to enhance our online businesstobusiness initiatives—orderkeystonecom and keyless the systems used by our aftermarket operations are also used by all of our refurbishing operations 

our wholesale recycled product locations in north america operate an internallydeveloped proprietary facility management system called lkqx we believe that the use of a single system across all of our wholesale recycled product operations helps facilitate the sales process allows for continued implementation of standard operating procedures and yields improved training efficiency employee transferability access to our national inventory database management reporting and data storage the system also supports an electronic exchange process for identifying and locating parts at other select recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock 

our remanufacturing operations currently operate on three separate it systems which we expect to transition to a single it platform in the next year we operate a single enterprise system for all of our heavyduty truck operations that supports interregion sales to reduce the potential for lost sales due to outofstock parts in 2011 we completed the installation of a standardized point of sale system in our self service retail operations which allows enhanced management reporting as well as improved system reliability 

our aftermarket operations in the uk use a single integrated it platform for our purchasing branch stock and finance activities which are further supported by a distribution center system to manage inventory movement 

the hardware that supports the systems used in our operations is located in offsite data centers the centers are in secure environments with aroundtheclock monitoring redundant power backup and multiple diverse data and telecommunication routing we use separate third party provided software for our financial systems such as financial and budget reporting general ledger accounting accounts payable payroll and fixed assets we currently protect our local customer inventory and corporate consolidated data such as financial information email files and other user files with daily backups these backups are stored off site with a third party data protection vendor 

we continually evaluate our systems with the goal of ensuring that all critical systems remain scalable and operational as our business grows 

regulation 

environmental compliance 

our operations and properties including the maintenance of our delivery vehicles are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations these environmental laws govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials 

we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters we have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements we cannot assure you however that we will at all times be in complete compliance with such requirements 

although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly environmental laws may change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

contamination resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release storage transportation or disposal of gasoline motor oil antifreeze transmission fluid chlorofluorocarbons cfcs from air conditioners other hazardous materials or metals such as aluminum cadmium chromium lead and mercury contamination from the refurbishment of chrome plated bumpers can occur from the release of the plating material contamination can migrate onsite or offsite which can increase the risk and the amount of any potential liability 

in addition many of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use that may have involved hazardous materials as a result some of our properties may be contaminated some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination even if these owners or operators did not know of and were not responsible for such contamination these environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of treats or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties or successors to such owners or operators for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 

when we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process we analyze the risks and when appropriate perform further environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination furthermore where appropriate we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters in addition at times we or sellers from whom we purchased a business have undertaken remediation projects we do not anticipate based on currently available information and current laws that we will incur liabilities in excess of reserves to address environmental matters however in the event we discover new information or if laws change we may incur significant liabilities which may exceed our reserves 

title laws 

in some states when a vehicle is deemed a total loss a salvage title is issued whether states issue salvage titles is important to the supply of inventory for the vehicle recycling industry because an increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles currently these titling issues are a matter of state law in 1992 the us congress commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle titling registration and salvage since then legislation has been introduced seeking to establish national uniform requirements in this area including a uniform definition of a salvage vehicle the vehicle recycling industry will generally favor a uniform definition since it will avoid inconsistencies across state lines and will generally favor a definition that expands the number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage however certain interest groups including repair shops and some insurance associations may oppose this type of legislation national legislation has not yet been enacted in this area and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in the future 

anticar theft act 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any covered major part the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on vehicle recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may further discourage the use by such shops of recycled products there is no pending initiative to implement the parts registration from a law enforcement point of view however there is a risk that a heightened legislative concern over safety of parts might precipitate an effort to push for the implementation of such rules 

legislation affecting automotive repair parts 

most states have laws relating to the use of aftermarket products in motor vehicle collision repair work the provisions of these laws include consumer disclosure vehicle owners consent regarding the use of aftermarket products in the repair process and the requirement to have aftermarket products certified by an independent testing organization some jurisdictions have laws that regulate the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags additional laws of this kind may be enacted in the future an increase in the number of states passing such legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on our business additionally congress could enact federal legislation restricting the use of aftermarket and recycled automotive products used in the course of collision repair 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our collision products because there are more weather related accidents which generate repairs in addition the cost of salvage vehicles may be lower as weather related accidents generate a larger supply of total loss vehicles 




 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

our operating results and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the economic conditions in the us and elsewhere 

the decline and slow growth in economic conditions in the us the uk and canada adversely impacted our business such conditions have in some periods resulted in fewer miles driven fewer accident claims and a reduction of vehicle repairs in the event that the economic conditions in the us or other countries decline or do not improve we expect that our business will be negatively affected 

we face intense competition from local national international and internetbased vehicle products providers and this competition could negatively affect our business 

the vehicle replacement products industry is highly competitive and is served by numerous suppliers of oem recycled aftermarket refurbished and remanufactured products within each of these categories of suppliers there are local owneroperated companies larger regional suppliers national and international providers and internetbased suppliers providers of vehicle replacement products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of vehicle replacement products which may further increase competition some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise greater financial technical manufacturing distribution and other resources longer operating histories lower cost structures and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries or with consumers than we do in certain regions of the us local vehicle recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in the wholesale recycled products industry as a result of these factors our competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply provide their products at lower costs or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve 

we believe that substantially in excess of 50 of collision parts by dollar amount are supplied by oems with the balance being supplied by distributors like us the oems are therefore in a position to exert pricing pressure in the marketplace we compete with the oems primarily on price and to a lesser extent on service and quality from time to time oems have experimented with reducing prices on specific products to match the lower prices of alternative products if such price reductions were to become widespread it could have a material adverse impact on our business 

claims by oems relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business 

oems have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims the oems have brought such claims in federal court and with the us international trade commission 

in december 2005 and may 2008 ford global technologies llc filed complaints with the international trade commission against us and others alleging that certain aftermarket products imported into the us infringed on ford design patents the parties settled these matters in april 2009 pursuant to a settlement arrangement that expires in march 2015 

us patent and trademark office records indicate that oems are seeking and obtaining more design patents then they have in the past to the extent that the oems are successful with intellectual property infringement claims we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business we will likely incur significant expenses investigating and defending intellectual property infringement claims in addition aftermarket products certifying organizations may revoke the certification of parts that are the subject of the claims lack of certification may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of aftermarket products only if they have been certified by an independent certifying organization 

an adverse change in our relationships with our suppliers or auction companies could increase our expenses and hurt our ability to serve our customers 

we are dependent on a relatively small number of suppliers of aftermarket products most of which are located in taiwan although alternative suppliers exist for substantially all aftermarket products distributed by us the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on us until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced providing 

products moreover our operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad including among other things transportation costs and delays political instability currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs import and export controls and other nontariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas as well as the uncertainty regarding future relations between china japan and taiwan because a substantial volume of our sales involves products manufactured from sheet metal we can be adversely impacted if sheet metal becomes unavailable or is only available at higher prices which we may not be able to pass on to our customers in addition there is a limited supply of salvage vehicles in the us as we grow and our demand for salvage vehicles increases the costs of these incremental vehicles could be higher 

most of our salvage and a portion of our self service inventory is obtained from vehicles offered at salvage auctions operated by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the us we do not typically have contracts with any auction company according to industry analysts a small number of companies control a large percentage of the salvage auction market in the us if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions began competing with us or significantly raised its fees our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers moreover we face competition in the purchase of vehicles from direct competitors rebuilders exporters and others to the extent that the number of bidders increases it may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold for wholesale recycled products some states regulate bidders to help ensure that salvage vehicles are purchased for legal purposes by qualified buyers auction companies have been actively seeking to reduce circumvent or eliminate these regulations which would further increase the number of bidders 

we also acquire inventory directly from insurance companies oems and others to the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue these arrangements our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers 

we rely upon insurance companies to promote the usage of alternative parts 

our success depends in part on the acceptance and promotion of alternative parts usage by automotive insurance companies alternative parts usage has generally increased from year to year but there can be no assurance that such usage will increase in the future in addition in some places we operate alternative parts usage is relatively low we also rely on business relationships with several insurance companies these insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide the business relationships include in some cases participation in aftermarket quality and service assurance programs that may result in a higher usage of our aftermarket products than would be the case without the programs our arrangements with these companies may be terminated by them at any time including in connection with their own business concerns relating to the offering availability standards or operations of the aftermarket quality and service assurance programs we rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in an illinois lawsuit involving state farm mutual automobile insurance company avery v state farm a jury decided in october 1999 that state farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using nonoem replacement products to repair damaged vehicles when use of such products did not restore the vehicle to its preloss condition the jury found that state farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of nonoem replacement products and the alleged inferiority of those products the jury assessed damages against state farm of 456 million and the judge assessed an additional 730 million of disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the illinois consumer fraud act in april 2001 the illinois appellate court upheld the verdict but reduced the damage award by 130 million because of duplicative damage awards on august 18 2005 the illinois supreme court reversed the awards made by the circuit court and found among other things that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any breach of contract by state farm the us supreme court declined to hear an appeal of this case as a result of this case some insurance companies reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket products our financial results could be adversely affected if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled products from us due to a fear of similar claims 

we may not be able to sell our products due to existing or new laws and regulations prohibiting or restricting the sale of wholesale aftermarket recycled refurbished or remanufactured products 

some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled products restrictions on the products we are able to sell could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

most states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair work andor require enhanced disclosure or vehicle owner consent before using aftermarket products in such repair work additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future if additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business 

certain organizations test the quality and safety of vehicle replacement products if these organizations decide not to test a particular vehicle product or in the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product such events could adversely affect our business 

we may not be able to successfully acquire new businesses or integrate acquisitions which could cause our business to suffer 

we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms or for other reasons moreover we may not be able to identify a sufficient number of acquisition candidates at reasonable prices to maintain our growth objectives also over time we will likely seek to make acquisitions that are relatively larger as we grow larger acquisition candidates may attract additional competitive buyers which could increase our cost or could cause us to lose such acquisitions 

if we buy a company or a division of a company we may experience difficulty integrating that companys or divisions personnel and operations which could negatively affect our operating results in addition 

 our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control future factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to those listed in the special note on forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k accordingly our results of operations may not be indicative of future performance these fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which could cause our stock price or the value of our debt instruments to decline 

fluctuations in the prices of metals or shipping costs could adversely affect our financial results 

all of our recycling operations generate scrap metal and other metals that we sell after we dismantle a salvage vehicle for wholesale parts and after vehicles have been used in our self service retail business the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors and other remaining metals are sold to processors and brokers of metals in addition we receive crush only vehicles from other companies including oems which we dismantle and which generate scrap metal and other metals the prices of scrap and other metals have historically fluctuated sometimes significantly due to market factors in addition buyers may stop purchasing metals entirely due to excess supply to the extent that the prices of metals decrease materially or buyers stop purchasing metals our revenue from such sales will suffer and a writedown of our inventory value could be required the cost of our wholesale recycled and our self service retail inventory purchases will change as a result of fluctuating scrap metal and other metals prices in a period of falling metal prices there can be no assurance that our inventory purchasing cost will decrease the same amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal and other metals prices decline and there may be a delay between the scrap metal and other metals price reductions and any inventory cost reductions the price of steel is a component of the cost to manufacture products for our aftermarket business we incur substantial freight costs to import parts from our suppliers many of whom are located in asia if the cost of steel or freight rose we might not be able to pass the cost increases on to our customers 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur significant charges to our pretax income 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations in the future goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of acquisitions goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses increases in our cost of capital adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including modifications that restrict the activities of the acquired business as of december 31 2012  our total goodwill subject to future impairment testing was 17 billion  for further discussion of our annual impairment test see goodwill impairment in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of item 7 in this annual report on form 10k 

if the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines or the number of cars being repaired declines our business could suffer 

because our business depends on vehicle accidents for both the demand for repairs using our products and the supply of wholesale recycled products factors which influence the number andor severity of accidents including but not limited to the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven the ages of drivers the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions the congestion of traffic the use of cellular telephones and other electronic equipment by drivers the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers the effectiveness of accident avoidance systems in new vehicles and the condition of roadways impact our business an increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road to decline and the number of miles driven to decline as motorists seek alternative transportation options and this also could lead to a decline in accidents in addition since 2007 the average number of new vehicles sold annually in the us has been less than the average number of new vehicles sold annually from 1999 through 2006 this could result in a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road and consequently fewer vehicles involved in accidents mild weather conditions particularly during winter months tend to result in a decrease of vehicle accidents moreover a number of states and municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones while driving and such restrictions could lead to a decline in accidents to the extent oems develop or are mandated by law to install new accident avoidance systems the number and severity of accidents could decrease in addition the average age of vehicles has been increasing and insurance companies may find it uneconomical to repair older vehicles 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits 

our operating subsidiaries must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations when we develop or acquire a new facility we must seek the approval of state and local units of government governmental agencies may resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling or refurbishing facility in their communities there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold 

if we lose our key management personnel we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives if we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel which could harm our business 

we rely on information technology and communication systems in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business 

some of the information technology systems and communication systems we use for management of our facilities and our financial functions are leased from or operated by other companies while others are owned by us in the event that the providers of these systems terminate their relationships with us or if we suffer prolonged outages of these or our own systems for whatever reason we could suffer disruptions to our operations 

in addition we continually monitor these systems to find areas for improvement in the event that we decided to switch providers or to implement our own systems we may also suffer disruptions to our business we may be unsuccessful in the development of our own systems and we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing our own systems also our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system which period could extend longer than we anticipated 

if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks our business could be harmed 

we use a fleet of trucks to deliver the majority of the products we sell we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in the transportation infrastructure governmental regulation availability and price of fuel liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance and insurance premium increases in addition our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials 

we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials 

under certain environmental laws we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at or migration to or from our or our predecessors past or present facilities and at independent waste disposal sites these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or was not responsible for the release of such hazardous substances 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we could be subject to product liability claims 

if customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage we could be subject to product liability claims by such customers the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we have agreed to defend and indemnify in certain circumstances insurance companies that could be named as defendants in such lawsuits the existence of claims for which we must defend and indemnify insurance companies could negatively impact our business results of operations or financial condition 

regulations that may be issued under the anticar theft act could harm our business 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any covered major part the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on automotive parts recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may further discourage the use of recycled products by such shops 

we operate in foreign jurisdictions which exposes us to foreign exchange and other risks 

we have operations in the uk canada and mexico and we may expand our operations into other countries we also incur costs in currencies other than our functional currencies in the countries in which we operate we are thus subject to foreign exchange exposure to the extent that we operate in different currencies as well as exposure to foreign tax and other foreign and domestic laws in addition mexico is currently experiencing a heightened level of criminal activity that could affect our ability to maintain our supply of certain aftermarket products 

risks relating to our common stock and financial structure 

future sales of our common stock or other securities may depress our stock price 

we and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock or other equity debt or instruments which constitute an element of our debt and equity collectively securities in the future we may also issue shares of common stock under our 

equity incentive plan or in connection with future acquisitions we cannot predict the size of future issuances of securities or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock or other securities will have on the price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued in connection with an acquisition the issuance of additional debt securities or the perception that such sales or issuances could occur may cause the price of our common stock to fall 

delaware law our charter documents and our loan documents may impede or discourage a takeover which could affect the price of our stock 

the antitakeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws our loan documents and delaware law could together or separately impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult our credit agreement provides that a change of control is an event of default our incorporation under delaware law and these provisions could also impede an acquisition takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the price of our common stock 

our credit agreement places restrictions on our business 

we have a senior secured debt financing facility with a group of lenders our total outstanding indebtedness including bank financing letters of credit and notes payable in connection with acquisitions as of december 31 2012  was 12 billion the credit agreement contains operating and financial restrictions and requires that we satisfy certain financial and other covenants the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit agreement a default if not waived could result in acceleration of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing credit facility or it may be on terms that are not acceptable to us 

we rely on an accounts receivable securitization program for a portion of our liquidity 

we have an arrangement whereby we sell an interest in a portion of our accounts receivable to a special purpose vehicle and receive funding through the commercial paper market this arrangement expires in september 2015 in the event that the market for commercial paper were to close or otherwise become constrained our cost of credit relative to this program could rise or credit could be unavailable altogether 

our future capital needs may require that we seek to refinance our debt or obtain additional debt or equity financing events that could have a negative effect on our business 

we may need to raise additional funds in the future to among other things refinance existing debt fund our existing operations improve or expand our operations respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions from time to time we may raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic alliances or other arrangements however turmoil in the credit markets could result in tight credit conditions which could affect our ability to raise additional funds if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and further limitations on our operations if we refinance or restructure our debt we may incur charges to write off the unamortized portion of deferred debt issuance costs from a previous financing or we may incur charges related to hedge ineffectiveness from our interest rate swap obligations if we fail to raise capital when needed our business may be negatively affected 

future adjustments to contingent purchase price related to acquisitions could materially affect our results 

from time to time we acquire companies with a component of the purchase consideration being delayed and the payment thereof contingent on certain performance or other factors including the time value of money the contingent purchase price the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that we estimate the amount of the contingent purchase price at the time we complete the acquisition each subsequent reporting period until the contingent purchase price is either paid or no longer potentially payable we are required to reevaluate the estimated amount of remaining contingent purchase price that is likely to be paid if the revised estimate of the contingent purchase price is higher than the amount accrued then the difference must be recorded and charged to the income statement in that period if the revised estimate of the future contingent purchase price is lower than the amount accrued then the accrual is reduced and the difference is credited to income for the period because some of these payments would not be deductible for tax purposes it is possible 

that the expense or income would not be taxeffected on our income statements these adjustments if required could be material to our future results of operations

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend overview 

we provide replacement parts components and systems needed to repair cars and trucks buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers oems which are commonly known as oem products new products produced by companies other than the oems which are sometimes referred to as aftermarket products recycled products originally produced by oems used products that have been refurbished and used products that have been remanufactured 

we distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops including aftermarket collision and mechanical products recycled collision and mechanical products refurbished collision replacement products such as wheels bumper covers and lights and remanufactured engines collectively we refer to our products as alternative parts we are the nations largest provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and a leading provider of alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products with our sales processing and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the united states our wholesale operations also reach most major markets in canada and we are a leading provider of alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products in the united kingdom in addition to our wholesale operations we operate self service retail facilities across the us that sell recycled automotive products we have organized our businesses into three operating segments wholesale—north america wholesale—europe and self service we aggregate our north american operating segments wholesale—north america and self service into one reportable segment resulting in two reportable segments north america and europe 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to those listed in the special note on forwardlooking statements in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k accordingly our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance

since our inception in 1998 we have pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions we have pursued acquisitions that we believe will help drive profitability cash flow and stockholder value our principal focus for acquisitions is companies that will expand our geographic presence and our ability to provide a wider choice of alternative vehicle replacement products to our customers 

in 2012 we made 30  acquisitions in north america which included 22  wholesale businesses and eight  self service retail operations these acquisitions enabled us to expand our geographic presence and enter new markets additionally two of our acquisitions were completed with a goal of improving the recovery from scrap and other metals harvested from the vehicles we purchase a precious metals refining and reclamation business which we acquired with the goal of improving the profitability of the precious metals we extract from our recycled vehicle parts and a scrap metal shredder which we expect will improve the profitability of the scrap metals recovered from the vehicle hulks in certain of our recycled product operations 

subsequent to december 31 2012 we completed the acquisition of an aftermarket product distributor in the uk and a paint distribution business in canada we expect to make additional strategic acquisitions in 2013 in domestic and international markets as we continue to build an integrated distribution network offering a broad range of alternative parts 

in october 2011 we expanded our operations into the european automotive aftermarket business through our acquisition of euro car parts holdings limited ecp as of december 31 2012  ecp operated out of 130 branches supported by a national distribution center and nine regional hubs from which multiple deliveries are made each day ecps product offerings are primarily focused on automotive aftermarket mechanical products many of which are sourced from the same suppliers that provide products to the oems the expansion of our geographic presence beyond north america into the european market offers an opportunity to us as that market has historically had a low penetration of alternative collision parts 

in addition to our acquisition of ecp we made 20 acquisitions in north america in 2011 17 wholesale businesses and three self service retail operations our acquisitions included the purchase of two engine remanufacturers which expanded our presence in the remanufacturing industry that we entered in 2010 additionally our acquisition of an automotive heating and cooling component distributor supplements our expansion into the automotive heating and cooling aftermarket products market our north american wholesale business acquisitions also included the purchase of the us vehicle refinish paint distribution business of akzo nobel automotive and aerospace coatings the “akzo nobel paint business” which allowed us to increase our paint and related product offerings and expand our geographic presence in the automotive paint market our other 2011 acquisitions enabled us to expand our geographic presence and enter new markets 

in 2010 we made 20 acquisitions in north america 18 wholesale businesses and two self service retail operations our acquisitions included the purchase of an engine remanufacturer which allowed us to further vertically integrate our supply chain we expanded our product offerings through the acquisition of an automotive heating and cooling component business as well as a tire recycling business our 2010 acquisitions also enabled us to expand our geographic presence most notably in canada through our purchase of cross canada an aftermarket product supplier 

divestitures 

in connection with our 2009 agreement with schnitzer steel industries inc we agreed to sell two self service retail facilities in dallas texas on january 15 2010 these facilities qualified for treatment as discontinued operations the financial results of these facilities are segregated from our continuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented the remaining liabilities of discontinued operations are not material to our financial position for the periods presented unless otherwise noted this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates only to financial results from continuing operations 

sources of revenue 

we report our revenue in three categories i aftermarket other new and refurbished products ii recycled remanufactured and related products and services and iii other 

our revenue from the sale of vehicle replacement products and related services includes sales of i aftermarket other new and refurbished products and ii recycled remanufactured and related products and services during 2012  sales of vehicle replacement products and services represented approximately 86  of our consolidated sales of these sales approximately 64  was derived from the sales of aftermarket other new and refurbished products while 36  was composed of recycled and remanufactured products and services sales our services revenue which includes secure disposal of crush only vehicles represented less than 1 of our parts and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 

we sell the majority of our vehicle replacement products to collision and mechanical repair shops our vehicle replacement products include sheet metal crash parts such as doors hoods and fenders bumper covers engines head and tail lamps and wheels for an additional fee we sell extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products these contracts cover the cost of parts and labor and are sold for periods of six months one year two years or a nontransferable lifetime warranty we defer the revenue from such contracts and recognize it ratably over the term of the contracts or three years in the case of lifetime warranties the demand for our products and services is influenced by several factors including the number of vehicles in operation the number of miles being driven the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents the age profile of vehicles in accidents availability and pricing of new oem parts seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions additionally automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process accordingly we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our products while they are not our direct customers we do provide insurance carriers services in an effort to promote the increased usage of alternative replacement products in the repair process such services include the review of vehicle repair order estimates direct quotation services to insurance company adjusters and an aftermarket parts quality and service assurance program we neither charge a fee to the insurance carriers for these services nor adjust our pricing of products for our customers when we perform these services for insurance carriers 

there is no standard price for many of our products but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as product availability quality demand new oem product prices the age and mileage of the vehicle from which the part was obtained and competitor pricing 

in 2012  revenue from other sources represented approximately 14  of our consolidated sales these other sources include scrap sales and sales of aluminum ingots and sows we derive scrap metal from several sources including vehicles that have been used in both our wholesale and self service recycling operations and from oems and other entities that contract with us for secure disposal of crush only vehicles with our acquisition of a precious metals refining and reclamation business in the second quarter of 2012 we also generate revenue from the sales of precious metals harvested from various sources including certain of our salvage vehicle parts other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold 

cost of goods sold 

our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts freight and overhead costs including labor fuel expense and facility and machinery costs related to the purchasing warehousing and distribution of our inventory our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors our cost of goods sold for refurbished products includes the price we pay for inventory freight and costs to refurbish the parts including direct and indirect labor facility costs including rent and utilities machinery and equipment costs including equipment rental repairs and maintenance depreciation and other overhead related to refurbishing operations 

our cost of goods sold for recycled products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and where applicable auction storage and towing fees prices for salvage vehicles may be impacted by a variety of factors including the number of buyers competing to purchase the vehicles the demand and pricing trends for used vehicles the number of vehicles designated as “total losses” by insurance companies the production level of new vehicles which provides the source from which salvage vehicles ultimately come and the status of laws regulating bidders or exporters of salvage vehicles due to changes relating to these factors we have seen the prices we pay for salvage vehicles fluctuate over time our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles our labor and laborrelated costs related to acquisition and dismantling account for approximately 9 of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle the acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and as a result energy costs are not material our cost of goods sold for remanufactured products includes the price we pay for cores freight costs to remanufacture the products including direct and indirect labor rent depreciation and other overhead related to remanufacturing operations 

some of our salvage mechanical products are sold with a standard sixmonth warranty against defects additionally some of our remanufactured engines are sold with a standard threeyear warranty against defects we also provide a limited lifetime warranty for certain of our aftermarket products we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claims information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses we also sell separately priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products the expense related to extended warranty claims is recognized when the claim is made 

 other revenue is primarily generated from the hulks and unusable parts of the vehicles we acquire for our wholesale and self service recycled product operations and therefore the costs of these sales include the proportionate share of the price we pay for the salvage vehicles as well as the applicable auction storage and towing fees and internal costs to purchase and dismantle the vehicles our cost of goods sold for other revenue will fluctuate based on the prices paid for salvage vehicles which may be impacted by a variety of factors as discussed above 

expenses 

our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our aftermarket warehouses salvage yards and self service retail facilities these costs include labor for plant management and facility and warehouse personnel and related incentive compensation and employee benefits rent utilities repairs and maintenance costs related to our facilities and equipment and other facility expenses such as property insurance and taxes the costs included in facility and warehouse expenses do not relate to inventory processing or conversion activities and as such are classified below the gross margin line on our consolidated statements of income 

our distribution expenses primarily include our costs to prepare and deliver our products to our customers included in our distribution expense category are labor costs for drivers fuel third party freight costs local delivery and transfer truck leases or rentals and related repairs and maintenance and insurance and supplies 

our selling and marketing expenses primarily include salary commission and other incentive compensation expenses for sales personnel advertising promotion and marketing costs telephone and other communication expenses credit card fees and bad debt expense personnel costs account for approximately 80 of our selling and marketing expenses most of our product sales personnel are paid on a commission basis the number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our customers’ needs and increase our sales volume our objective is to continually evaluate our sales force develop and implement training programs and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness 

our general and administrative expenses primarily include the costs of our corporate offices and field support center that provide corporate and field management treasury accounting legal payroll business development human resources and information systems functions these costs include wages and benefits for corporate regional and administrative personnel stockbased compensation and other incentive compensation it system support and maintenance expenses accounting legal and other professional fees and supplies 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather related accidents which generate repairs in addition the cost of salvage vehicles may be lower as weather related accidents generate a larger supply of total loss vehicles 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition inventory valuation business combinations and goodwill impairment we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue actual results may differ from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize and report revenue from the sale of vehicle replacement products when they are shipped or picked up by the customers and title has transferred subject to an allowance for estimated returns discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information a product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment our customers may earn discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment we analyze historical returns and allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates we use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold if actual returns and allowances are higher than our historical experience there would be an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence 

for an additional fee we also sell extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products revenue from these contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the contracts or three years in the case of lifetime warranties 

we recognize revenue from the sale of scrap cores and other metals when title has transferred which typically occurs upon delivery to the customer 

inventory accounting 

aftermarket and refurbished product inventory  our aftermarket inventory cost is established based on the average price we pay for parts and includes expenses incurred for freight and overhead costs for items purchased from foreign companies import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included refurbished inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for cores and also includes expenses incurred for freight labor and other overhead 

salvage and remanufactured inventory  our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle including auction storage and towing fees as well as expenditures for buying and dismantling inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facilitys inventory at expected selling prices the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facilitys historical vehicle profitability for salvage vehicles purchased at auction or from contracted rates for salvage vehicles acquired under certain direct procurement arrangements remanufactured inventory cost is based upon the price paid for cores and also includes expenses incurred for freight direct manufacturing costs and overhead 

for all inventory carrying value is recorded at the lower of cost or market and is reduced to reflect the age of the inventory and current anticipated demand if actual demand differs from our estimates additional reductions to inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made 

business combinations 

we record our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values we utilize management estimates and in some instances independent thirdparty valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and contingent consideration granted such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions including projections of future events and operating performance the purchase price allocation is subject to change during the measurement period which is limited to one year subsequent to the acquisition date 

for certain acquisitions we may issue contingent consideration under which additional payments will be made to the former owners if specified future events occur or conditions are met such as meeting profitability or earnings targets each contingent consideration obligation is measured at the acquisition date fair value of the consideration which is determined using the discounted probabilityweighted expected cash flows at each subsequent reporting period we remeasure the liability at fair value and record any changes to the fair value through change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities within other expense income on our consolidated statements of income the fair value measurement of the liability is performed by our corporate accounting department using current information about key assumptions with the input and oversight of our operational and executive management teams each reporting period we evaluate the performance of the business compared to our previous expectations along with any changes to our future projections and update the estimated cash flows accordingly in addition we consider changes to our cost of capital and changes to the probability of achieving the earnout payment targets when updating our discount rate on a quarterly basis 

 increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates variances between actual results achieved and projected results changes in the projected results of the acquired business or changes in our assessment of the probabilities surrounding the achievement of targets detailed in the respective agreements as of december 31 2012  we recorded 900 million  of contingent consideration liabilities actual payouts under these contingent consideration arrangements will be determined at the end of the performance periods and if the maximum payments were earned the total payout would be approximately 117 million 

goodwill impairment 

we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually when testing goodwill for impairment we are required to evaluate events and circumstances that may affect the performance of the reporting unit and the extent to which the events and circumstances may impact the future cash flows of the reporting unit to determine whether the fair value of the assets exceed the carrying value if these assumptions or estimates change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill 

we are organized into three operating segments wholesale—north america wholesale—europe and self service we have also concluded that these three operating segments are reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing in 2012  we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist during 2012  we did not identify any events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts therefore we did not perform any impairment tests other than our annual test in the fourth quarter of 2012  

our goodwill would be considered impaired if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value the fair value estimates are established using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach we believe that using two methods to determine fair value limits the chances of an unrepresentative valuation as of december 31 2012  we had a total of 17 billion  in goodwill subject to future impairment tests if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results we determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2012  a 10 decrease in the fair value estimates of the reporting units in the annual impairment test would not have changed this determination and each of the reporting units had a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value

results of operations—consolidated 

the following table sets forth statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated 



year ended december 31 2012  compared to year ended december 31 2011   

revenue  our revenue increased 261  to 41 billion  for the year ended   december 31 2012  from 33 billion  in 2011 the increase in revenue was due to 219  acquisition related revenue growth and 41  organic growth which was composed of 60  parts and services revenue partially offset by a 58  decline in other revenue due to declining scrap steel and other metals prices acquisition related revenue growth for the year ended   december 31 2012  totaled 7168 million which included 4816 million from our fourth quarter 2011 acquisition of ecp our organic revenue growth in aftermarket other new and refurbished products of 62  is primarily a result of higher volumes incremental sales volume from ecps new branches which we include in organic revenue contributed 44 of the growth the remaining volume increase is primarily attributable to greater customer penetration resulting from our expansion into complementary product lines such as paint and related products our organic revenue from the sale of recycled and remanufactured products grew 58  primarily as a result of higher sales volumes which resulted from higher inventory purchases that contributed to a greater volume of parts available for sale organic revenue growth in parts and services was negatively affected by milder winter weather conditions in north america in the first quarter and into the beginning of the second quarter of 2012 as the milder winter weather contributed to fewer and less severe vehicle accidents resulting in lower insurance claims activity 

cost of goods sold  our cost of goods sold increased to 582  of revenue in 2012  from 574  of revenue in 2011 in 2012 the prices we received for scrap metal declined relative to the cost of the scrap component of the cars that we crushed while in the prior year scrap metal prices increased relative to the cost component the resulting margin compression in our self service and wholesale  north america segments contributed 06 of the increase in cost of goods sold our acquisition of ecp which generates lower gross margins than our north american business because of a greater weighting on lower margin mechanical products increased our cost of goods sold by 03 of revenue our cost of goods sold for the year ended   december 31 2012  also reflects a 02 increase as a result of the lower gross margins generated by our precious metals refining and reclamation business that we acquired in the second quarter of 2012 higher warranty claims experience in 2012 primarily related to our remanufactured engines increased cost of goods sold by 02 of revenue our cost of goods sold for 2012 also reflects lower levels of revenue from high margin crush only vehicles compared to the prior year which increased cost of goods sold by 02 these increases in our cost of goods sold were partially offset by a 02 reduction in cost of goods sold for lower vehicle acquisition costs primarily in our wholesale  north america segment additionally we recognized a gain on lawsuit settlements totaling 179 million  which reduced cost of goods sold by 04 of revenue see note 8 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the lawsuit settlements 

facility and warehouse expenses  as a percentage of revenue facility and warehouse expenses for the year ended   december 31 2012  decreased to 84  of revenue compared to 90  in 2011 which was primarily due to lower facility and warehouse expense in our european operations as compared to our north american operations the branch locations in the uk are typically smaller and less costly than the warehouse locations in north america since the majority of the inventory is stored in the national distribution center in the uk which supplies the branch locations daily in our north american operations most of the inventory sold by our locations is stored on site rather than in regional or national distribution centers the cost of the national distribution center in the uk is capitalized into inventory and expensed through cost of goods sold 

distribution expenses  as a percentage of revenue distribution expenses increased to 91  of revenue in 2012 from 88  of revenue in 2011 primarily resulting from an increase of 02 related to our european operations our european operations which generate a greater proportion of revenue from sales to mechanical repair shops compared to our north american operations incur relatively higher delivery expenses as garage customers demand faster delivery times than our north american collision repair customers in our north american operations distribution expenses increased by 02 of revenue due to higher compensation costs as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior year 

selling general and administrative expenses  our selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended   december 31 2012  were consistent with the prior year at 120  of revenue our european operations increased selling general and administrative expenses by 02 of revenue primarily due to greater personnel expenditures for the relatively larger sales force compared to our north american operations the impact of higher selling expenses in our european operations was offset by a reduction in general and administrative personnel expenditures including incentive compensation as a percentage of revenue in our north american operations 

restructuring and acquisition related expenses  during 2012 and 2011 we incurred 28 million  and 76 million  of restructuring and acquisition related expenses respectively in 2012 we incurred 11 million to execute our restructuring plan to consolidate our bumper and wheel refurbishing product lines we also incurred 12 million of restructuring expenses related to the integration of certain of our 2011 and 2012 acquisitions into our existing business our 2011 expenses included 40 million related to integration of our 2011 acquisition of the akzo nobel paint business and our 2010 acquisition of cross canada a canadian aftermarket business we also incurred 04 million of integration costs related to certain of our other acquisitions acquisition related expenses which consist of external costs such as closing costs and professional fees totaled 05 million and 32 million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively our acquisition related expenses in 2011 primarily related to our acquisition of ecp on october 1 2011 see note 10 restructuring and acquisition related expenses  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our restructuring and integration plans 

depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization expense was 16  in 2012 compared to 15  in 2011 higher expense in 2012 resulting from our increased levels of property and equipment and higher levels of intangible assets as a result of business acquisitions was mostly offset by continued leveraging of our existing facilities to support organic revenue growth 

other expense net  total other expense net increased to 288 million  for the year ended   december 31 2012  from 257 million  for the prior year this increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of 71 million compared to the prior year partially offset by a 53 million  loss on debt extinguishment recognized in 2011 related to the write off of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the execution of our senior secured credit agreement the increase in interest expense in 2012 was due to higher average outstanding bank borrowings of 922 million compared to 671 million in 2011 primarily as a result of additional borrowings to finance our acquisition of ecp in the fourth quarter of 2011 the effect of higher average debt levels was partially offset by a reduction in our average effective interest rate on bank borrowings to 31 in 2012 from 34 in 2011 resulting from lower interest rates under our credit agreement in 2012 we recognized 16 million  of expense as a result of fair value adjustments to our contingent payment liabilities while we recognized a 14 million  gain in 2011 adjustments to our contingent consideration liabilities may cause variability in our results of operations as changes in the assumptions used to measure the fair value of the liabilities may result in net gains or losses from period to period we increased our collections of fees for late payments in 2012 which increased other income by 16 million over the prior year in 2012 the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in the canadian dollar the british pound and other currencies was a gain of 02 million compared to a loss of 04 million in 2011 

provision for income taxes  our effective income tax rate was 362  and 374  for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011 respectively the lower effective income tax rate in 2012 reflects a benefit of 15 relative to the prior year from our expanding international operations as a larger proportion of our pretax income was generated in lower rate jurisdictions other rate effects from discrete items and permanent differences were 03 higher in 2012 than the prior year 

year ended december 31 2011  compared to year ended december 31 2010   

revenue  our revenue increased 324 to 33 billion in 2011 compared to 25 billion in 2010 the increase in revenue was primarily due to business acquisitions the higher volume of products we sold and higher revenue from scrap metal and other metals sales our acquisition related revenue growth of 215 includes 138 million of incremental revenue generated by ecp since its acquisition effective october 1 2011 our total organic revenue growth rate was 107 composed of 79 and 280 organic growth in parts and services revenue and other revenue respectively organic growth in parts and services revenue reflects the increase in salvage revenue over relatively lower levels during the prior year due primarily to volume increases the prior year period was impacted by the cash for clunkers program under which we purchased lower cost older vehicles that did not have the same parts revenue potential as our more recent inventory purchases additionally during the first quarter of 2010 we reduced purchases of salvage vehicles due to higher acquisition prices at the salvage auctions resulting in lower volume of salvage parts available for sale during the first two quarters of 2010 during the second half of 2011 our organic revenue growth rate in parts and services revenue of 65 reflected the lessening impact of the cash for clunkers program and lower buying levels on the prior year results our aftermarket revenue increased primarily due to growth in sales volumes which resulted from higher inventory purchases that contributed to a greater volume of parts available for sale the growth in other revenue which includes sales of scrap metal and other metals was primarily due to higher metals prices combined with higher volume of scrap sold we also had a 01 favorable impact on revenue as a result of foreign exchange in our canadian operations 

cost of goods sold  our cost of goods sold increased to 574 of revenue in 2011 from 557 of revenue in 2010 of the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue 08 was due to higher input costs combined with competitive sales pricing pressure in our aftermarket products cost of goods sold in 2011 was also impacted by a shift in product mix which increased cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue by 06 certain of our acquisitions toward the end of 2010 and during 2011 increased our revenue in product lines that are complementary to our existing vehicle replacement parts offerings but have lower gross margins such as remanufactured engines the product mix effect was also partially generated by sales of scrap aluminum as we expanded our furnace capacity through an acquisition in august 2010 our sales of scrap aluminum which is a byproduct of our wheel refinishing operations generate lower margins than our sales of vehicle products our acquisition of ecp which generates lower gross margins than our north american business because of a greater weighting on lower margin mechanical products increased our cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue by 02 vehicle acquisition costs in our self service business grew at a greater rate than revenue as purchase costs were driven higher by increased demand for used cars and higher scrap prices while scrap metal prices declined late in 2011 average vehicle acquisition costs did not fall as suppliers continued to demand higher prices these vehicle acquisition factors caused a 05 increase in our cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue compared to 2010 these effects were partially offset by reductions in our wholesale salvage costs as a percentage of revenue as the impact of rising vehicle costs driven by higher demand for salvage vehicles was offset by our increased recovery on cores and benefits of a net increase in scrap prices over prior year levels 

facility and warehouse expenses  as a percentage of revenue facility and warehouse expenses declined to 90 of revenue in 2011 from 95 in 2010 the decrease was driven by a reduction in personnelrelated expenses as a percentage of revenue which fell to 49 compared to 53 in the prior year as we expanded our product offerings through acquisitions in complementary business lines during 2011 we were able to leverage the fixed component of facility and warehouse expenses such as personnel costs as we integrated the acquisitions into our existing business the decrease in facility and warehouse expenses as a percentage of revenue was also partially a result of higher other revenue which grew at a greater rate than personnel expenditures 

distribution expenses  distribution expenses as a percentage of revenue increased by 02 compared to 2010 as higher fuel and freight costs offset benefits from improved utilization of our distribution employees and equipment rising fuel prices increased fuel expense to 14 of revenue in 2011 compared to 12 in the prior year higher fuel prices also impacted third party freight expense which increased to 14 of revenue in 2011 from 12 in 2010 these increases were partially offset by improved leveraging of our distribution network including our personnel expenditures and equipment costs in a period of growing revenue and higher other revenue that did not require additional distribution expenditures 

selling general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenue our selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 120 in 2011 from 126 in 2010 the decline in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by improved utilization of these costs in a period of rising revenue including increased revenue from scrap metal and other metals that did not require additional selling or administrative expenditures the decrease in these costs as a percentage of revenue included a reduction in selling expenses to 68 of revenue from 71 of revenue our general and administrative expenses which include corporate overhead professional fees and information technology expenses decreased to 52 of revenue from 55 of revenue 

restructuring and acquisition related expenses  in 2011 we incurred 76 million of restructuring and acquisition related expenses compared to 07 million in 2010 our 2011 expenses include 40 million related to integrating our 2011 acquisition of the akzo nobel paint business and our 2010 acquisition of cross canada a canadian aftermarket business into our existing operations we also incurred 04 million of integration costs related to certain of our other acquisitions acquisition related expenses which consist of external costs primarily related to our acquisition of ecp effective as of october 1 2011 totaled 32 million in 2011 these acquisition related expenses included professional fees such as accounting legal advisory and valuation services restructuring charges incurred in 2010 included charges related to integration efforts from 2009 acquisitions see note 10 restructuring and acquisition related expenses  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our restructuring and integration plans 

depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization expense was 15 in both 2011 and 2010 our increased levels of property and equipment primarily driven by capital expenditures and acquisitions as well as higher intangible amortization expense were offset by leveraging of our existing facilities to grow revenue and acquisition related revenue growth respectively 

other expense net  total other expense net decreased to 257 million in 2011 from 278 million in 2010 in 2011 our net interest expense decreased by 59 million compared to 2010 which was offset by a loss on debt extinguishment of 53 million on march 25 2011 we executed a new senior secured credit agreement and as a result the unamortized balance of debt issuance costs related to the previous credit agreement was written off interest expense decreased due to a reduction in the average effective interest rate on our bank borrowings to 34 in 2011 from 49 in 2010 resulting from lower interest rates under our new credit facility combined with the impact of lower fixed interest rates under our outstanding interest rate swaps compared to the prior year we also recognized a net gain of 14 million related to adjustments to reduce the fair value estimates of our contingent consideration liabilities in 2011 we recognized a 04 million foreign exchange loss related to fluctuations in the canadian dollar the british pound and other currencies compared to a 02 million gain in the prior year 

provision for income taxes  our effective income tax rate in 2011 was 374 compared with 381 in 2010 the lower effective income tax rate in 2011 reflects a benefit of 05 relative to the prior year from our expanding international operations and a 03 reduction in our effective state tax rate our international operations which grew in 2011 with the ecp acquisition contributed to a lower effective tax rate as a larger proportion of our pretax income was generated in lower rate jurisdictions additionally we achieved tax savings from our financing of foreign acquisitions our effective state tax rate declined as a result of a shift in income to lower rate jurisdictions the effective income tax rate for the comparable prior year period included a discrete benefit of 15 million resulting primarily from the revaluation of deferred taxes in connection with a legal entity reorganization while we had no individually significant discrete items in 2011 the total benefit recognized for the year was similar to the benefit from the legal entity reorganization in 2010 

income from discontinued operations net of taxes  income from discontinued operations net of taxes was 20 million in 2010 which was primarily the result of a gain of 27 million 17 million net of tax from the sale of two self service retail facilities on january 15 2010 our 2011 results do not include any impact from these discontinued operations as the facilities were closed or sold in the first quarter of 2010

we have three operating segments wholesale—north america wholesale—europe and self service our operations in north america which include our wholesale—north america and self service operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services customers and methods of distribution while we believe our wholesale—europe operating segment shares many of the characteristics of our north american operations we have provided separate financial information as we believe this data would be beneficial to users in understanding our results 

the following table presents our financial performance including revenue and earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization “ebitda” by reportable segment for the periods indicated in thousands 

  



  

 the key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker is ebitda segment ebitda includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment corporate and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment’s percentage of consolidated revenue segment ebitda excludes depreciation amortization interest including loss on debt extinguishment and taxes loss on debt extinguishment is considered a component of interest in calculating ebitda as the writeoff of debt issuance costs is similar to the treatment of debt issuance cost amortization see note 15 segment and geographic information  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a reconciliation of total ebitda to income from continuing operations 

since we presented a single reportable segment north america until the acquisition of ecp effective october 1 2011 our european segment does not have a full comparative prior year period for the year ended december 31 2012  therefore the discussion of the consolidated results of operations covers the factors driving the year over year performance of our north american segment and includes the effect of the european results of operations on our consolidated results compared to the year ended december 31 2011 including the ninemonth unaudited preacquisition period ecp achieved revenue and ebitda growth of 28  and 30  respectively during the year ended   december 31 2012  the growth in our european segment was primarily a result of higher sales volumes at existing branches with additional revenue contributed by new branches as well ecp continued to expand its branch network by opening 40 new branches in the uk in 2012 

2013 outlook 

we estimate that net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ending december 31 2013 excluding the impact of any restructuring and acquisition related expenses and any gains or losses related to acquisitions or divestitures including changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities will be in the range of 305 million to 330 million and 100 to 109 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of ongoing liquidity are cash flows from our operations and our credit agreement our credit agreement which was executed on march 25 2011 and subsequently amended and restated on september 30 2011 provides for total borrowings of up to 14 billion consisting of a 950 million revolving credit facility including up to 500 million available in foreign currencies and up to 450 million of term loan borrowings in 2012 we borrowed 200 million of 

available term loans under the credit agreement which were used to pay down a portion of our outstanding revolving credit facility borrowings as of december 31 2012  the outstanding obligations under the credit agreement totaled 9746 million  composed of 4206 million  of term loans and 5540 million  of revolver borrowings after giving effect to outstanding letters of credit our availability under the revolving credit facility at december 31 2012  was 3561 million  we do not expect to utilize the revolver as a primary source of funding for working capital needs as we expect our cash flows from operations to be sufficient for that purpose but we do maintain availability as we continue to expand our facilities and network cash and equivalents at december 31 2012  totaled 598 million  

borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at variable rates which depend on the currency and the duration of the borrowing plus an applicable margin rate the weightedaverage interest rate on borrowings outstanding against our credit agreement at december 31 2012  after giving effect to the interest rate swap contracts in force described in note 6 derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k was 285  of our outstanding credit agreement borrowings of 9746 million  and 9014 million  at december 31 2012 and 2011  319 million  and 125 million  were classified as current maturities respectively the increase in the current portion of outstanding credit agreement borrowings was a result of the draw of the additional 200 million term loan in january 2012 combined with higher term loan payments beginning in 2013 

on september 28 2012 we entered into a three year receivables securitization facility with bank of tokyomitsubishi ufj ltd btmu which we expect will provide borrowing capacity at lower commercial paper rates and assist us in maintaining availability under the revolving credit facility as we continue to expand our business organically and through acquisitions at the end of the initial three year term the financial institutions party to the agreement may elect to renew their commitments and thereby extend the agreement under the terms of the securitization facility certain of our subsidiaries the originators sell certain of their trade receivables to a bankruptcyremote special purpose wholly owned subsidiary lkq receivables finance company llc lrfc which in turn sells an ownership interest in the receivables on a revolving basis to btmu for the benefit of conduit investors for up to 80 million in cash proceeds upon payment of the receivables by customers rather than remitting to btmu the amounts collected lrfc has reinvested and will reinvest such receivables payments to purchase additional receivables from the originators subject to the originators generating sufficient eligible receivables to sell to lrfc in replacement of collected balances as the receivables are held by lrfc a separate bankruptcyremote corporate entity they are available first to satisfy the creditors of lrfc the initial proceeds of 773 million were used for the repayment of outstanding revolver borrowings under the credit agreement as of december 31 2012  the outstanding balance under the receivables securitization facility was 80 million  with a borrowing rate of 105  

the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds we normally pay for aftermarket product purchases at the time of shipment or on standard payment terms depending on the manufacturer and the negotiated payment terms our purchases of aftermarket products totaled approximately 13 billion  8363 million  and 5767 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively the increase in aftermarket inventory purchases was primarily driven by our fourth quarter 2011 acquisition of ecp which contributed 4403 million  and 857 million  during 2012 and 2011 respectively we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under some direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles we acquired approximately 254000  228000  and 198000  wholesale salvage vehicles and 8200  6000  and 4000  heavy and mediumduty trucks in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively in addition we acquired approximately 416000  352000  and 297000  lower cost self service and crush only vehicles in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

net cash provided by operating activities  totaled 2062 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to 2118 million  in 2011  in 2012 our ebitda increased by 925 million  compared to the prior year due to both acquisition related growth and organic growth the increase in ebitda was partially offset by a 437 million  greater cash outflow for accounts payable as we accelerated payments to take advantage of prompt pay discounts resulting in a decrease in days payable outstanding in 2012 compared to 2011 in 2012 we also made 330 million  of higher income tax payments compared to the prior year as a result of greater pretax earnings due to higher outstanding debt levels cash payments for interest exceeded payments in the prior year period by 77 million  prepayments for insurance policies and payroll taxes increased by 73 million over the prior year due to additional insurance policies and the timing of payroll tax payments for our european operations acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011 the year ended   december 31 2012  reflected higher bonus payments of 18 million compared to the prior year as well as 59 million of incremental payments under our long term incentive plan

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 2118 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to 1592 million  in 2010  in 2011  our ebitda increased by 782 million  compared to the prior year period due to both acquisition related growth and organic growth additionally our cash interest payments were 61 million lower than the prior year period due primarily to lower effective interest rates under our current secured credit agreement these increases were partially offset by 251 million in higher tax payments primarily driven by the increase in pretax income and a higher net investment in our primary working capital accounts receivables inventory and payables the net cash outflow for our primary working capital accounts increased to 796 million for the year ended december 31 2011  from 699 million for the comparable prior year period primarily due to increased inventory purchases partially offset by the timing of cash payments and collections 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 5716 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to 1916 million  for the same period of 2010  we invested 4869 million of cash net of cash acquired in 21  acquisitions during 2011 including 2937 million  of cash paid net of cash acquired for our acquisition of ecp cash payments net of cash acquired for our 20  acquisitions in 2010  totaled 1436 million  in january 2010 we completed the sale of two of our self service yards resulting in a cash inflow net of cash sold of 120 million property and equipment purchases were 864 million  in the year ended december 31 2011  which is 250 million greater than the property and equipment purchases in 2010 the growth in capital expenditures was driven by an increase in site improvement and capacity expansion projects compared to the prior year as well as expenditures related to planned 2010 projects that carried over into 2011 

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 3114 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to 190 million  in 2010  in march 2011 we entered into our senior secured credit agreement under which our initial draw of 5918 million was used to pay off amounts outstanding under the previous credit facility the credit agreement was amended and restated effective september 30 2011 to provide additional capacity under our revolving credit facility under which we drew 3256 million to fund our acquisition of ecp in the fourth quarter additionally we made three scheduled term loan payments totaling 94 million in 2011 related to the execution and subsequent amendment of our credit agreement we paid 110 million of debt issuance costs during the prior year we had only one required quarterly term loan payment for 75 million due to prepayments made in 2009 cash generated from exercises of stock options provided 119 million  and 140 million  in 2011  and 2010  respectively the excess tax benefit from sharebased payment arrangements reduced income taxes payable by 80 million  and 150 million  in 2011  and 2010  respectively 

as part of the consideration for certain of our business acquisitions we entered into contingent consideration agreements with the selling shareholders under the terms of the contingent consideration agreements additional payments will be made to the former owners if specified future events occur or conditions are met such as meeting profitability or earnings targets for our acquisition of ecp we are required to pay up to an additional 89 million £55 million in the event the business achieves certain ebitda targets during the years ending december 31 2012 and 2013 based on our evaluation of the likelihood of meeting these performance targets we recorded a liability for the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration of 775 million   £502 million  the acquisition date fair value of our other contingent consideration liabilities totaled 55 million  37 million  and 20 million  for acquisitions completed in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively as of december 31 2012  the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities was 900 million  which included a liability for the maximum payment of 406 million £25 million related to the 2012 performance period of the ecp contingent payment agreement we expect to fund these payments through either cash generated from operations or through draws on our revolving credit facility in addition to these contingent consideration agreements we issued promissory notes in connection with our business acquisitions totaling approximately 160 million  342 million  and 55 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively the notes bear interest at annual rates of 10  to 40  and interest is payable at maturity or in monthly installments 

we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of distribution centers processing and sales facilities and warehouses through further integration of our facilities and through selected business acquisitions our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including the costs and 

timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions our credit agreement and recently executed receivables facility provide additional sources of liquidity to fund acquisitions which we expect will support our strategy to supplement our organic growth with acquisitions 

we believe that our current cash and equivalents cash provided by operating activities and funds available from bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements although such sources may not be sufficient for future acquisitions depending on their size from time to time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements there can be no assurance that additional funding or refinancing of our credit facility if needed will be available on terms attractive to us or at all furthermore any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

2013 outlook 

we estimate that our capital expenditures for 2013 excluding business acquisitions will be between 100 million and 115 million we expect to use these funds for several major facility expansions improvement of current facilities real estate acquisitions and systems development projects maintenance or replacement capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 20 of the total for 2013 we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities for 2013 will be approximately 300 million 

offbalance sheet arrangements and future commitments 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements or undisclosed borrowings or debt that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to item 303 of regulation sk under the securities exchange act of 1934 additionally we do not have any synthetic leases

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facility where interest rates are tied to the prime rate the london interbank offered rate or the canadian dealer offered rate in march 2008 we implemented a policy to manage our exposure to variable interest rates on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt instruments through the use of interest rate swap contracts these contracts convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt matching effective and maturity dates to specific debt instruments all of our interest rate swap contracts have been executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy jpmorgan chase bank na bank of america na and rbs citizens na and are denominated in currency that matches the underlying debt instrument net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swap contracts will be included as adjustments to interest expense as of december 31 2012  we held seven interest rate swap contracts representing a total of 520 million of us dollardenominated notional amount debt £50 million of pound sterlingdenominated notional amount debt and cad 25 million of canadian dollardenominated notional amount debt in total we had 64 and 69 of our variable rate debt under our credit facility at fixed rates at december 31 2012 and 2011  respectively these swaps have maturity dates ranging from october 2013 through december 2016 these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and modify the variable rate nature of that portion of our variable rate debt as of december 31 2012  the fair market value of these swaps was a liability of 156 million the values of such contracts are subject to changes in interest rates 

at december 31 2012  we had 428 million of variable rate debt that was not hedged including 800 million  of outstanding debt under the receivables securitization facility which bears interest based on commercial paper rates using sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of a 100 basis point movement in the interest rates interest expense would change by 4 million over the next twelve months to the extent that we have cash investments earning interest a portion of the increase in interest expense resulting from a variable rate change would be mitigated by higher interest income 

we are also exposed to market risk related to price fluctuations in scrap metal and other metals market prices of these metals affect the amount that we pay for our inventory as well as the revenue that we generate from sales of these metals as both our revenue and costs are affected by the price fluctuations we have a natural hedge against the changes however there is typically a lag between the effect on our revenue from metal price fluctuations and inventory cost changes therefore we can experience positive or negative gross margin effects in periods of rising or falling metal prices particularly when such prices move rapidly if market prices were to fall at a greater rate than our vehicle acquisition costs we could experience a decline in gross margin as of december 31 2012  we held shortterm metals forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in metals prices specifically related to our precious metals refining and reclamation business acquired in the second quarter of 2012 the notional amount and fair value of these forward contracts at december 31 2012  were immaterial 

additionally we are exposed to currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket products from foreign countries the majority of our foreign inventory purchases are from manufacturers based in taiwan while our transactions with manufacturers based in taiwan are conducted in us dollars changes in the relationship between the us dollar and the taiwan dollar might impact the purchase price of aftermarket products our aftermarket operations in canada which also purchase inventory from taiwan in us dollars are further subject to changes in the relationship between the us 

dollar and the canadian dollar our aftermarket operations in the uk also source a portion of their inventory from taiwan as well as from other european countries and china resulting in exposure to changes in the relationship of the pound sterling against the euro and the us dollar with our acquisition of euro car parts holdings limited in the fourth quarter of 2011 we began hedging our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations for certain of our purchases for our uk operations the notional amount and fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2012  were immaterial we do not currently attempt to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in our north american operations and we may not be able to pass on any price increases to our customers 

foreign currency fluctuations may also impact the financial results we report for the portions of our business that operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar our operations in the uk and other countries represented 22  of our revenue in 2012 an increase or decrease in the strength of the us dollar against these currencies by 10 would result in a 2  change in our consolidated revenue and operating income for the year ended   december 31 2012  

other than with respect to a portion of our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in the uk we do not hold derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency risk our net investment in foreign operations is partially hedged by the foreign currency denominated borrowings we use to fund foreign acquisitions additionally we have elected not to hedge the foreign currency risk related to the interest payments on these borrowings as we generate pound sterling and canadian dollar cash flows that can be used to fund debt payments as of december 31 2012  we have amounts outstanding under our revolver facility denominated in pounds sterling of £875 million 1422 million and canadian dollars of cad 1100 million 1108 million

 item 1 business tableend overview 

lkq corporation “lkq” or the “company” provides replacement parts components and systems needed to repair vehicles cars and trucks buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers “oems” which are commonly known as oem products new products produced by companies other than the oems which are sometimes referred to as “aftermarket” products recycled products originally produced by oems which we refer to as recycled products used products that have been refurbished and used products that have been remanufactured 

we distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops including aftermarket collision and mechanical products recycled collision and mechanical products refurbished collision replacement products such as wheels bumper covers and lights and remanufactured engines collectively we refer to our products as alternative parts we are the nation’s largest provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and a leading provider of alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products our sales processing and distribution facilities reach most major markets in the us and canada we expanded our wholesale operations effective october 1 2011 with our acquisition of euro car parts holdings limited “ecp” the largest distributor of automotive aftermarket products in the united kingdom in addition to our wholesale operations we operate self service retail facilities that sell recycled automotive products we also sell recycled heavyduty truck products and used heavyduty trucks we have organized our businesses into four operating segments wholesale—north america wholesale—europe self service and heavyduty truck 

we obtain the majority of our aftermarket inventory from auto parts manufacturers and distributors based in the us taiwan europe and china we procure recycled automotive products mainly by purchasing salvage vehicles typically severely damaged by collisions and primarily sold at salvage auctions or pools and then dismantling and inventorying the parts the refurbished and remanufactured products that we sell such as wheels bumper covers lights and engines originate from parts from the salvage vehicles bought at auctions parts received in trade at collision shops purchasing replacement products from us and damaged parts bought through bulk purchases from core sales companies that collect damaged parts 

the majority of our products and services are sold to collision repair shops also known as body shops and mechanical repair shops we indirectly rely on insurance companies which ultimately pay for the majority of collision repairs of insured vehicles to help drive demand insurance companies tend to exert significant influence in the vehicle repair decision because of their importance to the process we have formed business relationships with certain insurance companies in north america in which we are designated a preferred products supplier and we are in the process of establishing business relationships with certain insurance companies in europe 

  

we provide customers with a value proposition that includes high quality products at lower cost than new oem products extensive product availability due to our expansive distribution network and responsive service and quick delivery the breadth of our alternative parts offerings allows us to serve as a “onestop” solution for our customers looking for the most cost effective way to provide quality repairs 

we strive to be environmentally responsible our recycled automotive products provide an alternative to the manufacture of new products which would require the expenditure of significantly more resources and energy and would generate a substantial amount of additional pollution in addition we save landfill space because the parts that we recycle would otherwise be discarded we also collect materials such as metals plastics fuel and motor oil from the salvage vehicles that we procure and use them in our operations or sell them to other users 

history 

since our formation in 1998 we have grown through internal development and over 130 acquisitions today lkq is the only supplier of aftermarket and recycled automobile products for the collision and mechanical repair industry with a network and presence spanning the us and canada with our acquisition of ecp in 2011 we are also the largest supplier of automotive aftermarket products reaching most major markets in the uk 

initially formed through the combination of a number of wholesale recycled products businesses located in florida michigan ohio and wisconsin lkq grew to be a leading source for recycled auto collision and mechanical products we subsequently expanded through acquisitions of aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured product suppliers and manufacturers and also expanded into the self service retail business and heavyduty truck industry the most significant increase to our business was through the acquisition of keystone automotive industries inc in october 2007 which at the time of acquisition was the leading domestic distributor of aftermarket products including collision replacement products paint products refurbished steel bumpers bumper covers and alloy wheels 

effective october 1 2011 we acquired ecp which marks our entry into the european automotive aftermarket business ecp operates out of 90 branches supported by eight regional hubs and a national distribution center from which multiple deliveries are made each day ecp’s product offerings are primarily focused on automotive aftermarket mechanical products many of which are sourced from the same suppliers that provide products to the oems the expansion of our geographic presence beyond north america into the european market offers an opportunity to us as that market has historically had a low penetration of alternative collision parts 

in addition to our acquisition of ecp we made 20 acquisitions in north america in 2011 12 wholesale businesses five recycled heavyduty truck products businesses and three self service retail operations our acquisitions included the purchase of two engine remanufacturers which expanded our presence in the remanufacturing industry that we entered in 2010 additionally our acquisition of an automotive heating and cooling component distributor supplements our expansion into the automotive heating and cooling aftermarket products market our north american wholesale business acquisitions also included the purchase of the us vehicle refinish paint distribution business of akzo nobel automotive and aerospace coatings the “akzo nobel paint business” which allowed us to increase our paint and related product offerings and expand our geographic presence in the automotive paint market our other 2011 acquisitions enabled us to expand our geographic presence and enter new markets 

we expect to make additional strategic acquisitions in 2012 as we continue to build an integrated distribution network offering a broad range of alternative parts 

strategy 

we are focused on creating economic value for our stockholders by enhancing our position as a leading source for alternative collision and mechanical repair products and by expanding into other product lines and 

  

businesses that may benefit from our operating strengths such as the engine remanufacturing business we believe a supply network with a broad inventory of quality alternative collision and mechanical repair products high fulfillment rates and superior customer service will provide us with a competitive advantage other than oems the competition in the markets that we serve is extremely fragmented and the supply of products tends to be localized often leading to low fulfillment rates particularly with recycled products in north america the distribution channels for aftermarket and refurbished products have historically been distinct and separate from those for recycled and remanufactured products despite serving the same customer segment we provide value to our customers by bringing these two channels together to provide a broader product offering to execute our strategy we are expanding our network of dismantling plants and warehouses in major metropolitan areas and employing a distribution system that allows for order fulfillment from regional warehouses located across the us and canada by increasing local inventory levels and expanding our network to provide timely access to a greater range of parts we have increased fulfillment rates beyond the levels that we believe most of our competitors realize particularly for recycled products we believe opportunities exist beyond our north american operations to introduce the benefits of an integrated distribution network that supplies alternative parts our acquisition of ecp is expected to provide a platform to execute our strategy in the uk 

sources of high quality reliable alternatives to oem products are important to insurance companies and to our direct customers as they seek to control repair costs lower parts costs and quicker completion of orders save money and reduce cycle times we believe this strategy is applicable to both the automobile and heavyduty truck markets in order to execute this strategy and build on our progress thus far we will continue to seek to expand into new markets and to improve penetration both organically and through acquisitions in targeted markets 

national network in place 

lkq has invested significant capital to develop a network of alternative parts facilities across the us and canada the difficulty and time required to obtain proper zoning as well as dismantling and other environmental permits necessary to operate newlysited recycled product facilities would make establishing a new network of locations a challenge for a competitor in addition there are difficulties associated with recruiting and hiring an experienced management team that has strong industry knowledge 

we believe there are growth opportunities in new primary and secondary markets in the us and canada we intend to expand our market coverage through a combination of internal development and acquisitions in new regions and adjacent markets our broad network allows us to initially enter new adjacent markets by establishing local redistribution facilities avoiding the need for significant upfront capital outlays to establish local dismantling capabilities and inventories 

our acquisition of ecp in the fourth quarter of 2011 provides us with an established distribution network reaching most major markets in the uk similar to the development of lkq’s north american business we believe this network provides an ideal platform to us as we explore opportunities to expand into new markets and complementary product lines in europe 

strong business relationships 

we have developed business relationships with automobile insurance companies collision and mechanical repair shops suppliers and other industry participants we believe that insurance companies as payers for many repairs are increasingly taking more active roles in the selection of alternative replacement products for vehicle repairs in order to contain the repair portion of the claims costs on behalf of certain insurance companies we provide a review of vehicle repair estimates so they may assess the opportunity to increase usage of alternative products in the repair process thereby reducing their costs our employees also provide quotes for our products to assist several insurance companies with their estimate and settlement processes we also work with insurance companies and vehicle manufacturers to procure salvage vehicles directly from them on a selected basis which 

  

provides us with an additional source of supply and offers lower transaction costs to sellers of low value salvage vehicles we believe we are positioned to take advantage of the increasing importance these industry participants have in the repair process and will continue to look for ways to enhance our relationships with them 

we provide quality assurance programs that offer additional product support to auto insurance companies these product support programs identify specific subsets of aftermarket products by vendor and product type that can be used in the repair of vehicles that these companies insure the programs typically offer aftermarket products that have been produced by manufacturers certified by a third party testing lab we may provide additional validation of the quality of the products beyond our standard warranties and identification details that make the products traceable back to a manufacturer’s specific production run 

to strengthen our relationship with collision shops we have developed “keyless” a program that enables collision repair shops to link their estimating systems with our aftermarket and recycled inventory it is compatible with all of the major estimating systems and provides realtime inventory availability the system encourages the use of alternative products by indicating to the collision shop the availability of applicable alternative products at the time of the estimate it also provides demand information to our purchasing department and offers sales leads for our sales representatives 

technology driven business processes 

we focus on technology development as a way to support our competitive advantage we believe that we can more cost effectively leverage our data to make better business decisions than our smaller competitors we continue to develop our technology to better manage and analyze our inventory assist our salespeople with uptodate pricing and availability of our products and further enhance our inventory procurement process for example our bidding specialists responsible for procuring vehicles are equipped with handheld computing devices that compare the vehicles at the salvage auctions to our current inventory historical demand and recent average prices to arrive at an estimated maximum bid this bidding system reduces the likelihood of purchasing unneeded parts that might result in obsolete inventory 

we deploy inventory management systems at our facilities that are similar to those used by leading distribution companies we make extensive use of bar code technology and wireless data transmission to track parts from the time a vehicle or product arrives at a facility to its placement on a truck for delivery to the customer in 2010 we completed the implementation of our lkq x software program at our domestic locations lkq x is a proprietary program that provides our sales representatives with information on availability of aftermarket inventory as well as recycled inventory to better address our wholesale customers’ alternative parts needs and improve our fulfillment rates also in 2010 we completed the implementation of a yard management system for our heavyduty truck operations this system provides visibility across our plants allowing for improved sales by reducing lost sales due to stockouts in 2011 we completed the implementation of a standardized point of sale system for our self service locations through increased visibility to parts sales across the network we have been able to respond more quickly to changes in demand and leverage our visibility to price changes across our self service locations our newly acquired wholesale business in the uk uses an integrated inventory management system that provides uptotheminute information on available stock by location to ensure availability of highdemand inventory based on daily sales activity the system directs the needed overnight deliveries to replenish stock levels among the national distribution center hubs and branch locations 

demand driven procurement 

we believe efficient procurement of aftermarket products and salvage vehicles is critical to the growth of the operating results and cash flow of our business we use information systems and proprietary methodologies to help us identify high demand aftermarket and recycled products our aftermarket inventory systems track products sold and sales lost due to a lack of inventory and make purchase recommendations the inventory 

  

systems also recommend purchases and transfers based on the extent and location of demand our buying team reviews the recommendations and places orders accordingly when we procure aftermarket products or refurbish collision replacement products such as wheels bumper covers and lights we focus on products that are in the most demand by the insured repair market our most popular aftermarket products are collision replacement products such as hoods and fenders head lamps tail lamps and bumper covers because lead times may take 45 days or more on imported products sales volume and instock inventory are important factors in the procurement process 

our information systems prioritize and recommend bid prices of the salvage vehicles we evaluate for purchase our processes and systems help to identify with a high degree of accuracy the value of the parts that can be recycled on a salvage vehicle and recommend a maximum purchase price to achieve our target profitability from the resale of the recycled products we also use historical sales records of vehicles by model and year to estimate the demand for our products combining this information with proprietary data that aggregate customer requests for products we are able to source aftermarket products and salvage vehicles at prices that we believe will allow us to sell products profitably 

high fulfillment rates 

we have increased local inventory levels and found that it has improved our customer service and allowed for faster deliveries improving local order fulfillment rates reduces transfer costs and delivery times and improves customer satisfaction our ability to share inventory on a regional basis increases the availability of replacement products and also helps us to fill a higher percentage of our customers’ requests we have developed regional trading zones within which we make our inventory available to our local facilities mostly via overnight product transfers we manage our purchasing and recycled product inventory on a regional basis to enhance the availability of the products that we believe will be in the highest demand within each region we believe that our higher than industry average fulfillment rates distinguish us from our competition 

broad product offering 

the breadth and depth of our inventory reinforces lkq’s ability to provide a “onestop” solution for our customers’ alternative vehicle replacement product needs customers place a high value on the availability of a broad range of vehicle replacement products we are able to provide the collision and mechanical repair industry with premium products at costs typically 20 to 50 below new oem replacement products the availability of alternative products means that automobiles can be repaired at lower costs and contributes to cars being repaired rather than designated as ‘total losses’ by insurance companies in fact many insurance companies in north america will not authorize the use of higher cost new oem replacement products if alternative products are available our ability to supply these products gives insurance companies the confidence to designate lkq as the preferred supplier for their repair shops with our distribution network that reaches the major markets in the us and canada combined with our extensive range of products we believe we are the only supplier that is able to support the insurance industry in this manner we believe we will be positioned to provide similar services to the insurance industry in the uk as we expand our collision product offerings and continue to build the national distribution network of our recently acquired uk operations 

our aftermarket product offering is particularly broad with more than 86000 skus sold in north america in 2011 in order to address the multiple needs of our aftermarket customers we offer our platinum plus line of high quality products with lifetime warranties our value line of aftermarket products when cost is the main factor for vehicle repairs and products certified by independent organizations such as the certified automotive parts association “capa” and nsf international “nsf” our 2011 acquisition of the akzo nobel paint business allowed us to expand our geographic range in aftermarket automotive paint to better meet our customers’ repair needs we also offer other repair materials such as tape sandpaper paint guns and frame racks so that our customers can purchase these at the same time as they are ordering their automotive repair 

  

products our uk operations also offer a broad range of products with more than 121000 individual skus sold in 2011 

one call away 

to execute our strategy of offering a broad inventory with high fulfillment rates we offer our customers the choice of aftermarket or recycled products for many parts we also offer refurbished or remanufactured product options if for example a customer has a damaged bumper we may offer that customer the choice of a recycled bumper a new aftermarket bumper or a refurbished bumper because recycled products are in limited supply our ability to offer additional alternative product options increases our fulfillment rates and customer satisfaction historically the distribution channels for aftermarket and refurbished products have been separate from those for recycled and remanufactured products however we are combining these channels through the sharing of warehousing inventory sales and distribution systems so that our repair shop customers need only one source of supply for their alternative repair products 

wholesale auto products—north america 

our wholesale automobile product operations in north america are organized by geographic regions serving the us and canada that sell all four product types to collision and mechanical automobile repair businesses as of december 31 2011 these wholesale operations conducted business from more than 290 facilities 

as we have combined the distribution channels for our alternative parts offerings we also leverage our facility and warehouse costs and improve local product availability by locating multiple product operations together our aftermarket product operations may include a combination of sales warehousing and distribution and in many cases will be colocated with our refurbishing operations our salvage operations typically have processing sales distribution and administrative operations on site indoor and outdoor storage areas and include a large warehouse with multiple bays to dismantle vehicles our engine remanufacturing operations which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2010 and in 2011 are conducted primarily at our facility in mexico with sales warehousing and distribution operations in the us 

wholesale aftermarket products 

our 2011 sales included more than 86000 skus of aftermarket collision products and repair materials for the most common models of domestic and foreign automobiles and light trucks generally for the 15 most recent model years our principal aftermarket product types consist of those most frequently damaged in collisions including automotive body panels bumper covers and lights in 2011 our expansion in complementary product types such as cooling products and paint contributed to the increase in our available products and has allowed us to better meet our customers’ repair needs the sources for our aftermarket products are both foreign and domestic manufacturers and distributors 

aftermarket products provide the collision repair industry with quality products at prices well below new oem replacement products lower costs may help insurers contain collision repair costs and may result in cars being considered repairable rather than categorized as total losses 

we distribute paint and other materials used in repairing damaged vehicles including sandpaper abrasives masking products and plastic filler the paint and other materials distributed by us are purchased from numerous suppliers in the us and canada certain of these products are distributed under the brand “keystone” 

platinum plus is our exclusive brand offered in the keystone product line of aftermarket products it offers high quality products at lower costs than new oem replacement products the platinum plus products are held to high quality standards and tested by quality teams we provide a warranty for as long as a consumer owns the vehicle on which the product was installed many of our platinum plus products are used for repairs that are ultimately paid for by insurance companies and are part of our quality assurance programs 

  

capa and nsf are associations that evaluate the functional equivalence of aftermarket collision replacement products to oem collision replacement products members of capa and nsf include insurance companies product distributors including lkq collision repair shops and consumers capa and nsf develop engineering specifications for aftermarket collision replacement products based upon examinations of oem products certify the factories manufacturing processes and quality control procedures used by independent manufacturers and certify the materials fit and finish of specific aftermarket collision replacement products 

in 2011 lkq became the first automotive parts distributor to become certified under the new nsf international automotive parts distributor certification program which addresses the needs of collision repair shops and insurers by maintaining quality management systems to address part traceability service and quality this certification program complements the existing parts certification program with nsf under which lkq has a broad range of certified automotive collision replacement parts many major insurance companies have adopted policies recommending or requiring the use of products certified by capa or nsf when available a number of capa and nsf certified products are also marketed under the platinum plus brand 

in addition to distributing parts certified by capa and nsf we actively participate with capa nsf insurance companies and consumer groups in encouraging independent manufacturers of collision replacement products to seek certifications from these organizations 

we have developed a product line called “value line” for more value conscious often selfpay consumers our value line products offer quality products at reasonable prices providing additional choices for repairs or rebuilding of vehicles the value line product line includes most product categories 

procurement of inventory 

the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from independent manufacturers and distributors located primarily in the us and taiwan in 2011 approximately 53 of our aftermarket purchases were made from our top eight vendors with our largest vendor providing approximately 12 of our inventory we believe we are one of the largest customers of each of these suppliers no other supplier provided more than 5 of our supply of aftermarket products we purchased approximately 44 of our aftermarket products directly from manufacturers in taiwan and other asian countries approximately 56 of our aftermarket products were purchased from vendors located in the us and canada however we believe the majority of these products were manufactured in taiwan mexico or other foreign countries 

we benefit from an automated procurement system for aftermarket goods that makes order and inventory transfer recommendations using product sales and data for lost sales due to stockouts buyers review the system’s recommendations and then place purchase orders or arrange for a redistribution of inventory to areas of higher demand for new products we use vehicle volume and registrations by state to influence what new products should be ordered and where the stock should be located typically six months after the products are introduced the automated system has sufficient data to make order recommendations 

we have business arrangements with manufacturers to produce our platinum plus products these agreements automatically renew for additional 12 month periods unless written notice is given while we compete with other distributors for production capacity we believe that our sources of supply and our relationships with our suppliers are satisfactory 

we usually receive orders within ten days from domestic suppliers orders placed with foreign manufacturers generally are received within 45 to 60 days 

foreign orders typically are shipped in sea containers directly to over half of our aftermarket locations we have 24 regional hubs and three distribution centers the hub warehouses act as sources for our other noncontainerdirect aftermarket warehouse locations and serve as the central stocking point of all slower moving items this structure is designed to maximize our fulfillment rates as smaller branches can have a high fillrate of next day availability 

  

wholesale recycled products 

wholesale recycled collision and mechanical products provide high quality lowerprice repair options our most popular recycled products include engines transmissions doors front end assemblies trunk lids bumper assemblies head and tail lamp assemblies and mirrors some insurance companies mandate that the recycled products must be of the same model year or newer as the vehicle being repaired as a result the majority of the products we sell are from vehicles not more than ten years of age we have adopted the industry’s grading system based on the condition of the product and factor product grades into our pricing decisions unlike aftermarket products that are individually boxed recycled products are most frequently sold as subassemblies or as multiple parts already put together installing recycled products often means that collision shops not only save on product cost but because several products may come preassembled are also able to reduce labor costs 

procurement of inventory 

we procure recycled products for our wholesale operations by acquiring damaged or totaled vehicles vehicles that have been declared “total losses” typically are sold at regional salvage auctions throughout the us and canada salvage auctions charge fees both to the suppliers of vehicles primarily insurance companies and to the purchasers such as lkq additionally we pay third parties fees to tow the vehicles from the auction to our facilities 

over the past few years the frequency with which vehicles are declared total losses has increased as a result¸ we believe of the rise in repair costs relative to replacement cost in 2000 approximately 9 of accident claims resulted in a total loss by 2010 this percentage increased to 14 as oems offer models that have increasingly complex safety measures such as multiple airbags and vehicle operating sensors the cost to repair such vehicles has risen recently high used car values have reduced the effect of this trend slightly 

in 2011 lkq acquired approximately 228000 salvage vehicles for our wholesale recycled product operations with approximately 95 purchased at salvage auctions prior to the scheduled auction date our salvage buyers may preview the auctions online to investigate the vehicles to be sold and determine our interest in buying them they obtain key information such as the model and mileage and perform visual damage assessments to determine which parts on the targeted vehicles are recyclable with the data from this preview we deploy a bidding system that performs a valuation calculation for each vehicle in order to recommend a maximum bid price the calculation incorporates demand for a vehicle’s recyclable parts current inventory levels average selling prices auction costs projected margins and instances of outofstock using this disciplined supply and demand procurement approach we place bids on the targeted vehicles in most cases we attend auctions in person although some of our purchasing is done through an online auction system 

we acquired approximately 5 of the salvage vehicles we purchased for wholesale parts in 2011 directly from insurance companies vehicle manufacturers and other direct sellers these arrangements eliminate the fees charged to the buyers and sellers by the salvage auction often providing inventory with a lower initial expenditure of capital direct purchase agreements while usually beneficial have limited applicability to our procurement because vehicle auctions provide us with the flexibility to focus on sought after vehicles based on our bidding algorithms 

vehicle processing 

vehicle processing for our wholesale recycled operations involves dismantling a salvage vehicle into recycled products that are ready for sale when a salvage vehicle arrives at one of our facilities an inventory specialist identifies catalogs and schedules the vehicle for dismantling prior to dismantling we remove from each vehicle its fluids freon and parts containing hazardous substances or precious metals such as catalytic converters the extracted fluids are stored in bulk and subsequently sold to recyclers in the case of gasoline the fuel retrieved is primarily used to power our delivery vehicles a small portion of the recycled motor oil we collect is used at certain of our plants that have highefficiency oil burning furnaces the balance is sold to motor oil recyclers 

  

when ready for dismantling each vehicle will have an inventory report that indicates to the dismantler which parts should be removed and placed in a warehouse for future sales to customers which parts should be collected in bulk for our refurbishing and remanufacturing operations or for sale to parts remanufacturers and which parts have value but should remain on the vehicle until sold 

products that are placed directly on our shelves are typically higher sales volume items such as engines transmissions doors hoods trunk lids head and tail lamp assemblies and front and rear bumper covers many of the recycled products we sell are subassemblies of multiple parts including quarter panels and front end assemblies the subassemblies are cut from the vehicle bodies usually using specific parameters provided by the repair shop at the time of sale 

parts that are not in a condition to be sold as recycled products or that are in surplus supply are separated and refurbished or remanufactured internally or otherwise sold in bulk to parts remanufacturers if there is strong demand for products that are currently at high stock levels in our warehouses we may choose to hold the vehicle for further dismantling at some future date when we are more likely to have a need for the parts the holding period for partially dismantled car bodies will depend on the rack space available at the site once all of the parts of value have been removed the remaining vehicle frame is crushed and sold to scrap processors 

prior to placement on our warehouse shelves each inventory item is given a unique bar code tag for identification and entered into our inventory tracking system we utilize bar coding systems and wireless transmission to keep track of inventory from the time a product is removed and inventoried to the time it is sold and put on a truck for delivery 

refurbished and remanufactured products 

as of december 31 2011 we operated 34 plastic bumper and bumper cover refurbishing plants a chrome bumper plating plant 15 wheel plants one light refurbishing plant and four engine remanufacturing facilities most of our refurbished and remanufactured products are sold through our wholesale distribution channels the balance is sold to retail automotive stores wholesale distributors and via internet sales 

the majority of our refurbished and remanufactured products are processed from cores obtained from salvage vehicles purchased by our recycled operations damaged cores collected by our route delivery drivers from vehicles under repair by our customers and from core brokers our sales capacity for these products is limited by the availability of cores to refurbish in addition to the engines we remanufacture inhouse we sell some remanufactured mechanical products such as engines and transmissions acquired from other mechanical remanufacturers 

we began our engine remanufacturing operations through an acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2010 and further expanded these operations with two additional acquisitions in 2011 when identifying the products that we refurbish or remanufacture we focus on products that have high demand these products are accumulated from our salvage operations at our central core sorting facility and are then either sent to our refurbishing or remanufacturing facilities or sold in bulk to other mechanical remanufacturers additionally certain of our wheels may be sent to our smelter operations to be melted and sold as aluminum ingot 

scrap and other materials 

our wholesale recycled product operations generate scrap metal and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that have been dismantled for recycled products and “crush only” end of life vehicles acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site in other cases we will hire mobile crushing equipment to crush the vehicles before they are transported to shredders and scrap metal processors damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnaces and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products including wheels 

  

customers 

we sell our products to wholesale customers that include collision and mechanical repair shops and new and used car dealerships as well as to retail customers we also generate a portion of our revenue from scrap sales to metal recyclers no single customer accounted for 3 or more of our revenue in 2011 

repair shops and others 

we sell the majority of our wholesale products to collision and mechanical repair shops industry reports estimate there were approximately 53000 collision repair shops including those owned by new car dealerships in the us in 2010 the same reports estimate there were approximately 76000 general including mechanical repair garages but excluding new car dealership service departments in the us in 2010 the majority of these customers tend to be individuallyowned small businesses although there has been a trend toward consolidation resulting in the formation of several national and regional repair companies we also sell our products to automobile dealerships car rental companies and fleet management groups 

insurance companies 

automobile insurance companies wield significant influence on the demand for our products while insurance companies do not pay for our products directly they ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount as a result insurance companies often influence the types of products used in a repair 

our presence in all major markets in the us and canada gives us a distinctive ability to service the major automobile insurance companies insurance companies generally operate at a national or regional level the use of our products provides a direct benefit to these companies by lowering the cost of repairs decreasing the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and providing a replacement product that is of high quality and comparable performance to the part replaced 

we assist insurance companies by providing high quality aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured products to collision repair shops especially to repair shops that are part of an insurance company’s direct repair program “drp” network a repair shop participating in a drp is referred potential work from the insurance company in exchange for providing assurances to the insurance company of quality timeliness and cost industry reports indicate approximately 44 of collision repair shops participate in drps and between 40 and 50 of a repairer’s business is generated through participation in drp networks in 2010 the average repairer participated in approximately three drps an increase from two drps per repairer in 2000 to meet the needs of the drps professional repairers have been required to become fluent in claims handling our keyless system assists these repairers by indicating the availability of alternative products as replacements for damaged oem products this data also helps insurance companies monitor the body shops’ compliance with its drp product guidelines that might for instance stipulate the use of the lowest cost products that meet quality specifications in addition in some markets insurance companies are able to dispose of low value total loss vehicles directly to us so they can save the transaction fees associated with selling these vehicles through salvage auctions 

sales and marketing 

in the case of repairs paid for as a result of insurance claims which industry publications estimate are approximately 89 of all repairs insurance companies give collision repair shops directives as to what type of replacement products are eligible for reimbursement typically insurance carriers have established a hierarchy or decision tree prioritizing the types of products to be used for repairs as an example a protocol may require recycled products if available if recycled products are not available then refurbished products and if recycled or refurbished products are not available aftermarket products if none of these alternative product types is 

  

available the shop may then use new oem replacement products as a body shop looks for products for a repair the sourcing of products typically begins with a call to one of our recycled operations or one of our competitors our recycled sales personnel are encouraged to capture the sale as a “onestop shop” and if recycled products are out of stock to fill orders from our refurbished or aftermarket product inventory to support these efforts we have provided our sales staff with access to both recycled and aftermarket sales systems and we have developed sales incentive programs that encourage cross selling throughout our wholesale operations 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 1700 fulltime sales staff in our north american wholesale operating segment the full time sales personnel are located at sales desks at our facilities or at one of the regional call centers we operate we deploy a call routing system that redirects overflow calls to alternative call centers typically located within the same region we also operate two other call centers one to support national accounts and the other to support insurance adjusters’ needs and questions our sales personnel are encouraged to initiate outbound calls in addition to the inbound calls they handle our sales staff can use customer estimates from our keyless estimating system to generate sales leads for both aftermarket and recycled products 

we are continually reviewing and revising the pricing of wholesale products our pricing specialists consider factors such as recent demand levels inventory quantity on hand and turnover rates new oem product prices and local competitive pricing with the goal of optimizing revenue we set list prices and then sell items at a discount to list with the discount typically based on each customer’s purchasing volume we may adjust prices during the year in response to material price changes of new oem replacement products 

we believe our commitment to stock inventory in local warehouses supplemented by the inventory sharing system within our regional trading zones improves our ability to meet our customers’ requirements more frequently than our competitors and gives us a competitive advantage

we have a distribution network of over 290 wholesale plants and warehouses across the us and canada of which 50 function as large hub or cross dock facilities our network of facilities allows us to develop and maintain our relationships with local repair shops while providing a level of service that is made possible by our nationwide presence our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries as required by our customers using drivers who routinely deliver to the same customers our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network 

we have developed an internal distribution network to allow our sales representatives to sell our products within regional trading zones thus improving our ability to fulfill customer requests and accelerating inventory turnover each weekday we operate over 280 transfer runs between our cross dock facilities and our plants and warehouses within our regional trading zones to redistribute our alternative products for delivery on the next day in addition we have approximately 2700 local delivery routes serving our customers each weekday 

each sale results in the generation of a work order at the location housing the specific product a dispatcher is then responsible for ensuring fulfillment accuracy printing the final invoice and including the product on the appropriate truck route for delivery to the customer in markets where we offer more than one alternative product type we have begun to integrate the delivery of multiple product types on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs and improve customer service we operate a delivery fleet of mediumsized trucks and smaller trucks and vans over time our delivery vehicles will become more consistent as we reconfigure the fleet to include vehicles that can carry all four product types 

  

competition 

we consider all suppliers of vehicle collision and mechanical products to be competitors including aftermarket suppliers recycling businesses refurbishing operations parts remanufacturers oems and internetbased suppliers we do not consider retail chains that focus on the doityourself market to be our direct competitors we believe the principal areas of differentiation in our industry include availability of inventory pricing product quality and service 

the aftermarket product distribution business is highly fragmented and our competitors other than oems are generally independently owned distributors with one to three distribution centers similarly we compete with domestic vehicle product recyclers most of which are singleunit operators in some markets smaller competitors have organized affiliations to share marketing and distribution resources including internet sites we compete with alternative parts distributors on the basis of our nationwide distribution system our product lines and inventory availability customer service our relationships with insurance companies and to a lesser extent price 

manufacturers of new original equipment products sell the majority of automobile replacement products we believe however that as the insurance and repair industries continue to recognize the advantages of aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured products the alternatives to new oem replacement products will account for a larger percentage of total vehicle replacement product sales since 2007 alternative parts usage has increased from approximately 31 to 37 of the collision replacement product market we compete with oems on the basis of price service and product quality 

wholesale auto products—europe 

our european wholesale operating segment was formed in the fourth quarter of 2011 with our acquisition of ecp the uk’s largest distributor of automotive aftermarket products we operate 90 branches supported by eight regional hubs and a national distribution center which allows us to reach most major markets within the uk with its national distribution system and it infrastructure we believe ecp will serve as a platform to expand into complementary products to increase market penetration in this region as well as to further develop a collision repair parts business similar to our north american wholesale operations 

inventory 

in 2011 we sold more than 121000 skus of aftermarket products primarily composed of mechanical aftermarket parts for the repair of vehicles five to 15 years old our top selling products include electrical products such as spark plugs and ignition coils clutches and related parts steering and suspension parts and brake pads and sensors in 2011 our top 10 suppliers represented approximately 38 of our inventory purchases with our top supplier representing approximately 8 of our purchases no suppliers outside of our top ten suppliers provided more than 3 of our annual purchases the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from vendors located primarily in the uk and other european countries in 2011 we purchased approximately 70 of our aftermarket products from manufacturers in the uk and 19 of our products from other european countries approximately 11 of our products were procured from vendors located in china 

we provide value to our customers by offering aftermarket products that in many cases are sourced from the same suppliers used by oems by working directly with the manufacturers we are able to eliminate many intermediate steps in the parts supply chain to offer the same products for a lower price compared to oems for many of our products we also offer lowercost lines for our customers that are more cost conscious 

customers 

we sell the majority of our products to over 32000 professional repairers including primarily independent mechanical repair shops and collision repair shops in addition to our sales to repair shops we also generate a 

  

portion of our revenue through sales to retail customers from our branch stores which have historically represented less than 20 of our revenue no single customer accounted for more than 2 of our revenue in 2011 

sales and marketing 

to place an order our customers will generally call a sales representative at the nearest branch or may call our central call center using an electronic automotive exchange and our integrated it platform displaying inventory availability our sales representatives can locate for our customers to the appropriate replacement part we set list prices for our products and then apply a discount off of list primarily depending on each customer’s purchasing volume customer orders are then filled from the local branch or routed to another location as necessary to fill the order 

similar to our north american wholesale operations insurance companies significantly influence the purchasing decisions for collision products in the uk we believe the historically low alternative collision parts usage percentage which is currently less than 10 provides an opportunity for us in this market particularly as insurance companies look to lower their costs as a result we have begun to develop business relationships with insurance companies and implement insurerbased marketing models to bring visibility to the cost savings that can be achieved through the use of alternative parts as we continue to grow our collision parts offerings over time in this market we believe we will be wellpositioned to serve as a lowercost alternative for insured repairs in the uk 

distribution 

we employ a central stock replenishment system supported by our integrated it platform to monitor historical demand lost sales and orders using this information we are better able to appropriately stock our branches to meet customer requests our typical branch location holds between 10 and 20 of our available skus with nightly replenishment from our national distribution center and other distribution hubs for several of our branches we can deliver an instock part within one hour in the event that a branch does not have a requested part the part is supplied by either the hubs or the national distribution center within 24 hours we deliver parts to our customers on our vans or third party motorcycles with 35000 daily deliveries or otherwise by third party carriers 

competition 

we view all suppliers of replacement repair products as our competitors including other alternative parts suppliers and oems while we compete with all alternative parts suppliers there are few with a distribution network reaching most major markets in the uk we believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other alternative parts suppliers primarily through our distribution network which allows us to deliver our products quickly as well as through our product lines and inventory availability pricing and service we compete with oems primarily on the basis of price service and availability 

self service retail products 

our self service retail operations sell parts from older cars and light trucks directly to consumers in addition to revenue from the sale of parts core and scrap we charge a small admission fee to access the property our self service facilities typically consist of a fenced or enclosed area of several acres with vehicles stored outdoors and a retail building through which customers are able to access the yard as of december 31 2011 we conducted our self service retail operations from 47 facilities in north america 

inventory 

we acquire inventory for our self service retail product operations from a variety of sources including but not limited to towing companies municipality sales auctions insurance carriers the general public and 

  

charitable organizations we typically procure salvage vehicles that are more than eight model years old for our self service retail product operations these vehicles will typically be older and of lower quality than the salvage vehicles we purchase for our wholesale recycled product operations in 2011 we purchased approximately 352000 lower cost self service and crush only vehicles 

processing and placement 

vehicles are typically delivered to our locations by the seller though in some cases we will arrange for transportation once on our property minimal labor is required to process the vehicle other than removing the fluids catalytic converters and hazardous materials vehicles are then placed in the yard for customers to remove parts the vehicle inventory is usually organized according to domestic and foreign cars further organized by make passenger vans and trucks in our self service business availability of a specific part will depend on which vehicles are currently at the site and to what extent parts may have previously been removed and sold 

part prices are listed on regularly updated price sheets and will vary by part type but not by make or model for instance four cylinder engines are priced the same amount regardless of vehicle make model age or condition we usually allow customers access to vehicles for 30 to 60 days before they are crushed and sold to scrap metal processors by maintaining a relatively short turnover period we ensure that our inventory is continually updated with different car options or removed from the yard when the saleable parts are depleted 

scrap and other materials 

our self service auto recycling operations generate scrap metal alloys and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that we no longer make available to the public and “crush only” vehicles acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site 

customers 

the customers of our self service yards are frequently doityourself mechanics small independent repair shops servicing older vehicles and auto rebuilders the scrap from the vehicle hulks is sold to recyclers with whom we may also compete when procuring salvage vehicles for our operations 

competition 

there are competitors operating self service businesses in all of the markets in which we operate in some markets there are numerous competitors often operating in close proximity to our operations we try to differentiate our business by the quality of the inventory and the size and cleanliness of the property 

heavyduty truck products 

lkq started its heavyduty recycled truck product operations in 2008 with the purchase of a recycler based in houston texas as of december 31 2011 we had a total of 18 facilities in the us and canada we began our recycled truck operations with a belief that development of a network would offer similar opportunities to those we have experienced with our wholesale recycled product operations the development of our network is ongoing but we have made progress toward integrating the operations and achieving synergies 

inventory 

our inventory is comprised of used heavy and mediumduty trucks usually five years or older which are purchased at salvage and truck auctions or directly from insurance companies or large fleet operators during 2011 we purchased approximately 6000 vehicles depending on the condition of the vehicles they may be dismantled for parts or resold as running vehicles if certain mechanical parts are damaged such as transmissions we may remanufacture them and offer them to our customers the vehicles that are acquired for resale are typically special purpose or vocational use trucks such as those used for garbage pickup or cement 

  

delivery if requested by the sellers of the vehicles we provide an assurance that the vehicles will be sold to foreign buyers and exported to countries for use outside of the us or to domestic buyers after the vehicles have been reconditioned and modified for use other than their original purpose 

by utilizing a yard management system that we implemented in 2010 we are able to provide our yards visibility to available inventory across the network we believe this system provides an advantage over our competitors who do not typically leverage a broad network to fulfill customer demand for products 

customers 

customers for recycled heavyduty truck products are often owneroperators local cartage companies operating fleets or foreign buyers or exporters seeking low cost parts most commonly engines and transmissions 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 17900 employees we are a party to a collective bargaining agreement with a union that represents 49 employees at our totowa new jersey facility approximately 415 of our employees at our bumper refurbishing plant in mexico and approximately 215 of our employees at our recycled parts facility in quebec city canada are also represented by unions other than these locations none of our employees is a member of a union or participates in other collective bargaining arrangements we consider our employee relations to be good 

facilities 

in 2011 we moved our corporate headquarters to 500 west madison street chicago illinois 60661 from our previous address at 120 north lasalle street chicago illinois 60602 in addition to our corporate headquarters we have a field support center in nashville tennessee that performs certain corporate functions including accounting procurement and information systems support many of these functions were transferred to the field support center in 2011 from regional offices where they were previously performed our european operations maintain procurement accounting and finance functions as well as a central call center in wembley outside of london england in addition to these corporate offices we have numerous operating facilities that handle wholesale self service retail and heavyduty truck products we operate out of more than 440 locations in total a majority of which are leased many of our locations stock multiple product types or serve more than one function 

included in our total locations are 90 facilities in the uk including the 500000 square foot national distribution center in tamworth that houses inventory to supply the hubs and branches of our uk operations and 30 facilities in canada five facilities in central america and two facilities in mexico 

information technology 

in 2010 we completed the installation of a proprietary facility management system called lkq x at our domestic locations that we developed for our wholesale recycled product operations to replace a third party system the new system improves the integration of inventory with the aftermarket system and provides improved control selling and data analysis features we believe that a single system that presents a combined view of aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured products helps facilitate the sales process allows for continued implementation of standard operating procedures and yields improved training efficiency employee transferability access to our national inventory database management reporting and data storage it also eliminates the need to create multiple versions of proprietary applications and systems support processes the system also supports an electronic exchange process for identifying and locating parts at other select recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock 

our north american aftermarket operations use a third party facility management system additional third party software packages have been implemented to leverage the centralized data and information that a single 

  

system provides such as a data warehouse to conduct enhanced analytics and reporting an integrated budgeting system an electronic data interchange tool and ecommerce tools to enhance our online businesstobusiness initiatives—orderkeystonecom and keyless similarly our aftermarket operations in the uk use a single integrated it platform for our purchasing branch stock and finance activities which are further supported by a distribution center system to manage inventory movement 

all of our refurbishing operations use a single facility management system our remanufacturing operations which we acquired at the end of 2010 and further expanded through additional acquisitions in 2011 currently operate on three separate it systems we expect to integrate all of our remanufacturing operations onto one it platform in the next couple of years 

in 2011 we completed the installation of a standardized point of sale system in our self service retail operations which allows enhanced management reporting as well as improved system reliability in 2010 we implemented a single enterprise system for all of our heavyduty truck operations that supports interregion sales to reduce the potential for lost sales due to outofstock parts 

the hardware that supports the systems used in our operations is located in offsite data centers the centers are in secure environments with aroundtheclock monitoring redundant power backup and multiple diverse data and telecommunication routing 

we use separate third party provided software for our financial systems such as financial and budget reporting general ledger accounting accounts payable payroll and fixed assets we currently protect our local customer inventory and corporate consolidated data such as financial information email files and other user files with daily backups these backups are stored off site with a third party data protection vendor 

we continually evaluate our systems with the goal of ensuring that all critical systems remain scalable and operational as our business grows 

regulation 

environmental compliance 

our operations and properties including the maintenance of our delivery vehicles are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations these environmental laws govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials 

we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters we have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements we cannot assure you however that we will at all times be in complete compliance with such requirements 

although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot assure you that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

contamination resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release storage transportation or disposal of gasoline motor oil antifreeze transmission fluid chlorofluorocarbons “cfcs” from air conditioners other hazardous materials or metals such as aluminum 

  

cadmium chromium lead and mercury contamination from the refurbishment of chrome plated bumpers can occur from the release of the plating material contamination can migrate onsite or offsite which can increase the risk and the amount of any potential liability 

in addition many of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use that may have involved hazardous materials as a result some of our properties may be contaminated some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination even if these owners or operators did not know of and were not responsible for such contamination these environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of treats or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties or successors to such owners or operators for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 

when we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process we analyze the risks and when appropriate perform further environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination furthermore where appropriate we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters in addition at times we or sellers from whom we purchased a business have undertaken remediation projects we do not anticipate based on currently available information and current laws that we will incur liabilities in excess of reserves to address environmental matters however in the event we discover new information or if laws change we may incur significant liabilities which may exceed our reserves 

title laws 

in some states when a vehicle is deemed a total loss a salvage title is issued whether states issue salvage titles is important to the supply of inventory for the vehicle recycling industry because an increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles currently these titling issues are a matter of state law in 1992 the us congress commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle titling registration and salvage since then legislation has been introduced seeking to establish national uniform requirements in this area including a uniform definition of a salvage vehicle the vehicle recycling industry will generally favor a uniform definition since it will avoid inconsistencies across state lines and will generally favor a definition that expands the number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage however certain interest groups including repair shops and some insurance associations may oppose this type of legislation national legislation has not yet been enacted in this area and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in the future 

anticar theft act 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any “covered major part” the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on vehicle recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may further discourage the use by such shops of recycled products there is no pending initiative to implement the parts registration from a law enforcement point of view however there is a risk that a heightened legislative concern over safety of parts might precipitate an effort to push for the implementation of such rules 

  

legislation affecting automotive repair parts 

most states have laws relating to the use of aftermarket products in motor vehicle collision repair work the provisions of these laws include consumer disclosure vehicle owner’s consent regarding the use of aftermarket products in the repair process and the requirement to have aftermarket products certified by an independent testing organization some jurisdictions have laws that regulate the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags additional laws of this kind may be enacted in the future an increase in the number of states passing such legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on our business additionally congress could enact federal legislation restricting the use of aftermarket and recycled automotive products used in the course of collision repair 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather related accidents in addition the cost of salvage vehicles may be lower as weather related accidents generate a larger supply of total loss vehicles 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend risks relating to our business 

our operating results and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the economic conditions in the us and elsewhere 

the decline in economic conditions in the us adversely impacted our business such conditions have resulted in fewer miles driven fewer accident claims and a reduction of vehicle repairs in the event that the us economic conditions decline further or do not improve we expect that our business will continue to be negatively affected we recently expanded our operations to include the united kingdom to the extent that the economic conditions in the uk deteriorate our new business could be negatively affected 

we face intense competition from local national international and internetbased vehicle products providers and this competition could negatively affect our business 

the vehicle replacement products industry is highly competitive and is served by numerous suppliers of oem recycled aftermarket refurbished and remanufactured products within each of these categories of suppliers there are local owneroperated companies larger regional suppliers national and international providers and internetbased suppliers providers of vehicle replacement products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of vehicle replacement products which may further increase competition some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise greater financial technical manufacturing distribution and other resources longer operating histories lower cost structures and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries than we do in certain regions of the us local vehicle recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in the wholesale recycled products industry as a result of these factors our competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply provide their products at lower costs or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve 

we believe that substantially in excess of 50 of collision parts by dollar amount are supplied by oems with the balance being supplied by distributors like us the oems are therefore in a position to exert pricing pressure in the marketplace we compete with the oems primarily on price and to a lesser extent on service and quality from time to time oems have experimented with reducing prices on specific products to match the lower prices of alternative products if such price reductions were to become widespread it could have a material adverse impact on our business 

  

claims by oems relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business 

oems have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims the oems have brought such claims in federal court and with the us international trade commission 

in december 2005 and may 2008 ford global technologies llc filed complaints with the international trade commission against us and others alleging that certain aftermarket products imported into the us infringed on ford design patents the parties settled these matters in april 2009 pursuant to a settlement arrangement that expires in march 2015 

us patent and trademark office records indicate that oems are seeking and obtaining more design patents then they have in the past to the extent that the oems are successful with intellectual property infringement claims we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business we will likely incur significant expenses investigating and defending intellectual property infringement claims in addition aftermarket products certifying organizations may revoke the certification of parts that are the subject of the claims lack of certification may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of aftermarket products only if they have been certified by an independent certifying organization 

an adverse change in our relationships with our suppliers or auction companies could increase our expenses and hurt our ability to serve our customers 

we are dependent on a relatively small number of suppliers of aftermarket products most of which are located in taiwan although alternative suppliers exist for substantially all aftermarket products distributed by us the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on us until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced providing products moreover our operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad including among other things transportation costs and delays political instability currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs import and export controls and other nontariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas as well as the uncertainty regarding future relations between china and taiwan because a substantial volume of our sales involves products manufactured from sheet metal we can be adversely impacted if sheet metal becomes unavailable or is only available at higher prices which we may not be able to pass on to our customers 

most of our salvage inventory is obtained from vehicles offered at salvage auctions operated by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the us we do not typically have contracts with any auction company according to industry analysts a small number of companies control a large percentage of the salvage auction market in the us if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions began competing with us or significantly raised its fees our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers moreover we are facing increased competition in the purchase of salvage vehicles from direct competitors rebuilders exporters and others this larger number of bidders has caused and may continue to cause our cost of goods sold for wholesale recycled products to increase some states regulate bidders to help ensure that salvage vehicles are purchased for legal purposes by qualified buyers auction companies have been actively seeking to reduce circumvent or eliminate these regulations which would further increase the number of bidders 

we also acquire inventory directly from insurance companies oems and others to the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue these arrangements our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers 

  

if our business relationships with insurance companies end we may lose important sales opportunities 

our success depends in part on the acceptance and promotion of alternative parts usage by automotive insurance companies in some places that we operate alternative parts usage is low and there can be no assurance that such usage will increase we also rely on business relationships with several insurance companies these insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide the business relationships include in some cases participation in aftermarket quality and service assurance programs that may result in a higher usage of our aftermarket products than would be the case without the programs our arrangements with these companies may be terminated by them at any time including in connection with their own business concerns relating to the offering availability standards or operations of the aftermarket quality and service assurance programs we rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in an illinois lawsuit involving state farm mutual automobile insurance company  “avery v state farm”  a jury decided in october 1999 that state farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using nonoem replacement products to repair damaged vehicles when use of such products did not restore the vehicle to its “preloss condition” the jury found that state farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of nonoem replacement products and the alleged inferiority of those products the jury assessed damages against state farm of 456 million and the judge assessed an additional 730 million of disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the illinois consumer fraud act in april 2001 the illinois appellate court upheld the verdict but reduced the damage award by 130 million because of duplicative damage awards on august 18 2005 the illinois supreme court reversed the awards made by the circuit court and found among other things that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any breach of contract by state farm the us supreme court declined to hear an appeal of this case as a result of this case some insurance companies reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket products our financial results could be adversely affected if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled products from us due to a fear of similar claims 

we may not be able to sell our products due to existing or new laws and regulations prohibiting or restricting the sale of wholesale aftermarket recycled refurbished or remanufactured products 

some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled products restrictions on the products we are able to sell could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

most states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair work andor require enhanced disclosure or vehicle owner consent before using aftermarket products in such repair work additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future if additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business 

certain organizations test the quality and safety of vehicle replacement products if these organizations decide not to test a particular vehicle product or in the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product such events could adversely affect our business 

  

we may not be able to successfully acquire new businesses or integrate acquisitions which could cause our business to suffer 

we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms or for other reasons if we buy a company or a division of a company we may experience difficulty integrating that company’s or division’s personnel and operations which could negatively affect our operating results in addition 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our credit agreement places restrictions on our business 

we have a senior secured debt financing facility with a group of lenders our total outstanding indebtedness including bank financing letters of credit and notes payable in connection with acquisitions as of december 31 2011 was 9914 million the credit agreement contains operating and financial restrictions and requires that we satisfy certain financial and other covenants the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit agreement a default if not waived could result in acceleration of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing credit facility or it may be on terms that are not acceptable to us 

our future capital needs may require that we seek debt financing or additional equity funding that if not available could cause our business to suffer 

we may need to raise additional funds in the future to among other things refinance existing debt fund our existing operations improve or expand our operations respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions from time to time we may raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic alliances or other arrangements however the recent turmoil in the credit markets has resulted in tighter credit conditions which could affect our ability to raise additional funds if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and further limitations on our operations if we fail to raise capital when needed our business may be negatively affected 

  

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control future factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to those listed in the special note on forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k accordingly our results of operations may not be indicative of future performance these fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which could cause our stock price or the value of our debt instruments to decline 

fluctuations in the prices of metals or shipping costs could adversely affect our financial results 

all of our recycling operations generate scrap metal and other metals that we sell after we dismantle a salvage vehicle for wholesale parts and after vehicles have been used in our self service retail business the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors and other remaining metals are sold to processors and brokers of metals in addition we receive “crush only” vehicles from other companies including oems which we dismantle and which generate scrap metal and other metals the prices of scrap and other metals have historically fluctuated sometimes significantly due to market factors in addition buyers may stop purchasing metals entirely due to excess supply to the extent that the prices of metals decrease materially or buyers stop purchasing metals our revenue from such sales will suffer and a writedown of our inventory value could be required the cost of our wholesale recycled and our self service retail inventory purchases may also decrease as a result of falling scrap metal and other metals prices however there can be no assurance that our inventory purchasing cost will decrease the same amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal and other metals prices decline and there may be a delay between the scrap metal and other metals price reductions and any inventory cost reductions the price of steel is a component of the cost to manufacture products for our aftermarket business we incur substantial freight costs to import parts from our suppliers many of whom are located in asia if the cost of steel or freight rose we might not be able to pass the cost increases on to our customers 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur significant charges to our pretax income 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations in the future goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of acquisitions goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses increases in our cost of capital adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including modifications that restrict the activities of the acquired business as of december 31 2011 our total goodwill subject to future impairment testing was 15 billion for further discussion of our annual impairment test see “goodwill impairment” in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of item 7 in this annual report on form 10k 

if the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines or the number of cars being repaired declines our business could suffer 

because our business depends on vehicle accidents for both the demand for repairs using our products and the supply of wholesale recycled products factors which influence the number andor severity of accidents including but not limited to the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven the ages of drivers the use of cellular telephones and other electronic equipment by drivers the congestion of traffic the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers the effectiveness of accident avoidance systems in new vehicles and the condition of roadways impact our business in this regard a number of states and municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones while driving and such restrictions could lead to a decline in accidents to the extent oems develop or are mandated by law to install new accident avoidance systems the number and severity of accidents 

  

could decrease moreover an increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road to decline and the number of miles driven to decline as motorists seek alternative transportation options and this also could lead to a decline in accidents in addition the number of new automobiles sold annually in the us has dropped since 2007 compared to the average number of new vehicles sold annually from 1999 through 2006 this could result in a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road and consequently fewer vehicles involved in accidents in addition the average age of vehicles has been increasing and insurance companies may find it uneconomical to repair older vehicles 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits 

our operating subsidiaries must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations when we develop or acquire a new facility we must seek the approval of state and local units of government governmental agencies may resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling or refurbishing facility in their communities there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold 

if we lose our key management personnel we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives if we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel which could harm our business 

we rely on information technology and communication systems in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business 

some of the information technology systems and communication systems we use for management of our facilities and our financial functions are leased from or operated by other companies while others are owned by us in the event that the providers of these systems terminate their relationships with us or if we suffer prolonged outages of these or our own systems for whatever reason we could suffer disruptions to our operations 

in addition we continually monitor these systems to find areas for improvement in the event that we decided to switch providers or to implement our own systems we may also suffer disruptions to our business we may be unsuccessful in the development of our own systems and we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing our own systems also our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system which period could extend longer than we anticipated 

if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks our business could be harmed 

we use a fleet of trucks to deliver the majority of the products we sell we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in the transportation infrastructure governmental regulation availability and price of fuel liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance and insurance premium increases in addition our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground 

  

air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials 

we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials 

under certain environmental laws we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at or migration to or from our or our predecessors’ past or present facilities and at independent waste disposal sites these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or was not responsible for the release of such hazardous substances 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we could be subject to product liability claims 

if customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage we could be subject to product liability claims by such customers the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we have agreed to defend and indemnify in certain circumstances insurance companies that could be named as defendants in such lawsuits the existence of claims for which we must defend and indemnify insurance companies could negatively impact our business results of operations or financial condition 

regulations that may be issued under the anticar theft act could harm our business 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any “covered major part” the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on automotive parts recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may further discourage the use of recycled products by such shops 

future adjustments to contingent purchase price related to acquisitions could materially affect our results 

from time to time we acquire companies with a component of the purchase consideration being delayed and the payment thereof contingent on certain performance or other factors the “contingent purchase price” the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that we estimate the amount of the contingent purchase price at the time we complete the acquisition each subsequent reporting period until the contingent purchase price is either paid or no longer potentially payable we are required to reevaluate the estimated amount of remaining contingent purchase price that is likely to be paid if the revised estimate of the future contingent purchase price is higher than the amount accrued then the difference must be recorded and charged to the income statement in that period if the revised estimate of the future contingent purchase price is lower than the amount accrued then the accrual is reduced and the difference is credited to income for the 

  

period because some of these payments would not be deductible for tax purposes it is possible that the expense or income would not be taxeffected on our income statements these adjustments if required could be material to our future results of operations 

we operate in foreign jurisdictions which exposes us to foreign exchange and other risks 

we have operations in the uk canada and mexico we are thus subject to foreign exchange exposure to the extent that we purchase inventory in different currencies than we denominate our sales as well as exposure to foreign tax and other foreign and domestic laws in addition mexico is currently experiencing a heightened level of criminal activity that could affect our ability to maintain our supply of certain aftermarket products 

risks relating to our common stock and financial structure 

future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 

we and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock or other equity debt or instruments which constitute an element of our debt and equity collectively “securities” in the future we may also issue shares of common stock under our equity incentive plan or in connection with future acquisitions we cannot predict the size of future issuances of securities or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock or other securities will have on the price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued in connection with an acquisition or the perception that such sales could occur may cause the price of our common stock to fall 

delaware law our charter documents and our loan documents may impede or discourage a takeover which could affect the price of our stock 

the antitakeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws our loan documents and delaware law could together or separately impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult our credit agreement provides that a change of control is an event of default our incorporation under delaware law and these provisions could also impede an acquisition takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we provide replacement parts components and systems needed to repair vehicles cars and trucks buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers “oems” which are commonly known as oem products new products produced by companies other than the oems which are sometimes referred to as “aftermarket” products recycled products originally produced by oems which we refer to as recycled products used products that have been refurbished and used products that have been remanufactured 

we distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops including aftermarket collision and mechanical products recycled collision and mechanical products refurbished collision replacement products such as wheels bumper covers and lights and remanufactured engines collectively we refer to our products as alternative parts we are the nation’s largest provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and a leading provider of alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products our sales processing and distribution facilities reach most major markets in the us and canada we expanded our wholesale operations effective october 1 2011 with our acquisition of euro car parts holdings limited “ecp” the largest distributor of automotive aftermarket products in the united kingdom in addition to our wholesale operations we operate self service retail facilities that sell recycled automotive products we also sell recycled heavyduty truck products and used heavyduty trucks we have organized our businesses into four operating segments wholesale—north america wholesale—europe self service and heavyduty truck we aggregate our north american operating segments wholesale—north america self service and heavyduty truck into one reportable segment resulting in two reportable segments north america and europe 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to those listed in the special note on forwardlooking statements in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k due to these factors our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate accordingly our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance 

acquisitions 

since our inception in 1998 we have pursued a growth strategy of both organic growth and acquisitions we have pursued acquisitions that we believe will help drive profitability cash flow and stockholder value our principal focus for acquisitions is companies that will expand our geographic presence and our ability to provide a wider choice of alternative vehicle replacement products to our customers 

effective october 1 2011 we acquired ecp which marks our entry into the european automotive aftermarket business ecp operates out of 90 branches supported by eight regional hubs and a national distribution center from which multiple deliveries are made each day ecp’s product offerings are primarily focused on automotive aftermarket mechanical products many of which are sourced from the same suppliers that provide products to the oems the expansion of our geographic presence beyond north america into the european market offers an opportunity to us as that market has historically had a low penetration of alternative collision parts 

in addition to our acquisition of ecp we made 20 acquisitions in north america in 2011 12 wholesale businesses five recycled heavyduty truck products businesses and three self service retail operations our acquisitions included the purchase of two engine remanufacturers which expanded our presence in the remanufacturing industry that we entered in 2010 additionally our acquisition of an automotive heating and cooling component distributor supplements our expansion into the automotive heating and cooling aftermarket 

  

products market our north american wholesale business acquisitions also included the purchase of the us vehicle refinish paint distribution business of akzo nobel automotive and aerospace coatings the “akzo nobel paint business” which allowed us to increase our paint and related product offerings and expand our geographic presence in the automotive paint market our other 2011 acquisitions enabled us to expand our geographic presence and enter new markets 

in 2010 we made 20 acquisitions in north america 16 wholesale businesses one recycled heavyduty truck products business two self service retail operations and one tire recycling business our acquisitions included the purchase of an engine remanufacturer which allowed us to further vertically integrate our supply chain we expanded our product offerings through the acquisition of an automotive heating and cooling component business as well as a tire recycling business our 2010 acquisitions have also enabled us to expand our geographic presence most notably in canada through our purchase of cross canada an aftermarket product supplier 

in 2009 we acquired eight businesses in north america five wholesale businesses and three recycled heavyduty truck products businesses the acquisitions enabled us to increase our geographic presence in the wholesale products business and expand our network of recycled heavyduty truck products facilities our 2009 acquisitions included greenleaf auto recyclers llc “greenleaf” which we purchased from schnitzer steel industries inc “ssi” in october this acquisition enabled us to increase our geographic presence and increase our capacity in numerous markets 

divestitures 

in october 2009 we sold to ssi four retail oriented self service facilities in oregon and washington we also sold certain business assets to ssi related to two self service retail facilities in northern california and a self service retail facility in portland oregon we have closed the two self service retail facilities in northern california and converted the self service operation in portland to a wholesale recycling business we also agreed to sell to ssi two self service retail facilities in dallas texas and closed this portion of the transaction on january 15 2010 certain of these facilities qualified for treatment as discontinued operations the financial results and assets and liabilities of these facilities are segregated from our continuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income for all periods presented unless otherwise noted this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates only to financial results from continuing operations 

sources of revenue 

we report our revenue in three categories i aftermarket other new and refurbished products ii recycled remanufactured and related products and services and iii other 

our revenue from the sale of vehicle replacement products and related services includes sales of i aftermarket other new and refurbished products and ii recycled remanufactured and related products and services during 2011 sales of vehicle replacement products and services represented approximately 84 of our consolidated sales of these sales approximately 59 were derived from the sales of aftermarket other new and refurbished products while 41 were composed of recycled and remanufactured products and services sales our aftermarket other new and refurbished products revenue includes revenue generated by ecp an automotive aftermarket products distributor between the acquisition date and yearend with our acquisitions of engine remanufacturers in 2010 and 2011 we have begun to vertically integrate our recycled and remanufactured products supply chain by bringing the engine remanufacturing process in house 

we sell the majority of our vehicle replacement products to collision and mechanical repair shops our vehicle replacement products include engines transmissions frontends doors trunk lids bumper covers hoods fenders grilles valances wheels head lamps and tail lamps for an additional fee we sell extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products these contracts cover the cost of parts and labor and are sold for 

  

periods of six months one year two years or a nontransferable lifetime warranty we defer the revenue from such contracts and recognize it ratably over the term of the contracts or three years in the case of lifetime warranties the demand for our products and services is influenced by several factors including the number of vehicles in operation the number of miles being driven the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents availability and pricing of new parts seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions additionally automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process accordingly we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our products while they are not our direct customers we do provide insurance carriers services in an effort to promote the increased usage of alternative replacement products in the repair process such services include the review of vehicle repair order estimates direct quotation services to insurance company adjusters and an aftermarket parts quality and service assurance program we neither charge a fee to the insurance carriers for these services nor adjust our pricing of products for our customers when we perform these services for insurance carriers 

there is no standard price for many of our products but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as product availability quality demand new oem replacement product prices the age of the vehicle from which the part was obtained and competitor pricing 

in 2011 revenue from other sources represented approximately 16 of our consolidated sales these other sources include scrap sales and sales of aluminum ingots and sows we derive scrap metal from several sources including vehicles that have been used in both our wholesale and self service recycling operations and from oems and other entities that contract with us to dismantle and scrap certain vehicles which we refer to as “crush only” vehicles revenue from scrap sales will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices the speed with which they fluctuate and the volume of vehicles we sell for scrap 

cost of goods sold 

our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts freight and overhead costs including labor fuel expense and facility and machinery costs related to the purchasing warehousing and distribution of our inventory our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors our cost of goods sold for refurbished products includes the price we pay for inventory freight and costs to refurbish the parts including direct and indirect labor facility costs including rent and utilities machinery and equipment costs including equipment rental repairs and maintenance depreciation and other overhead related to refurbishing operations 

our cost of goods sold for recycled products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and where applicable auction storage and towing fees our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles since 2009 our labor and laborrelated costs related to acquisition and dismantling have accounted for approximately 8 of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle we are facing increasing competition in the purchase of salvage vehicles from shredders and scrap recyclers internetbased buyers and others combined with overall higher demand for used vehicles resulting from the economic decline beginning in late 2008 we have been paying and may continue to pay higher prices for salvage vehicles the acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and as a result energy costs are not material our cost of goods sold for remanufactured products includes the price we pay for cores freight costs to remanufacture the products including direct and indirect labor rent depreciation and other overhead related to remanufacturing operations 

some of our salvage mechanical products are sold with a standard sixmonth warranty against defects additionally some of our remanufactured engines are sold with a standard threeyear warranty against defects we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claims information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses we also sell separately priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products the expense related to extended warranty claims is recognized when the claim is made 

  

expenses 

our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our aftermarket warehouses wholesale and heavyduty truck salvage yards and self service retail facilities these costs include labor for plant management and facility and warehouse personnel and related incentive compensation and employee benefits rent other facility expenses such as utilities property insurance and taxes and repairs and maintenance costs related to our facilities and equipment the costs included in facility and warehouse expenses do not relate to inventory processing or conversion activities and as such are classified below the gross margin line on our consolidated statements of income 

our distribution expenses primarily include our costs to prepare and deliver our products to our customers included in our distribution expense category are labor costs for drivers fuel third party freight costs local delivery and transfer truck leases or rentals vehicle repairs and maintenance supplies and insurance 

our selling and marketing expenses primarily include salary commission and other incentive compensation expenses for sales personnel advertising promotion and marketing costs telephone and other communication expenses credit card fees and bad debt expense since 2009 personnel costs have accounted for approximately 80 of our selling and marketing expenses most of our product sales personnel are paid on a commission basis the number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our customers’ needs and increase our sales volume our objective is to continually evaluate our sales force develop and implement training programs and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness 

our general and administrative expenses primarily include the costs of our corporate offices and financial services center that provide corporate and field management treasury accounting legal payroll business development human resources and information systems functions these costs include wages and benefits for corporate regional and administrative personnel stockbased compensation and other incentive compensation accounting legal and other professional fees it system support and maintenance expenses and telephone and other communication costs 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather related accidents in addition the cost of salvage vehicles tends to be lower as more weather related accidents occur generating a larger supply of total loss vehicles 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition inventory valuation business combinations goodwill impairment selfinsurance programs contingencies accounting for income taxes and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

revenue recognition 

we recognize and report revenue from the sale of vehicle replacement products when they are shipped or picked up and title has transferred subject to a reserve for returns discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information a product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment our customers may earn discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment we analyze historical returns and allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates we use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold if actual returns and allowances are higher than our historical experience there would be an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence 

for an additional fee we also sell extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products revenue from these contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the contracts or three years in the case of lifetime warranties 

inventory accounting 

aftermarket and refurbished product inventory aftermarket and refurbished product inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market our aftermarket inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for parts and includes expenses incurred for freight and overhead costs for items purchased from foreign sources import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included our refurbished product inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for cores and includes expenses incurred for freight refurbishing costs and overhead 

salvage and remanufactured inventory salvage inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle including auction storage and towing fees as well as expenditures for buying and dismantling inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facility’s inventory at expected selling prices the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility’s historical vehicle profitability for salvage vehicles purchased at auction or from contracted rates for salvage vehicles acquired under direct procurement arrangements remanufactured inventory cost is based upon the price paid for cores and also includes expenses incurred for freight direct manufacturing costs and overhead 

for all inventory our carrying value is reduced regularly to reflect the age and current anticipated demand for our products if actual demand differs from our estimates additional reductions to our inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made 

business combinations 

we record our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values we utilize management estimates and in some instances independent thirdparty valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and contingent consideration granted such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions including projections of future events and operating performance the purchase price allocation is subject to change during the measurement period which is limited to one year subsequent to the acquisition date 

for certain acquisitions we may issue contingent consideration under which additional payments will be made to the former owners if specified future events occur or conditions are met such as meeting profitability or earnings targets each contingent consideration obligation is measured at the acquisition date fair value of the consideration which is determined using the discounted probabilityweighted expected cash flows at each subsequent reporting period we remeasure the liability at fair value and record any changes to the fair value 

  

through change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities within other expense income on our consolidated statements of income increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates variances between actual results achieved and projected results changes in the projected results of the acquired business or changes in our assessment of the probabilities surrounding the achievement of targets detailed in the respective agreements as of december 31 2011 we recorded 824 million of contingent consideration liabilities actual payouts under these contingent consideration arrangements will be determined at the end of the performance periods and if the maximum payments were earned the total payout would be approximately 110 million 

goodwill impairment 

we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually in september 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201108 “testing goodwill for impairment” which grants entities the option to first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value under this asu if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value the entity is required to perform the twostep impairment test for the reporting unit the revised guidance also allows an entity to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to step one of the twostep impairment analysis where a fair value calculation is performed this guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 early adoption is also permitted and we elected to adopt this guidance for our goodwill impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2011 

under both the qualitative assessment and the twostep quantitative impairment test we are required to evaluate events and circumstances that may affect the performance of the reporting unit and the extent to which the events and circumstances may impact the future cash flows of the reporting unit to determine whether the fair value of the assets exceed the carrying value if these assumptions or estimates change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill 

we are organized into four operating segments wholesale—north america wholesale—europe self service and heavyduty truck we have also concluded that these four operating segments are reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing in 2011 we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist during 2011 we did not identify any events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts therefore we did not perform any impairment tests other than our annual test in the fourth quarter of 2011 

in 2011 we performed a qualitative assessment under the guidance of asu 201108 for our wholesale—north america and self service reporting units based on our analyses we determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded the respective carrying value and no adjustments to goodwill were required after considering the results of the heavyduty truck 2010 impairment test and the growth in the reporting unit in 2011 we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit in our step one calculation we established the fair value of the reporting unit using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach we believe that using two methods to determine fair value limits the chances of an unrepresentative valuation the results of this test indicated that the goodwill was not impaired a 10 decrease in the fair value estimate of the heavyduty truck reporting unit would not have changed this determination given the limited period of time between the acquisition date of ecp and the date of our impairment test we updated our quantitative assessment of the reporting unit’s fair value from the acquisition date to the date of our annual goodwill impairment test based on the results of this analysis we concluded that the fair value of the wholesale—europe exceeded the carrying value and no adjustments to goodwill were required 

  

as of december 31 2011 we had a total of 15 billion in goodwill subject to future impairment tests if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results 

selfinsurance programs 

we selfinsure a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program we also selfinsure a portion of our property and casualty risk which includes automobile liability general liability directors and officers liability workers’ compensation and property under deductible insurance programs we purchase certain stoploss insurance to limit our liability exposure the insurance premium costs are expensed over the contract periods 

we record an accrual for the claims expense related to our employee medical benefits automobile liability general liability directors and officers liability workers’ compensation and property claims based upon the expected amount of all such claims if actual claims are higher than what we anticipated our accrual might be insufficient to cover our claims costs and we would increase our claims expense in that period to cover the shortfall 

contingencies 

we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business resulting from litigation claims and other commitments and from a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies we accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we determine the amount of reserves if any with the assistance of outside legal counsel we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether the accruals should be adjusted if the amount of an actual loss were greater than the amount we have accrued the excess loss would have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period that the loss occurred if the loss contingency is subsequently determined to no longer be probable the amount of loss contingency previously accrued would be included in our operating results in the period such determination was made we do not expect the resolution of loss contingencies to have a material effect on our financial statements 

accounting for income taxes 

all income tax amounts reflect the use of the liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions with different tax rates and we determine the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based upon various estimates and assumptions 

we record a provision for taxes based upon our effective income tax rate we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we expect is more likely than not to be realized we consider historical taxable income expectations and risks associated with our estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we had a valuation allowance of 19 million and 26 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively against our deferred tax assets should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment of 19 million to the net deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made conversely should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made 

  

we recognize the benefits of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns in the provision for income taxes only for those positions that are more likely than not to be realized we recognize interest and penalties accrued relating to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax expense in the normal course of business we will undergo tax audits by various tax jurisdictions such audits often require an extended period of time to complete and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits changes in accruals for uncertainties arising from the resolution of preacquisition contingencies and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances of acquired businesses after the measurement period will be recorded in earnings in the period the changes are determined adjustments to other tax accruals are generally recognized in the period they are determined 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for all stockbased payments including employee stock options at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all awards on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award 

our last option grant was in 2010 for valuing our option grants we utilized several key factors and assumptions within our valuation model we have been in existence since february 1998 and have been a public company since october 2003 we elected to use the blackscholes valuation model at the last grant date we used the simplified method in developing an estimate of expected life of stock options because we lacked sufficient data to calculate an expected life based on historical experience our first annual option grant with a full five year vesting period since we became a public company was on january 13 2006 and these awards became fully vested in january 2011 additionally our options have a ten year life while our existence as a public company had been just over six years when the 2010 grant was made in the event that we issue more options in the future we will reassess the use of the simplified method based on the additional historical information available we estimated volatility which is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of the option based on the historical volatility of our stock our forfeiture assumptions were based on voluntary and involuntary termination behavior as well as historical forfeiture rates we estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimates if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the dividend yield represents the dividend rate expected to be paid over the option’s expected term and we currently have no plans to pay dividends the riskfree interest rate was based on us treasury zerocoupon issues available at the time each option is granted that have a remaining life approximately equal to the option’s expected life

results of operations—consolidated 

the following table sets forth statements of income data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated 

 

 year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

revenue our revenue increased 324 to 33 billion in 2011 compared to 25 billion in 2010 the increase in revenue was primarily due to business acquisitions the higher volume of products we sold and higher revenue from scrap metal and other metals sales our acquisition related revenue growth of 215 includes 138 million of incremental revenue generated by ecp since its acquisition effective october 1 2011 our total organic revenue growth rate was 107 composed of 79 and 280 organic growth in parts and services revenue and other revenue respectively organic growth in parts and services revenue reflects the increase in salvage revenue over relatively lower levels during the prior year due primarily to volume increases the prior year period was impacted by the cash for clunkers program under which we purchased lower cost older vehicles that did not have the same parts revenue potential as our more recent inventory purchases additionally during the first quarter of 2010 we reduced purchases of salvage vehicles due to higher acquisition prices at the salvage auctions resulting in lower volume of salvage parts available for sale during the first two quarters of 2010 during the second half of 2011 our organic revenue growth rate in parts and services revenue of 65 reflected the lessening impact of the cash for clunkers program and lower buying levels on the prior year results our aftermarket revenue increased primarily due to growth in sales volumes which resulted from higher inventory purchases that contributed to a greater volume of parts available for sale the growth in other revenue which includes sales of scrap metal and other metals was primarily due to higher metals prices combined with higher volume of scrap sold we also had a 01 favorable impact on revenue derived from foreign exchange on our canadian operations 

cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased to 574 of revenue in 2011 from 557 of revenue in 2010 of the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue 08 was due to higher input costs combined with competitive sales pricing pressure in our aftermarket products cost of goods sold in 2011 was also impacted by a shift in product mix which increased cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue by 06 certain of our acquisitions toward the end of 2010 and during 2011 increased our revenue in product lines that are complementary to our existing vehicle replacement parts offerings but have lower gross margins such as remanufactured engines the product mix effect was also partially generated by sales of scrap aluminum as we 

  

expanded our furnace capacity through an acquisition in august 2010 our sales of scrap aluminum which is a byproduct of our wheel refinishing operations generate lower margins than our sales of vehicle products our acquisition of ecp which generates lower gross margins than our north american business because of a greater weighting on lower margin mechanical products increased our cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue by 02 vehicle acquisition costs in our self service business grew at a greater rate than revenue as purchase costs were driven higher by increased demand for used cars and higher scrap prices while scrap metal prices declined late in 2011 average vehicle acquisition costs did not fall as suppliers continued to demand higher prices these vehicle acquisition factors caused a 05 increase in our cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue compared to 2010 these effects were partially offset by reductions in our wholesale salvage costs as a percentage of revenue as the impact of rising vehicle costs driven by higher demand for salvage vehicles was offset by our increased recovery on cores and benefits of a net increase in scrap prices over prior year levels 

gross margin as a percentage of revenue gross margin decreased to 426 from 443 the decrease in our gross margin percentage was due primarily to the factors noted in revenue and cost of goods sold above 

facility and warehouse expenses as a percentage of revenue facility and warehouse expenses declined to 90 of revenue in 2011 from 95 in 2010 the decrease was driven by a reduction in personnelrelated expenses as a percentage of revenue which fell to 49 compared to 53 in the prior year as we expanded our product offerings through acquisitions in complementary business lines during 2011 we were able to leverage the fixed component of facility and warehouse expenses such as personnel costs as we integrated the acquisitions into our existing business the decrease in facility and warehouse expenses as a percentage of revenue was also partially a result of higher other revenue which grew at a greater rate than personnel expenditures 

distribution expenses distribution expenses as a percentage of revenue increased by 02 compared to 2010 as higher fuel and freight costs offset benefits from improved utilization of our distribution employees and equipment rising fuel prices increased fuel expense to 14 of revenue in 2011 compared to 12 in the prior year higher fuel prices also impacted third party freight expense which increased to 14 of revenue in 2011 from 12 in 2010 these increases were partially offset by improved leveraging of our distribution network including our personnel expenditures and equipment costs in a period of growing revenue and higher other revenue that did not require additional distribution expenditures 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue our selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 120 in 2011 from 126 in 2010 the decline in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by improved utilization of these costs in a period of rising revenue including increased revenue from scrap metal and other metals that did not require additional selling or administrative expenditures the decrease in these costs as a percentage of revenue included a reduction in selling expenses from 71 of revenue to 68 of revenue our general and administrative expenses which include corporate overhead professional fees and information technology expenses decreased from 55 of revenue to 52 of revenue 

restructuring and acquisition related expenses in 2011 we incurred 76 million of restructuring and acquisition related expenses compared to 07 million in 2010 our 2011 expenses include 40 million related to integrating our acquisition of the akzo nobel paint business in the second quarter of 2011 and our 2010 acquisition of cross canada a canadian aftermarket business we also incurred 04 million of integration costs related to certain of our other acquisitions acquisition related expenses which consist of external costs primarily related to our acquisition of ecp effective as of october 1 2011 totaled 32 million in 2011 these acquisition related expenses included professional fees such as accounting legal advisory and valuation services restructuring charges incurred in 2010 included charges related to integration efforts from 2009 acquisitions see note 10 “restructuring and acquisition related expenses” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our restructuring and integration plans 

  

depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization expense was 15 in both 2011 and 2010 our increased levels of property and equipment primarily driven by capital expenditures and acquisitions as well as higher intangible amortization expense were offset by leveraging of our existing facilities to grow revenue and acquisition related revenue growth respectively 

operating income  as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased to 111 in 2011 from 121 in 2011 the decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a decline in gross margin offset by improved leveraging of our operating expenses 

other expense net total other expense net decreased to 257 million in 2011 from 278 million in 2010 in 2011 our net interest expense decreased by 59 million compared to 2010 which was offset by a loss on debt extinguishment of 53 million on march 25 2011 we executed a new senior secured credit agreement and as a result the unamortized balance of debt issuance costs related to the previous credit agreement was written off interest expense decreased due to a reduction in the average effective interest rate on our bank borrowings to 34 in 2011 from 49 in 2010 resulting from lower interest rates under our new credit facility combined with the impact of lower fixed interest rates under our outstanding interest rate swaps compared to the prior year we also recognized a net gain of 14 million related to adjustments to reduce the fair value estimates of our contingent consideration liabilities in 2011 we recognized a 04 million foreign exchange gain compared to a 02 million loss in the prior year the current year gain was related to the weakening of the canadian dollar and the mexican peso partially offset by a strengthening of the british pound 

provision for income taxes  our effective income tax rate in 2011 was 374 compared with 381 in 2010 the lower effective income tax rate in 2011 reflects a benefit of 05 relative to the prior year from our expanding international operations and a 03 reduction in our effective state tax rate our international operations which grew in 2011 with the ecp acquisition contributed to a lower effective tax rate as a larger proportion of our pretax income was generated in lower rate jurisdictions additionally we achieved tax savings from our financing of foreign acquisitions our effective state tax rate declined as a result of a shift in income to lower rate jurisdictions the effective income tax rate for the comparable prior year period included a discrete benefit of 15 million resulting primarily from the revaluation of deferred taxes in connection with a legal entity reorganization while we had no individually significant discrete items in 2011 the total benefit recognized for the year was similar to the benefit from the legal entity reorganization in 2010 

income from discontinued operations net of taxes income from discontinued operations net of taxes was 20 million in 2010 which was primarily the result of a gain of 27 million 17 million net of tax from the sale of two self service retail facilities on january 15 2010 our 2011 results do not include any impact from these discontinued operations as the facilities were closed or sold in the first quarter of 2010 

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

revenue our revenue increased 206 to 25 billion for the year ended december 31 2010 from 20 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in revenue was primarily due to business acquisitions higher volume of products we sold and higher revenue from scrap metal and other metals sales our parts and services organic revenue growth rate was 66 which was composed of 42 organic growth in our recycled products revenue and 82 organic growth in our aftermarket products revenue the higher growth in our aftermarket products organic revenue was driven by greater visibility to aftermarket products by our salvage sales force along with higher inventory levels and improved positioning within our distribution network which created a greater volume of parts available for sale and higher fulfillment rates other revenue had an organic growth rate of 522 primarily attributable to the effects of scrap metal and other metals prices that increased over the prior year combined with higher sales volume we also had a 04 favorable impact on revenue derived from foreign exchange on our canadian operations 

  

cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased 229 from 11 billion in 2009 to 14 billion in 2010 as a percentage of revenue cost of goods sold increased from 547 to 557 the increase in our cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to higher salvage acquisition prices in 2010 combined with an increase in revenue from scrap aluminum which generates lower margins salvage acquisition prices in 2010 increased due to the expiration of the cash for clunkers program and higher overall demand for salvage vehicles at auction the increase in salvage costs and impact of higher relative revenue from scrap aluminum were partially offset by improved aftermarket margins due to price increases and lower costs on aftermarket products due to vendor competition additionally market conditions in our heavyduty truck operations began to improve which resulted in lower heavyduty truck inventory acquisition costs 

gross margin our gross margin increased 179 from 9278 million in 2009 to 10935 million in 2010 our gross margin increased primarily due to increased volume as a percentage of revenue gross margin decreased from 453 to 443 the decrease in our gross margin as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the factors noted above in cost of goods sold 

facility and warehouse expenses facility and warehouse expenses increased 164 from 2011 million in 2009 to 2340 million in 2010 our facility and warehouse expenses increased 329 million primarily due to incremental expenses of 177 million from business acquisitions principally the acquisition of greenleaf in october 2009 and the organic growth of our operations as a percentage of revenue facility and warehouse expenses decreased from 98 to 95 primarily due to higher revenue spread over fixed facility costs 

distribution expenses distribution expenses increased 169 from 1819 million in 2009 to 2127 million in 2010 our distribution expenses increased 308 million primarily due to incremental expenses of 105 million from business acquisitions 68 million of higher fuel costs 53 million of higher labor and laborrelated expenses and 97 million for increased variable expenses such as freight costs and truck rentals resulting from higher parts volume in 2010 partially offset by 17 million lower vehicle insurance and claims cost as a percentage of revenue our distribution expenses decreased from 89 to 86 primarily due to improved leverage of our distribution network including increased revenue from scrap metal and other metals that did not require additional distribution expense 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 121 from 2767 million in 2009 to 3102 million in 2010 our business acquisitions accounted for 116 million of the increase primarily in labor and labor related costs the remaining increase in our selling general and administrative expenses was due primarily to higher labor and labor related expenses of 197 million higher credit card and bank fees of 15 million and higher advertising and promotion expenses of 12 million offset by lower legal and claims costs of 32 million as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses decreased from 135 to 126 primarily due to improved leverage of selling and administrative employees in a period of growing revenue including revenue from scrap metal and other metals that did not require additional selling general and administrative expenditures 

restructuring and acquisition related expenses restructuring expenses decreased 738 to 07 million in 2010 from 26 million in 2009 the restructuring expenses in 2010 were the result of the greenleaf acquisition while 2009 restructuring expense was related to the integration of keystone automotive industries inc into existing lkq operations see note 10 “restructuring and acquisition related expenses” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a further discussion of restructuring and integration activities related to our acquisitions 

depreciation and amortization  depreciation and amortization including that reported in cost of goods sold above increased 107 from 374 million in 2009 to 414 million in 2010 business acquisitions accounted for 22 million of the increase in depreciation and amortization expense while increased levels of property and equipment accounted for the remaining increase as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization decreased from 17 in 2009 to 15 in 2010 

  

operating income  operating income increased 287 from 2314 million in 2009 to 2979 million in 2010 as a percentage of revenue operating income increased from 113 to 121 the increase in operating income as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to improved leveraging of operating expenses over a larger revenue base partially offset by lower gross margins in 2010 due to higher salvage acquisitions costs and higher relative revenue from scrap aluminum as noted in cost of goods sold above 

other income expense total other expense net increased 62 from 261 million in 2009 to 278 million in 2010 the increase in other expense net is primarily due to the absence of a 43 million gain on bargain purchase that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to the greenleaf acquisition partially offset by lower net interest expense our average bank borrowings were approximately 433 million lower in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to voluntary prepayments of our scheduled 2010 repayments combined with our scheduled repayments in addition our average effective interest rate on our bank borrowings was 486 in 2010 compared to 495 in 2009 see note 9 “business combinations” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a further discussion of the acquisition of greenleaf and the related gain on bargain purchase 

provision for income taxes  the provision for income taxes increased 318 from 782 million in 2009 to 1030 million in 2010 our effective income tax rate was 381 in both 2010 and 2009 our effective state tax rate decreased by 07 in 2010 as a result of a shift in income to lower rate jurisdictions the effective rate remained flat compared to the prior year because of the absence of the rate benefit generated from the nontaxable gain on bargain purchase in 2009 the provision for income taxes in both periods was affected by discrete items in 2009 we recognized a 43 million nontaxable gain on bargain purchase related to the greenleaf acquisition which lowered the 2009 effective income tax rate by 08 the 2010 effective tax rate included adjustments related to the revaluation of deferred taxes in connection with a legal entity reorganization in the first quarter 05 decrease to rate and the establishment of valuation allowances on state tax credit carryforwards 02 increase to rate 

income from discontinued operations net of taxes our discontinued operations net of taxes generated 20 million of income in 2010 compared to 04 million in 2009 income from discontinued operations increased primarily due to the gain of 27 million 17 million net of tax from the sale of two self service retail facilities to ssi on january 15 2010 

results of operations—segment reporting 

we have four operating segments wholesale—north america wholesale—europe self service and heavyduty truck our operations in north america which include our wholesale—north america self service and heavyduty truck operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services customers and methods of distribution our wholesale—europe operating segment formed with our acquisition of ecp effective october 1 2011 marks our entry into the european automotive aftermarket business and is presented as a separate reportable segment although the wholesale—europe operating segment shares many of the characteristics of our north american operations we have provided separate financial information as we believe this data would be beneficial to users in understanding our results 

  

the following table presents our financial performance including revenue and earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization “ebitda” from continuing operations by reportable segment for the periods indicated in thousands 

 

 the key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker is ebitda segment ebitda includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment corporate and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage since the european segment was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2011 its usage of the shared corporate and administrative costs has been minimal segment ebitda excludes depreciation amortization interest including loss on debt extinguishment and taxes loss on debt extinguishment is considered a component of interest in calculating ebitda as the writeoff of debt issuance costs is similar to the treatment of debt issuance cost amortization see note 16 “segment and geographic information” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a reconciliation of total ebitda to income from continuing operations 

since we presented a single reportable segment north america until the acquisition of ecp effective october 1 2011 and the north american segment represents 97 of our 2011 segment ebitda the discussion of the consolidated results of operations covers the factors driving the year over year performance of our north american segment results for our european segment will not have a comparative period until the fourth quarter of 2012 based on these considerations we believe discussion of our results of operations at the segment level would not provide additional understanding of our overall performance 

2012 outlook 

we estimate that full year 2012 income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the impact of any restructuring and acquisition related expenses will be in the range of 258 million to 278 million and 172 to 185 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of ongoing liquidity are cash flows from our operations and our credit facility on march 25 2011 we entered into a senior secured credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by jp morgan chase bank na bank of america na rbs citizens na and wells fargo bank na the “original 2011 credit agreement” which was amended on september 30 2011 as amended the “amended and restated 2011 credit agreement” while the representations warranties and covenants under the amended and restated 2011 credit agreement are customary they include limitations and conditions on our ability to among other things incur indebtedness make dividend payments repurchase our stock and make certain investments and also require us to maintain specified financial covenants we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under the amended and restated 2011 credit agreement as of december 31 2011 

  

the initial use of proceeds under the original 2011 credit agreement included payment in full of amounts outstanding under our previous credit agreement under the amended and restated 2011 credit agreement we may borrow up to 14 billion consisting of a 950 million revolving credit facility including up to 500 million available in foreign currencies and up to 450 million of term loan borrowings as of december 31 2011 the outstanding obligations under the facilities were 9014 million composed of 2406 million of term loans and 6607 million of revolver borrowings compared to 5901 million of term loans outstanding at december 31 2010 under the previous credit agreement our acquisition of ecp effective october 1 2011 for which we drew approximately 3256 million contributed to the increase in our outstanding credit facility borrowings our availability under the revolver at december 31 2011 including the impact of outstanding letters of credit of 354 million was 2539 million we do not expect to utilize the revolver as a primary source of funding for working capital needs as we expect our cash flows from operations to be sufficient for that purpose but we do maintain availability as we continue to expand our facilities and network in addition to the availability under the revolving credit facility the amended and restated 2011 credit agreement provides for up to 200 million in incremental term loan borrowings which we drew in january 2012 to pay down a portion of our outstanding revolver borrowings at december 31 2011 cash and cash equivalents totaled 482 million 

borrowings under the amended and restated 2011 credit agreement accrue interest at variable rates which depend on the currency and the duration of the borrowing plus an applicable margin rate the weightedaverage interest rate on borrowings outstanding against the amended and restated 2011 credit agreement at december 31 2011 after giving effect to the interest rate swap contracts in force described in note 6 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k was 259 the decline in our weighted average interest rate in 2011 resulted from lower fixed rates under our outstanding swaps at december 31 2011 compared to the prior yearend and lower margins under the amended and restated 2011 credit agreement of our outstanding credit agreement borrowings of 9014 million and 5901 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 125 million and 500 million were classified as current maturities respectively after giving effect to the additional term loan borrowings in january 2012 our 2012 maturities will be 200 million 

the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds we normally pay for aftermarket product purchases at the time of shipment or on standard payment terms depending on the manufacturer and payment options offered our purchases of aftermarket products totaled approximately 8363 million 5767 million and 5366 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under some direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles we acquired approximately 228000 198000 and 167000 wholesale salvage vehicles in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively in addition we acquired approximately 352000 297000 and 287000 lower cost self service and crush only vehicles in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we also purchased 39000 lower cost self service and crush only vehicles for our discontinued operations in 2009 our heavyduty truck purchases included 6000 4000 and 4000 heavy and mediumduty trucks in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 2118 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 1592 million for the same period of 2010 in 2011 our operating income excluding depreciation and amortization increased by 767 million compared to the prior year additionally our cash interest payments were 61 million lower than the prior year period due primarily to lower effective interest rates under our current secured credit agreement these increases were partially offset by 251 million in higher tax payments primarily driven by the increase in pretax income and a higher net investment in our primary working capital accounts receivables inventory and payables the net cash outflow for our primary working capital accounts increased to 796 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 699 million for the comparable prior year period primarily due to increased inventory purchases partially offset by the timing of cash payments and collections we expect to generate net cash outflows for our working capital accounts into 2012 as we continue to build inventory levels to support our growing revenue levels although at a lesser amount than 2011 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 5716 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 1916 million for the same period of 2010 we invested 4869 million of cash net of cash acquired in 21 acquisitions during 2011 including 2937 million of cash paid net of cash acquired for our acquisition of ecp in the fourth quarter cash payments net of cash acquired for our 20 acquisitions in 2010 totaled 1436 million in january 2010 we completed the sale of two of our self service yards resulting in a cash inflow net of cash sold of 120 million property and equipment purchases were 864 million in the year ended december 31 2011 which is 250 million greater than the property and equipment purchases in 2010 the growth in capital expenditures was driven by an increase in site improvement and capacity expansion projects compared to the prior year as well as expenditures related to planned 2010 projects that carried over into 2011 

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 3114 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 190 million in 2010 in march 2011 we entered into the original 2011 credit agreement under which our initial draw of 5918 million including 2500 million of term loan borrowings and 3418 million of revolver borrowings was used to pay off amounts outstanding under the previous credit facility the amended and restated credit agreement effective september 30 2011 provided additional capacity under our revolving credit facility under which we drew 3256 million to fund our acquisition of ecp in the fourth quarter additionally we made three scheduled term loan payments totaling 94 million in 2011 related to the execution of the original 2011 credit agreement on march 25 2011 and the amended and restated 2011 credit agreement on september 30 2011 we paid 110 million of debt issuance costs during the prior year we had only one required quarterly term loan payment for 75 million due to prepayments made in 2009 cash generated from exercises of stock options provided 119 million and 140 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively the excess tax benefit from sharebased payment arrangements reduced income taxes payable by 80 million and 150 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 1592 million in 2010 compared to 1640 million in 2009 in 2010 our operating income excluding depreciation and amortization increased by 698 million relative to the same period in 2009 which was offset by a higher investment in our primary working capital accounts receivables inventory and accounts payable and higher tax payments of 390 million in 2010 compared to 2009 the net cash outflow for our primary working capital accounts increased from 389 million in 2009 to 699 million in 2010 primarily due to higher inventory purchases our 2010 aftermarket purchases increased due to our expansion of certain product lines and an increase of onhand inventory to meet demand for certain products in 2010 we also purchased a greater volume of wholesale salvage vehicles at higher average prices than 2009 increased sales volume in our recycled and related products and services product category drove increased volume of wholesale salvage vehicle purchases in 2010 as inventory levels were built up to meet demand our 2009 salvage purchase costs also included 20500 lowerpriced cash for clunkers vehicles 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1916 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 1025 million for 2009 in 2010 we invested 1436 million of cash in acquisitions in 2009 we invested 683 million including 388 million for the greenleaf acquisition in october and received net proceeds of 31 million on settlements of purchase price receivables and payables related to earlier acquisitions in 2010 and 2009 we completed the sale of certain of our self service yards resulting in cash inflow net of cash sold of 120 million and 175 million respectively property and equipment purchases were 614 million in 2010 which is 56 million higher than the property and equipment purchases in 2009 

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 190 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 332 million net cash used by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2009 the variance is primarily attributable to debt repayments in 2009 we made our regularly scheduled term loan payments of 149 million and also elected to prepay the first three quarters’ term loan payments for 2010 totaling 224 million as a result of the prepayment in 2009 we had only one quarterly payment required in 2010 for 75 million in 2010 we had no activity on our line of credit borrowings whereas in 2009 we repaid 2009 and earlier line of credit borrowings resulting in a net cash outflow of 67 million repayments of other 

  

debt which primarily consists of notes issued for business acquisitions were 21 million for 2010 compared to 17 million in the prior year cash generated from exercises of stock options provided 140 million and 82 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively the excess tax benefit from stockbased payment arrangements reduced income taxes payable by 150 million and 96 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

as part of the consideration for certain of our business acquisitions completed in 2011 we entered into contingent consideration agreements with the selling shareholders under the terms of the contingent consideration agreements additional payments will be made to the former owners if specified future events occur or conditions are met such as meeting profitability or earnings targets for our acquisition of ecp we are required to pay up to an additional £55 million in the event the business achieves certain ebitda targets during the years ending december 31 2012 and 2013 based on our evaluation of the likelihood of meeting these performance targets we recorded a liability for the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration of 775 million £502 million the acquisition date fair value of our other contingent consideration liabilities totaled 37 million we expect to fund these payments through either cash generated from operations or through draws on our revolving credit facility in addition to these contingent consideration agreements we issued promissory notes in connection with our business acquisitions totaling approximately 342 million 55 million and 12 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the notes bear interest at annual rates of 20 to 40 and interest is payable at maturity or in monthly installments 

we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of distribution centers processing and sales facilities and warehouses through further integration of our facilities and through selected business acquisitions our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions our amended and restated 2011 credit agreement provides additional sources of liquidity to fund acquisitions which we expect will support our strategy to supplement our organic growth with acquisitions 

we believe that our current cash and equivalents cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our amended and restated 2011 credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements however we may from time to time raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements there can be no assurance that additional funding or refinancing of our credit facility if needed will be available on terms attractive to us or at all furthermore any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

2012 outlook 

we estimate that our capital expenditures for 2012 excluding business acquisitions will be between 100 million and 115 million we expect to use these funds for several major facility expansions improvement of current facilities real estate acquisitions and systems development projects maintenance or replacement capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 20 of the total for 2012 we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities for 2012 will be in the range of 250 million to 280 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facility where interest rates are tied to the prime rate the london interbank offered rate or the canadian dealer offered rate in march 2008 we implemented a policy to manage our exposure to variable interest rates on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt instruments through the use of interest rate swap contracts these contracts convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt matching effective and 

  

maturity dates to specific debt instruments all of our interest rate swap contracts have been executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy jp morgan chasebank na bank of america na and rbs citizens na and are denominated in currency that matches the underlying debt instrument net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swap contracts will be included as adjustments to interest expense in our consolidated income statement as of december 31 2011 we held seven interest rate swap contracts representing a total of 

520 million of us dollardenominated notional amount debt £50 million of pound sterlingdenominated notional amount debt and cad 25 million of canadian dollardenominated notional amount debt in total we had 69 and 76 of our variable rate debt on our credit facility at fixed rates at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively these swaps have maturity dates ranging from october 2013 through december 2016 these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and modify the variable rate nature of that portion of our variable rate debt as of december 31 2011 the fair market value of our swaps was a liability of 106 million the value of such contracts is subject to changes in interest rates 

at december 31 2011 we had unhedged variable rate debt of 2792 million using sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of a 100 basis point movement in the interest rate interest expense would change by 28 million over the next twelve months to the extent that we have cash investments earning interest a portion of the increase in interest expense resulting from a variable rate change would be mitigated by higher interest income 

we are also exposed to market risk related to price fluctuations in scrap metal and other metals market prices of these metals affect the amount that we pay for our inventory as well as the revenue that we generate from sales of these metals as both our revenue and costs are affected by the price fluctuations we have a natural hedge against the changes however there is typically a lag between the effect on our revenue from metal price fluctuations and inventory cost changes therefore we can experience positive or negative margin effects in periods of rising or falling metal prices particularly when such prices move rapidly during the first quarter of 2010 the steep increase in metals prices contributed to higher margins as we sold off lower cost inventory acquired in late 2009 the continuing increase in metal prices throughout 2010 and 2011 contributed to increased revenue during the year ended december 31 2011 if market prices were to fall at a greater rate than our salvage acquisition costs we could experience a decline in gross margin rate 

additionally we are exposed to currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket products from foreign countries the majority of our foreign inventory purchases are with manufacturers based in taiwan while our transactions with manufacturers based in taiwan are conducted in us dollars changes in the relationship between the us dollar and the taiwan dollar might impact the purchase price of aftermarket products our aftermarket operations in canada which also purchase inventory from taiwan in us dollars are further subject to changes in the relationship between the us dollar and the canadian dollar our recently acquired aftermarket operations in the united kingdom also source a portion of their inventory from taiwan as well as from other european countries and china resulting in exposure to changes in the relationship of the pound sterling against the euro and the us dollar with our acquisition of ecp in the fourth quarter we began hedging our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations for certain of our purchases for our uk operations as of december 31 2011 we held foreign currency forward contracts on a notional amount of €104 million and 15 million the fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2011 was immaterial we do not currently attempt to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in our north american operations and we may not be able to pass on any price increases to our customers 

other than a portion of our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in the uk we do not attempt to hedge our foreign currency risk related to our foreign operations under the terms of our amended and restated 2011 credit agreement we have amounts outstanding against our revolver facility denominated in pounds sterling for £670 million and canadian dollars for cad 363 million as of december 31 2011 we have elected not to hedge the foreign currency risk related to these borrowings as we generate pound sterling and canadian dollar cash flows that can be used to fund debt payments

 item 1 business tableend overview 

lkq corporation “lkq” or the “company” provides replacement parts components and systems needed to repair vehicles cars and trucks buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers “oems” which are commonly known as oem products new products produced by companies other than the oems which are sometimes referred to as “aftermarket” products recycled products originally produced by oems which we refer to as recycled products used products that have been refurbished and used products that have been remanufactured 

we distribute a variety of products to collision repair shops and mechanical repair shops including aftermarket collision products recycled collision and mechanical products refurbished collision replacement products such as wheels bumpers and lights and remanufactured products such as engines and transmissions we are the nation’s largest provider of aftermarket and recycled products and related services with sales processing and distribution facilities that reach most major markets in the us and canada we are also the largest nationwide provider of refurbished bumper covers and wheels in addition to these full service wholesale operations we operate self service facilities that sell retail recycled automotive products we also sell recycled heavyduty truck products and used heavyduty trucks our business has three operating divisions—wholesale aftermarket and recycled products self service retail products and heavyduty truck products 

we obtain the majority of our aftermarket inventory from auto parts manufacturers and distributors based in the us and taiwan we procure recycled auto products mainly by purchasing salvage vehicles typically severely damaged by collisions and primarily sold at salvage auctions or pools and then dismantling and inventorying the parts the refurbished and remanufactured products that we sell including wheels bumpers bumper covers head and tail lamps and engines originate from parts from the salvage vehicles bought at auctions parts received in trade at collision shops purchasing replacement products from us and damaged parts bought through bulk purchases from core sales companies that collect damaged parts 

the majority of our products and services are sold to collision repair shops also known as body shops and mechanical repair shops we indirectly rely on insurance companies which ultimately pay for the majority of collision repairs of insured vehicles to help drive demand insurance companies tend to exert significant influence in the vehicle repair decision because of their importance to the process we have formed business relationships with certain insurance companies in which we are designated a preferred products supplier 

we provide customers with a value proposition that includes high quality products at lower cost than new oem products extensive product availability due to our regional inventory trading zones and responsive service and quick delivery repair shops and insurance companies benefit because the lower costs for our products 

  

enable many vehicles to be repaired rather than declared total losses the breadth of our product offerings—aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured products—allows us to serve as a “onestop” solution for our customers looking for the most cost effective way to provide quality repairs 

we strive to be environmentally responsible our recycled automotive products provide an alternative to the manufacture of new products which would require the expenditure of significantly more resources and energy and would generate a substantial amount of additional pollution in addition we save landfill space because the parts that we recycle would otherwise be discarded we also collect materials such as fuel and motor oil from the salvage vehicles that we procure and use them in our operations or sell them to other users 

history 

since our formation in 1998 we have grown through internal development and over 100 acquisitions today lkq is the only supplier of aftermarket and recycled automobile products for the collision and mechanical repair industry with a national network and presence 

initially formed through the combination of a number of wholesale recycled products businesses located in florida michigan ohio and wisconsin lkq grew to be a leading source for recycled auto collision and mechanical products we subsequently expanded our product offerings through acquisitions of aftermarket and recycled products suppliers refurbished and remanufactured products manufacturers and suppliers self service retail operations and heavyduty truck recycled products suppliers the most significant increase to our business was through the acquisition of keystone automotive industries inc in october 2007 which at the time of acquisition was the leading domestic distributor of aftermarket products including collision replacement products paint products refurbished steel bumpers plastic bumper covers and alloy wheels 

in 2010 we made 20 acquisitions 16 in the wholesale products business one in the recycled heavyduty truck products business two self service retail operations and one tire recycling business our acquisitions included the purchase of an engine remanufacturer which allowed us to further vertically integrate our supply chain we expanded our product offerings through the acquisition of an automotive heating and cooling component business as well as a tire recycling business our 2010 acquisitions have also enabled us to expand our geographic presence most notably in canada through our purchase of cross canada an aftermarket product supplier 

in january and february 2011 we acquired four businesses an engine remanufacturer an automotive heating and cooling component distributor a wholesale recycled products business and a recycled heavyduty truck business these acquisitions will enable us to expand our market presence and enter new markets additionally with our purchase of the engine remanufacturer we will continue to build on our presence in the remanufacturing industry while our acquisition of the automotive heating and cooling component distributor supplements our expansion into the heating and cooling aftermarket products market 

strategy 

we are focused on creating economic value for our stockholders by enhancing our position as a leading source for alternative collision and mechanical repair products and by expanding into other product lines and businesses that may benefit from our operating strengths such as recycled heavyduty truck products and the engine remanufacturing business we believe a supply network with a broad inventory of quality alternative collision and mechanical repair products high fulfillment rates and superior customer service will provide us with a competitive advantage other than oems the competition in the markets which we serve is extremely fragmented and the supply of products tends to be localized often leading to low fulfillment rates particularly with recycled products the aftermarket and recycled distribution channels have historically been distinct and separate despite serving the same customer segment we have brought these two channels together to provide our customers with a broader product offering to execute our strategy we are expanding our network of dismantling 

  

plants and warehouses in major metropolitan areas and employing a distribution system that allows for order fulfillment from regional warehouses located across the us and canada by continuing to grow our recycled product inventory complemented by a broad supply of aftermarket products and efficiently moving the inventory within our network we have increased fulfillment rates beyond the levels that we believe most of our competitors realize particularly for recycled products 

sources of high quality reliable alternatives to oem products are important to insurance companies and to our direct customers as they seek to control repair costs lower parts costs and quicker completion of orders saves money and reduces cycle times we believe this strategy is applicable to both the automobile and heavyduty truck markets in order to execute this strategy and build on our progress thus far we will continue to seek to expand into new markets and to improve penetration both organically and through acquisitions in targeted markets 

national network in place 

lkq has invested significant capital to develop a national network of aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured product facilities the difficulty and time required to obtain proper zoning as well as dismantling and other environmental permits necessary to operate newlysited recycled product facilities would make establishing a new network of locations a challenge for a competitor in addition there are difficulties associated with recruiting and hiring an experienced management team that has strong industry knowledge 

we believe there are growth opportunities in new primary and secondary markets in the us and canada we intend to expand our market coverage through a combination of internal development and acquisitions in new regions and adjacent markets our national network allows us to initially enter new adjacent markets by establishing local redistribution facilities avoiding the need for significant upfront capital outlays to establish local dismantling capabilities and inventories 

strong business relationships 

we have developed business relationships with automobile insurance companies collision and mechanical repair shops suppliers and other industry participants we believe that insurance companies as payers for many repairs are increasingly taking more active roles in the selection of alternative replacement products for vehicle repairs in order to contain the repair portion of the claims costs on behalf of certain insurance companies we provide a review of vehicle repair estimates so they may assess the opportunity to increase usage of alternative products in the repair process thereby reducing their costs our employees also provide quotes for our products to assist several insurance companies with their estimate and settlement processes we also work with insurance companies and vehicle manufacturers to procure salvage vehicles directly from them on a selected basis which provides us with an additional source of supply and offers lower transaction costs to sellers of low value salvage vehicles we believe we are positioned to take advantage of the increasing importance these industry participants have in the repair process and will continue to look for ways to enhance our relationships with them 

we provide quality assurance programs that offer additional product support to auto insurance companies these product support programs identify specific subsets of aftermarket products by vendor and product type that can be used in the repair of vehicles that these companies insure the programs typically offer aftermarket products that have been produced by manufacturers certified by a third party testing lab we may provide additional validation of the quality of the products beyond our standard warranties and identification details that make the products traceable back to a manufacturer’s specific production run 

to strengthen our relationship with collision shops we have developed “keyless” a program that enables collision repair shops to link their estimating systems with our aftermarket and recycled inventory it is compatible with all of the major estimating systems and provides realtime inventory availability the system encourages the use of alternative products by indicating to the collision shop the availability of applicable alternative products at the time of the estimate it also provides demand information to our purchasing department and offers sales leads for our sales representatives 

  

technology driven business processes 

we focus on technology development as a way to support our competitive advantage we believe that we can more cost effectively leverage our data to make better business decisions than our smaller competitors we continue to develop our technology to better manage and analyze our inventory assist our salespeople with uptodate pricing and availability of our products and further enhance our inventory procurement process for example our representatives responsible for procuring vehicles are equipped with handheld computing devices that compare the vehicles at the salvage auctions to our current inventory historical demand and recent average prices to arrive at an estimated maximum bid this bidding system reduces the likelihood of purchasing unneeded parts that might result in obsolete inventory 

we deploy inventory management systems at our facilities that are similar to those used by leading distribution companies we make extensive use of bar code technology and wireless data transmission to track parts from the time a vehicle or product arrives at a facility to its placement on a route truck for delivery to the customer all of our aftermarket locations run on a standard operating platform in the third quarter of 2010 we completed a rollout of lkq x at our domestic locations a proprietary software system that simplifies the sales process of both recycled and aftermarket products for our sales representatives in addition we are implementing a new pointofsale system for our selfservice operations that improves the reliability of our self service operations both lkq x and our selfservice pointofsale system provide enhanced data for management reporting and analysis in 2010 we also completed the implementation of an enterprise system for our heavyduty truck operations this system provides visibility across our plants allowing for improved sales by reducing lost sales due to stockouts 

demand driven procurement 

we believe efficient procurement of aftermarket products and salvage vehicles is critical to the growth of the operating results and cash flow of our business we use information systems and proprietary methodologies to help us identify high demand aftermarket and recycled products our aftermarket inventory system tracks products sold and sales lost due to a lack of inventory and makes purchase recommendations the inventory system also recommends purchases and transfers based on the extent and location of demand our buying team reviews the recommendations and places orders accordingly when we procure aftermarket products or refurbish wheels bumpers and lights we focus on products that are in the most demand by the insured repair market our most popular aftermarket products are head lamps tail lamps grilles hoods mirrors bumpers bumper covers and fenders because lead times may take 45 days or more on imported products sales volume and instock inventory are important factors in the procurement process 

our information systems prioritize and recommend bid prices of the salvage vehicles we evaluate for purchase our processes and systems help to identify with a high degree of accuracy the value of the parts that can be recycled on a salvage vehicle and recommend a maximum purchase price to achieve our target margins from the resale of the recycled products we also use historical sales records of vehicles by model and year to estimate the demand for our products combining this information with proprietary data that aggregate customer requests for products we are able to source aftermarket products and salvage vehicles at prices that we believe will allow us to sell products profitably

we have increased local inventory levels and found that it has improved our customer service and allowed for faster deliveries for both our aftermarket and recycled products operations improving local order fulfillment rates reduces transfer costs and delivery times and improves customer satisfaction our ability to share inventory on a regional basis increases the availability of replacement products and also helps us to fill a higher percentage of our customers’ requests we have developed regional trading zones within which we make our inventory available to our local facilities mostly via overnight product transfers we manage our purchasing and recycled product inventory on a regional basis to enhance the availability of the products that we believe will be in the highest demand within each region we believe that our higher than industry average fulfillment rates distinguish us from our competition 

  

broad product offering 

the breadth and depth of our inventory reinforces lkq’s ability to provide a “onestop” solution for our customers’ aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured product needs customers place a high value on the availability of a broad range of vehicle replacement products we are able to provide the collision and mechanical repair industry with premium products at costs typically 20 to 50 below new oem replacement products the availability of alternative products means that automobiles can be repaired at lower costs and leads to more cars being repaired rather than designated as ‘total losses’ by insurance companies in fact many insurance companies will not authorize the use of higher cost new oem replacement products if alternative products are available our ability to supply these products gives insurance companies the confidence to designate lkq as the preferred supplier for their repair shops with our national footprint and comprehensive repair products programs in most of the major us markets we believe we are the only supplier that is able to support the insurance industry in this manner our aftermarket product offering is particularly broad with more than 75000 skus in order to address the multiple needs of our aftermarket customers we offer our platinum plus line of high quality products with lifetime warranties our value line of aftermarket products when cost is the main factor for vehicle repairs and products certified by independent organizations such as the certified automotive parts association “capa” and nsf international “nsf” we offer other products including paint and related repair materials like tape sandpaper paint guns and frame racks so that our customers can purchase these at the same time as they are ordering their automotive repair products 

one call away 

to execute our strategy of offering a broad inventory with high fulfillment rates we offer our customers the choice of aftermarket or recycled products for many parts we also offer refurbished or remanufactured product options if for example a customer has a damaged bumper we may offer that customer the choice of a recycled bumper a new aftermarket bumper or a refurbished bumper because recycled products are in limited supply our ability to offer additional alternative product options increases our fulfillment rates and customer satisfaction historically there have been separate supply channels in the industry for recycled and aftermarket products however we are combining the channels through the sharing of warehousing inventory sales and distribution systems so that our repair shop customers need only one source of supply for their alternative repair products 

wholesale auto products 

our wholesale automobile product operations are comprised of aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured product operations we are organized by geographic regions serving the us and canada that sell all four product types to collision and mechanical automobile repair businesses 

our aftermarket products business is conducted from facilities that may include sales warehousing and distribution centers as of december 31 2010 we conducted our aftermarket product distribution from 166 facilities in the us and canada 

we process salvage vehicles and warehouse recycled products at facilities throughout the us and canada a typical facility has processing sales distribution and administrative operations on site indoor and outdoor storage areas and includes a large warehouse with multiple bays to dismantle vehicles we also have facilities that operate primarily as redistribution centers as of december 31 2010 we conducted our wholesale recycled product operations from 97 facilities 80 of which included a combination of processing sales and redistribution operations and 17 of which were primarily redistribution facilities 

we refurbish bumpers and wheels at 53 locations in the us and canada and one location in northeast mexico we refurbish head lamps and tail lamps primarily at a facility in michigan in 2010 we purchased an engine remanufacturing business in missouri our 2011 acquisitions included an engine remanufacturer with locations in the us and mexico our refurbished and remanufactured products are primarily distributed through our wholesale aftermarket and recycled product facilities 

  

wholesale aftermarket products 

we distribute more than 75000 skus of aftermarket collision products and repair materials for the most common models of domestic and foreign automobiles and light trucks generally for the ten most recent model years our principal aftermarket product types consist of those most frequently damaged in collisions including automotive body panels bumpers grilles and lights we also sell cooling products paint and other materials used by collision repair shops the sources for our aftermarket products are both foreign and domestic manufacturers and distributors 

aftermarket products provide the collision repair industry with quality products at prices well below new oem replacement products lower costs may help insurers contain collision repair costs and often mean that cars are considered repairable rather than categorized as total losses 

we distribute paint and other materials used in repairing damaged vehicles including sandpaper abrasives masking products and plastic filler the paint and other materials distributed by us are purchased from numerous domestic suppliers certain of these products are distributed under the brand “keystone” 

platinum plus is our exclusive brand offered in the keystone product line of aftermarket products it offers high quality products at lower costs than new oem replacement products the platinum plus products are held to high quality standards and tested by quality teams we provide a warranty for as long as a consumer owns the vehicle on which the product was installed many of our platinum plus products are used for repairs that are ultimately paid for by insurance companies and are part of our quality assurance programs 

capa and nsf are associations that evaluate the functional equivalence of aftermarket collision replacement products to oem collision replacement products members of capa and nsf include insurance companies product distributors including lkq collision repair shops and consumers 

capa and nsf develop engineering specifications for aftermarket collision replacement products based upon examinations of oem products certify the factories manufacturing processes and quality control procedures used by independent manufacturers and certify the materials fit and finish of specific aftermarket collision replacement products many major insurance companies have adopted policies recommending or requiring the use of products certified by capa or nsf when available a number of capa and nsf certified products are also marketed under the platinum plus brand 

we distribute parts certified by capa and nsf and actively participate with capa nsf insurance companies and consumer groups in encouraging independent manufacturers of collision replacement products to seek certifications from these organizations 

we have developed a product line called “value line” for more value conscious often selfpay consumers our value line products offer quality products at reasonable prices providing additional choices for repairs or rebuilding of vehicles the value line product line is available for most product categories 

procurement of inventory 

the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from independent manufacturers located primarily in taiwan and the us in 2010 we purchased 12 of the aftermarket products we sell from each of two manufacturers no other suppliers provided more than 7 of our supply of aftermarket products we believe we are one of the largest customers of each of the ten largest suppliers we purchased approximately 48 of our aftermarket products directly from manufacturers in taiwan and other asian countries approximately 52 of our aftermarket products were purchased from locations in the us however the majority of these products were manufactured in taiwan and other asian countries 

we benefit from an automated procurement system that makes order and inventory transfer recommendations using product sales and data for lost sales due to stockouts buyers review the system’s 

  

recommendations and then place purchase orders or arrange for a redistribution of inventory to areas of higher demand for new products we use vehicle volume and registrations by state to influence what new products should be ordered and where the stock should be located typically six months after the products are introduced the automated system has sufficient data to make order recommendations 

we have business arrangements with manufacturers to produce our platinum plus products these agreements automatically renew for additional 12 month periods unless written notice is given while we compete with other distributors for production capacity we believe that our sources of supply and our relationships with our suppliers are satisfactory 

for orders from domestic suppliers we usually receive orders within ten days orders placed with foreign manufacturers generally are received within 45 to 60 days 

foreign orders typically are shipped in sea containers directly to 84 of our 166 aftermarket locations we have 27 regional hubs and one master warehouse located in michigan the hub warehouses act as sources for our other noncontainer direct aftermarket warehouse locations and serve as the central stocking point of all slower moving items which allows all branches to have a high fillrate of next day availability this structure enables us to provide higher fulfillment rates 

wholesale recycled products 

wholesale recycled collision and mechanical products provide high quality lowerprice repair options our most popular recycled products include engines transmissions doors front end assemblies trunk lids bumper assemblies head and tail lamp assemblies and mirrors some insurance companies mandate that the recycled products must be of the same model year or newer as the vehicle being repaired as a result the products we sell are typically from vehicles not more than ten years of age we have adopted the industry’s grading system based on the condition of the product and factor product grades into our pricing decisions unlike aftermarket products that are individually boxed recycled products are most frequently sold as subassemblies or as multiple parts already put together installing recycled products often means that collision shops not only save on product cost but because several products may come preassembled are able to reduce labor costs 

procurement of inventory 

in 2009 nearly 11 million of the more than 255 million vehicles registered in the us became end of life vehicles “elv” and were retired from use for reasons including age damage malfunction or abandonment we procure recycled products for our wholesale operations by acquiring severely damaged or totaled vehicles vehicles that have been declared “total losses” typically are sold at regional salvage auctions held throughout the country salvage auctions charge fees both to the suppliers of vehicles primarily insurance companies and to the purchasers such as lkq additionally we pay third parties fees to tow the vehicles from the auction to our facilities 

over the past few years the frequency with which vehicles are declared total losses has increased as a result¸ we believe of the rise in repair costs relative to used car values as oems offer models that have increasingly complex safety measures such as multiple airbags and vehicle operating sensors the cost to repair such vehicles has risen in 2010 high used car values may have reduced the effect of this trend slightly 

in 2010 lkq acquired approximately 198000 salvage vehicles for our wholesale recycled product operations with approximately 97 purchased at salvage auctions our salvage buyers typically visit the auction sites or review the auctions online in advance of scheduled auction dates to investigate the vehicles to be sold and determine our interest in buying them they obtain key information such as the model and mileage and perform visual damage assessments to determine which parts on the targeted vehicles are recyclable with the data from this preview we deploy a bidding system that performs a valuation calculation for each vehicle the calculation 

  

incorporates demand for a vehicle’s recyclable parts current inventory levels average selling prices auction costs projected margins and instances of outofstock and recommends a maximum bid price bids are then placed on those vehicles that contain desirable parts the system provides a disciplined supply and demand procurement approach that focuses on vehicles for which there is greatest demand 

we acquired approximately 3 of the salvage vehicles we purchased for wholesale parts in 2010 directly from insurance companies vehicle manufacturers and other direct sellers these arrangements eliminate the fees charged to the buyers and sellers by the salvage auction often providing inventory with a lower initial expenditure of capital direct purchase agreements while usually beneficial have limited applicability to our procurement because of the volume of vehicles we buy purchasing vehicles at auction provides us with the flexibility to focus on sought after vehicles based on our bidding algorithms 

vehicle processing 

vehicle processing for our wholesale recycled operations involves dismantling a salvage vehicle into recycled products that are ready for sale when a salvage vehicle arrives at one of our facilities an inventory specialist identifies catalogs and schedules the vehicle for dismantling prior to dismantling we remove from each vehicle its fluids freon and parts containing hazardous substances and precious metals such as catalytic converters the extracted fluids are stored in bulk and subsequently sold to recyclers in the case of gasoline the fuel retrieved is primarily used to power our delivery vehicles a small portion of the recycled motor oil we collect is used at certain of our plants that have highefficiency oil burning furnaces the balance is sold to motor oil recyclers 

when ready for dismantling each vehicle will have an inventory report that indicates to the dismantler which parts should be removed and placed in a warehouse for future sales to customers which parts should be collected in bulk for sale to parts remanufacturers and which parts have value but for now should remain on the vehicle 

products that are placed directly on our shelves are typically higher sales volume items such as engines transmissions doors hoods trunk lids head and tail lamp assemblies and front and rear bumpers many of the recycled products we sell are subassemblies of multiple parts including quarter panels and front end assemblies the subassemblies are cut from the vehicle bodies usually using specific parameters provided by the repair shop at the time of sale 

parts that are not in a condition to be sold as recycled products or that are in surplus supply are separated and sold in bulk to parts remanufacturers or otherwise refurbished or remanufactured internally bumpers and lighting items are sent to our refurbishing facilities while wheels may be sent either to our refurbishing facilities or our smelter operations with our acquisition of an engine remanufacturer in 2010 we also remanufacture highdemand engines 

if there is strong demand for products that are currently at high stock levels in our warehouses we may choose to hold the vehicle for further dismantling at some future date when we are more likely to have a need for the parts the holding period for partially dismantled car bodies will depend on the rack space available at the site once all of the parts of value have been removed the remaining vehicle frame is crushed and sold to scrap processors 

prior to placement on our warehouse shelves each inventory item is given a unique bar code tag for identification and entered into our inventory tracking system we utilize bar coding systems and wireless transmission to keep track of inventory from the time a product is removed and inventoried to the time it is sold and put on a truck for delivery 

  

refurbished and remanufactured products 

as of december 31 2010 we operated 41 plastic bumper and bumper cover refurbishing plants two chrome bumper plating plants 12 wheel plants one light refurbishing plant and one engine remanufacturing operation most of our refurbished and remanufactured products are sold through our wholesale aftermarket and recycled distribution channels the balance is sold to retail automotive stores wholesale distributors and via internet sales 

the majority of our refurbished and remanufactured products are processed from cores obtained from salvage vehicles purchased by our recycled operations damaged cores collected by our route delivery drivers from vehicles under repair by our customers and from core brokers our sales capacity for these products is limited by the availability of cores to refurbish in addition to the engines we remanufacture inhouse we sell some remanufactured or refurbished mechanical products such as engines and transmissions acquired from other mechanical remanufacturers 

scrap and other materials 

our wholesale recycled product operations generate scrap metal and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that have been dismantled for recycled products and “crush only” elvs acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site in other cases we will hire mobile crushing equipment to crush the vehicles before they are transported to shredders and scrap metal processors damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted by our aluminum smelter operations and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products including wheels 

customers 

we sell our products to wholesale customers that include collision and mechanical repair shops and new and used car dealerships we also generate a portion of our revenue from scrap sales to metal recyclers no single customer accounted for 2 or more of our revenue in 2010 

repair shops and others 

we sell the majority of our wholesale products to collision and mechanical repair shops industry reports estimate there were approximately 44200 collision repair shops including those owned by new car dealerships in the us in 2008 the same reports estimate there were approximately 76700 general including mechanical repair garages but excluding new car dealership service departments in the us in 2008 the majority of these customers tend to be individuallyowned small businesses although there has been a trend toward consolidation resulting in the formation of several national and regional repair companies we also sell our products to automobile dealerships car rental companies and fleet management groups 

insurance companies 

automobile insurance companies wield significant influence on the demand for our products while insurance companies do not pay for our products directly they ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount as a result insurance companies often influence the types of products used in a repair 

our nationwide presence gives us a distinctive ability to service the major automobile insurance companies insurance companies generally operate at a national or regional level the use of our products provides a direct benefit to these companies by lowering the cost of repairs decreasing the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and providing a replacement product that is of high quality and comparable performance to the part replaced 

  

we assist insurance companies by providing high quality aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured products to collision repair shops especially to repair shops that are part of an insurance company’s direct repair program “drp” network our keyless system indicates the availability of alternative products as replacements for damaged oem products this data helps insurance companies monitor the body shops’ compliance with its drp product guidelines that might for instance stipulate the use of the lowest cost products that meet quality specifications in addition in some markets insurance companies are able to dispose of low value total loss vehicles directly to us so they can save the transaction fees associated with selling these vehicles through salvage auctions 

remanufacturers—core sales 

a mechanical part that is unsuitable for sale as a replacement product or is a part for which we currently have an excess supply will typically be sold in bulk shipments to mechanical remanufacturers examples of mechanical products we sell in this manner are engine blocks and heads transmissions starters alternators and air conditioner compressors our sales to remanufacturers tend to be large orders and are dependent on their needs for certain product lines beginning in 2010 certain engines that we previously sold to remanufacturers are retained and remanufactured internally 

sales and marketing 

in the case of repairs paid for as a result of insurance claims which industry publications estimate are approximately 89 of all repairs insurance companies give collision repair shops directives as to what type of replacement products are eligible for reimbursement typically insurance carriers have established a hierarchy or decision tree prioritizing the types of products to be used for repairs first recycled products if available if not aftermarket or refurbished products as alternatives if none of these alternative product types is available the shop may then use new oem replacement products as a body shop looks for products for a repair the sourcing of products typically begins with a call to one of our recycled operations or one of our competitors our recycled sales personnel are encouraged to capture the sale as a “onestop shop” and if recycled products are out of stock to fill orders from our aftermarket or refurbished product inventory to support these efforts we have provided our sales staff with access to both aftermarket and recycled sales systems and we have developed sales incentive programs that encourage cross selling throughout our wholesale operations 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 1750 fulltime sales staff in our wholesale operating segment the full time sales personnel are located at sales desks at our facilities or at one of the regional call centers we operate we deploy a call routing system that redirects overflow calls to alternative call centers typically located within the same region we also operate two other call centers one to support national accounts and the other to support insurance adjusters’ needs and questions our sales personnel are encouraged to initiate outbound calls in addition to the inbound calls they handle our sales staff can use our keyless estimating system to generate sales leads for both aftermarket and recycled products 

we are continually reviewing and revising the pricing of wholesale products our pricing specialists consider factors such as recent demand levels inventory quantity on hand and turnover rates new oem product prices and local competitive pricing with the goal of optimizing revenue we set list prices and then sell items at a discount to list with the discount typically based on volume we may adjust prices during the year in response to material price changes of new oem replacement products 

we believe our commitment to stock inventory in local warehouses supplemented by the inventory sharing system within our regional trading zones improves our ability to meet our customers’ requirements more frequently than our competitors and gives us a competitive advantage 

  

distribution 

we have a distribution network of 278 wholesale plants and warehouses across the us and canada of which 31 function as large hub or cross dock facilities our network of facilities allows us to develop and maintain our relationships with local repair shops while providing a level of service that is made possible by our nationwide presence our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries as required by our customers using drivers who routinely deliver to the same customers our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network 

we have developed an internal distribution network to allow our sales representatives to sell aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured products from inventory within regional trading zones thus improving our ability to fulfill customer requests and accelerating inventory turnover each weekday we operate approximately 200 transfer runs between our cross dock facilities and our plants and warehouses within our regional trading zones to redistribute aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured products for delivery on the next day in addition we have approximately 2700 local delivery routes serving our customers each weekday 

each sale results in the generation of a work order at the location housing the specific product a dispatcher is then responsible for ensuring fulfillment accuracy printing the final invoice and including the product on the appropriate truck route for delivery to the customer in markets where we offer aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured products we have begun to integrate the delivery of multiple product types on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs and improve customer service we operate a delivery fleet of mediumsized trucks and smaller trucks and vans over time our delivery vehicles will become more consistent as we reconfigure the fleet to include vehicles that can carry all four product types 

competition 

we consider all suppliers of vehicle collision and mechanical products to be competitors including aftermarket suppliers other recycling businesses refurbishing operations parts remanufacturers oems and internetbased suppliers we do not consider retail chains that focus on the doityourself market to be our direct competitors we believe the principal areas of differentiation in our industry include availability of inventory pricing product quality and service 

the aftermarket product distribution business is highly fragmented and our competitors other than oems are generally independently owned distributors with one to three distribution centers similarly we compete with domestic vehicle product recyclers most of which are singleunit operators in some markets smaller competitors have organized affiliations to share marketing and distribution resources including internet sites we compete with the aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured product distributors on the basis of service our nationwide distribution system our product lines our relationships with certain insurance companies and to a lesser extent price 

manufacturers of new original equipment products sell the majority of automobile replacement products we believe however that as the insurance and repair industries continue to recognize the advantages of aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured products the alternatives to new oem replacement products will account for a larger percentage of total vehicle replacement product sales since 2000 alternative parts usage has increased from approximately 23 to 37 of the collision replacement product market we compete with oems on the basis of price service and product quality 

self service retail 

our self service retail operations sell parts from older cars and light trucks directly to consumers in addition to revenue from the sale of parts core and scrap we charge a small admission fee to access the property our self 

  

service facilities typically consist of a fenced or enclosed area of several acres with vehicles stored outdoors and a retail building through which customers are able to access the yard as of december 31 2010 we conducted our self service retail operations from 43 facilities in north america 

inventory 

we acquire inventory for our self service retail product operations from a variety of sources including but not limited to towing companies municipality sales auctions insurance carriers charitable organizations and the general public we typically procure salvage vehicles that are more than eight model years old for our self service retail recycled product operations these vehicles will typically be older and of lower quality than the salvage vehicles we purchase for our wholesale recycled product operations in 2010 we purchased approximately 297000 lower cost self service and crush only vehicles 

processing and placement 

vehicles are typically delivered to our locations by the seller though in some cases we will arrange for transportation once on our property minimal labor is required to process the vehicle other than removing the fluids catalytic converters and hazardous materials vehicles are then put out in the yard for customers to remove parts the vehicle inventory is usually organized according to domestic and foreign cars passenger vans and trucks in our self service business availability of a specific part will depend on which vehicles are currently at the site and to what extent parts may have previously been removed and sold 

part prices are listed on regularly updated price sheets and will vary by part type but not by make or model for instance four cylinder engines are priced the same amount regardless of vehicle make model age or condition the revenue sources from these operations are the sale of parts the entrance fees the sale of the cores and other metals and the scrap of the crushed car bodies of the vehicle after the sale parts have been removed we usually allow customers access to vehicles for 30 to 60 days before they are crushed and sold to scrap metal processors 

scrap and other materials 

our self service auto recycling operations generate scrap metal and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that are no longer available to the public and “crush only” vehicles acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site 

customers 

the customers of our self service yards are frequently doityourself mechanics small independent repair shops servicing older vehicles and auto rebuilders 

competition 

there are competitors operating self service businesses in all of the markets in which we operate in some markets there are numerous competitors often operating in close proximity to our operations we try to differentiate our business by the quality of the inventory and the size and cleanliness of the property 

heavyduty trucks 

lkq started its heavyduty recycled truck product operations in 2008 with the purchase of a recycler based in houston texas as of december 31 2010 we had a total of 11 facilities located in the us canada and mexico we began our recycled truck operations with a belief that development of a network would offer similar opportunities to those we have experienced with our wholesale recycled product operations 

  

our inventory is comprised of used heavy and mediumduty trucks usually from 2004 or earlier which are purchased at salvage and truck auctions or directly from insurance companies or large fleet operators during 2010 we purchased approximately 4000 vehicles depending on the condition of the vehicles they may be resold as running vehicles or dismantled for parts the vehicles that are acquired for resale are typically special purpose or vocational use trucks such as those used for garbage pickup or cement delivery if requested by the sellers of the vehicles we provide an assurance that the vehicles will be sold to foreign buyers and exported to countries for use outside of the us or to domestic buyers after the vehicles have been reconditioned and modified for use other than their original purpose 

customers 

customers for the recycled products are often owneroperators local cartage companies operating small fleets or foreign buyers seeking low cost parts most commonly engines and transmissions newer products will often be sold to insurance companies for use in an insured’s vehicle we also sell products and running vehicles to exporters 

employees 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 12000 employees we are a party to a collective bargaining agreement with a union that represents approximately 110 employees at our totowa new jersey facility approximately 420 of our employees at our bumper refurbishing plant in mexico and approximately 170 of our employees at our recycled parts facility in quebec city canada are also represented by unions other than these locations none of our employees is a member of a union or participates in other collective bargaining arrangements we consider our employee relations to be good 

facilities 

our corporate headquarters are located at 120 north lasalle street suite 3300 chicago illinois 60602 the lease for our corporate headquarters expires in july 2011 at which time we are scheduled to move to a leased facility at 500 west madison street chicago illinois 60606 in addition to our corporate headquarters we also have regional offices throughout the us all of which perform corporate functions we are in the process of transferring from the regional corporate offices to a financial services support center in nashville tennessee certain corporate functions previously performed regionally including accounting procurement and information systems support we expect this transition to be completed in 2011 in addition to our corporate offices we have numerous operating facilities that handle wholesale self service retail and heavyduty truck products we operate out of more than 325 locations in total a majority of these locations are leased some of our locations stock multiple product types or serve more than one function 

included in our total locations are five facilities in central america 30 facilities in canada and two facilities in mexico 

information technology 

in 2010 we completed the installation of a proprietary facility management system called lkq x at our domestic locations that we developed for our wholesale recycled product operations to replace a third party system the new system improves the integration of inventory with the aftermarket system and provides improved control selling and data analysis features we believe that a single system that presents a combined view of aftermarket recycled refurbished and remanufactured products helps facilitate the sales process allows for continued implementation of standard operating procedures and yields improved training efficiency employee transferability access to our national inventory database management reporting and data storage it also eliminates the need to create multiple versions of proprietary applications and systems support processes the system also supports an electronic exchange process for identifying and locating parts at other select recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock 

  

we use a single third party facility management system in our aftermarket operations additional third party software packages have been implemented to leverage the centralized data and information that a single system provides such as a data warehouse to conduct enhanced analytics and reporting an integrated budgeting system an electronic data interchange tool and ecommerce tools to enhance our online businesstobusiness initiatives—orderkeystonecom and keyless 

all of our refurbishing operations use a single facility management system in 2010 we standardized our pointofsale systems used in our self service retail operations which allows for improved system reliability and enhanced management reporting we also implemented in 2010 a single enterprise system for all of our heavyduty truck operations that supports interregion sales to reduce the potential for lost sales due to outofstock parts 

the hardware that supports the systems used in our wholesale self service and heavy duty truck operations is located in offsite data centers the centers are in secure environments with aroundtheclock monitoring redundant power backup and multiple diverse data and telecommunication routing 

we use separate third party provided software for our financial systems such as financial and budget reporting general ledger accounting accounts payable payroll and fixed assets we currently protect our local customer inventory and corporate consolidated data such as financial information email files and other user files with daily backups these backups are stored off site with a third party data protection vendor 

we continually evaluate our systems with the goal of ensuring that all critical systems remain scalable and operational as our business grows 

regulation 

environmental compliance 

our operations and properties including the maintenance of our delivery vehicles are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations these environmental laws govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials 

we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters we have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements we cannot assure you however that we will at all times be in complete compliance with such requirements 

although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot assure you that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

contamination resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release storage transportation or disposal of gasoline motor oil antifreeze transmission fluid chlorofluorocarbons “cfcs” from air conditioners other hazardous materials or metals such as aluminum cadmium chromium lead and mercury contamination from the refurbishment of chrome plated bumpers can occur from the release of the plating material contamination can migrate onsite or offsite which can increase the risk and the amount of any potential liability 

  

in addition many of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use that may have involved hazardous materials as a result some of our properties may be contaminated some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination even if these owners or operators did not know of and were not responsible for such contamination these environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of treats or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties or successors to such owners or operators for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 

when we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process we analyze the risks and when appropriate perform further environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination furthermore where appropriate we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters in addition at times we or sellers from whom we purchased a business have undertaken remediation projects we do not anticipate based on currently available information and current laws that we will incur liabilities in excess of reserves to address environmental matters however in the event we discover new information or if laws change we may incur significant liabilities which may exceed our reserves 

title laws 

in some states when a vehicle is deemed a total loss a salvage title is issued whether states issue salvage titles is important to the supply of inventory for the vehicle recycling industry because an increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles currently these titling issues are a matter of state law in 1992 the us congress commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle titling registration and salvage since then legislation has been introduced seeking to establish national uniform requirements in this area including a uniform definition of a salvage vehicle the vehicle recycling industry will generally favor a uniform definition since it will avoid inconsistencies across state lines and will generally favor a definition that expands the number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage however certain interest groups including repair shops and some insurance associations may oppose this type of legislation national legislation has not yet been enacted in this area and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in the future 

anticar theft act 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any “covered major part” the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on vehicle recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may further discourage the use by such shops of recycled products there is no pending initiative to implement the parts registration from a law enforcement point of view however there is a risk that a heightened legislative concern over safety of parts might precipitate an effort to push for the implementation of such rules 

legislation affecting automotive repair parts 

most states have laws relating to the use of aftermarket products in motor vehicle collision repair work the provisions of these laws include consumer disclosure vehicle owner’s consent regarding the use of aftermarket products in the repair process and the requirement to have aftermarket products certified by an independent 

  

testing organization some jurisdictions have laws that regulate the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags additional laws of this kind may be enacted in the future an increase in the number of states passing such legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on our business additionally congress could enact federal legislation restricting the use of aftermarket and recycled automotive products used in the course of collision repair 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather related accidents in addition the cost of salvage vehicles tends to be lower as weather related accidents generate a larger supply of total loss vehicles 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend risks relating to our business 

our operating results and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the economic conditions in the us 

the decline in economic conditions in the us adversely impacted our business such conditions have resulted in fewer miles driven fewer accident claims and a reduction of vehicle repairs in the event that the us economic conditions decline further or do not improve we expect that our business will continue to be negatively affected 

we face intense competition from local national international and internetbased vehicle products providers and this competition could negatively affect our business 

the vehicle replacement products industry is highly competitive and is served by numerous suppliers of oem recycled aftermarket refurbished and remanufactured products within each of these categories of suppliers there are local owneroperated companies larger regional suppliers national and international providers and internetbased suppliers providers of vehicle replacement products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of vehicle replacement products which may further increase competition some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise greater financial technical manufacturing distribution and other resources longer operating histories lower cost structures and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries than we do in certain regions of the us local vehicle recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in the wholesale recycled products industry as a result of these factors our competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply provide their products at lower costs or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve 

we believe that substantially in excess of 50 of collision parts by dollar amount are supplied by oems with the balance being supplied by distributors like us the oems are therefore in a position to exert pricing pressure in the marketplace we compete with the oems primarily on price and to a lesser extent on service and quality from time to time oems have experimented with reducing prices on specific products to match the lower prices of alternative products if such price reductions were to become widespread it could have a material adverse impact on our business 

claims by oems relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business 

oems have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims the oems have brought such claims in federal court and with the us international trade commission 

  

in december 2005 and may 2008 ford global technologies llc filed complaints with the international trade commission against us and others alleging that certain aftermarket products imported into the us infringed on ford design patents the parties settled these matters in april 2009 pursuant to a settlement arrangement that expires in september 2011 

us patent and trademark office records indicate that oems are seeking and obtaining more design patents then they have in the past to the extent that the oems are successful with intellectual property infringement claims we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business we will likely incur significant expenses investigating and defending intellectual property infringement claims in addition aftermarket products certifying organizations may revoke the certification of parts that are the subject of the claims lack of certification may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of aftermarket products only if they have been certified by an independent certifying organization 

an adverse change in our relationships with our suppliers or auction companies could increase our expenses and hurt our ability to serve our customers 

we are dependent on a relatively small number of suppliers of aftermarket products most of which are located in taiwan although alternative suppliers exist for substantially all aftermarket products distributed by us the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on us until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced providing products moreover our operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad including among other things transportation costs and delays political instability currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs import and export controls and other nontariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas as well as the uncertainty regarding future relations between china and taiwan because a substantial volume of our sales involves products manufactured from sheet metal we can be adversely impacted if sheet metal becomes unavailable or is only available at higher prices which we may not be able to pass on to our customers 

most of our salvage inventory is obtained from vehicles offered at salvage auctions operated by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the us we do not typically have contracts with any auction company according to industry analysts a small number of companies control a large percentage of the salvage auction market in the us if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions began competing with us or significantly raised its fees our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers moreover we are facing increased competition in the purchase of salvage vehicles from direct competitors rebuilders exporters and others this increase in the number of bidders has increased and may continue to increase our cost of goods sold for wholesale recycled products most states regulate bidders to help ensure that salvage vehicles are purchased for legal purposes by qualified buyers auction companies have been actively seeking to reduce circumvent or eliminate these regulations which would further increase the number of bidders 

we also acquire inventory directly from insurance companies oems and others to the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue these arrangements our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers 

if our business relationships with insurance companies end we may lose important sales opportunities 

we rely on business relationships with several insurance companies these insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide the business relationships include in some cases participation in aftermarket quality and service assurance programs that may result in a higher usage of our aftermarket products than would be the case without the programs our arrangements with these companies may be terminated by them at any time including in connection with their own business concerns relating to the offering availability standards or operations of the aftermarket quality and service assurance programs we rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

in an illinois lawsuit involving state farm mutual automobile insurance company  “avery v state farm”  a jury decided in october 1999 that state farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using nonoem replacement products to repair damaged vehicles when use of such products did not restore the vehicle to its “preloss condition” the jury found that state farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of nonoem replacement products and the alleged inferiority of those products the jury assessed damages against state farm of 456 million and the judge assessed an additional 730 million of disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the illinois consumer fraud act in april 2001 the illinois appellate court upheld the verdict but reduced the damage award by 130 million because of duplicative damage awards on august 18 2005 the illinois supreme court reversed the awards made by the circuit court and found among other things that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any breach of contract by state farm the us supreme court declined to hear an appeal of this case as a result of this case some insurance companies reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket products our financial results could be adversely affected if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled products from us due to a fear of similar claims 

we may not be able to sell our products due to existing or new laws and regulations prohibiting or restricting the sale of wholesale aftermarket recycled or refurbished products 

some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled products restrictions on the products we are able to sell could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

most states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair work andor require enhanced disclosure or vehicle owner consent before using aftermarket products in such repair work additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future if additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business 

certain organizations test the quality and safety of vehicle replacement products in the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product such events could adversely affect our business 

we may not be able to successfully acquire new businesses or integrate acquisitions which could cause our business to suffer 

we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms or for other reasons if we buy a company or a division of a company we may experience difficulty integrating that company’s or division’s personnel and operations which could negatively affect our operating results in addition 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 our credit agreement places restrictions on our business 

in 2007 we entered into a senior secured debt financing facility with a group of lenders our total outstanding indebtedness including bank financing letters of credit and notes payable in connection with acquisitions as of december 31 2010 was 6278 million the credit agreement contains operating and financial restrictions and requires that we satisfy certain financial and other covenants the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit agreement a default if not waived could result in acceleration of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing credit facility or it may be on terms that are not acceptable to us 

our future capital needs may require that we seek debt financing or additional equity funding that if not available could cause our business to suffer 

we may need to raise additional funds in the future to among other things refinance existing debt fund our existing operations improve or expand our operations respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions from time to time we may raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic alliances or other arrangements however the recent turmoil in the credit markets has resulted in tighter credit conditions which could affect our ability to raise additional funds if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and further limitations on our operations if we fail to raise capital when needed our business may be negatively affected 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control future factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to those listed in the special note on forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k accordingly our results of operations may not be indicative of future performance these fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which could cause our stock price or the value of debt instruments to decline 

fluctuations in the prices of metals or shipping costs could adversely affect our financial results 

all of our recycled operations generate scrap metal and other metals that we sell after we dismantle a salvage vehicle for wholesale parts and after vehicles have been used in our self service retail business the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors and other remaining metals are sold to processors and brokers of metals in addition we receive “crush only” vehicles from other companies including oems which we dismantle and which generate scrap metal and other metals the prices of scrap and other metals have historically fluctuated sometimes significantly due to market factors in addition buyers may stop purchasing metals entirely due to excess supply to the extent that the prices of metals decrease materially or buyers stop purchasing metals our revenue from such sales will suffer and a writedown of our inventory value could be 

  

required the cost of our wholesale recycled and our self service retail inventory purchases may also decrease as a result of falling scrap metal and other metals prices however there can be no assurance that our inventory purchasing cost will decrease the same amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal and other metals prices decline and there may be a delay between the scrap metal and other metals price reductions and any inventory cost reductions the price of steel is a component of the cost to manufacture products for our aftermarket business we incur substantial freight costs to import parts from our suppliers many of whom are located in asia if the cost of steel or freight rose we might not be able to pass the cost increases on to our customers 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur significant charges to our pretax income 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations in the future goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of acquisitions goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including modifications that restrict the activities of the acquired business as of december 31 2010 our total goodwill subject to future impairment testing was 10 billion for further discussion of our annual impairment test see “goodwill impairment” in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of item 7 in this annual report on form 10k 

if the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines our business could suffer 

because our business depends on vehicle accidents for both the demand for repairs using our products and the supply of wholesale recycled products factors which influence the number andor severity of accidents including but not limited to the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven the ages of drivers the use of cellular telephones and other electronic equipment by drivers the congestion of traffic the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers the effectiveness of accident avoidance systems in new vehicles and the condition of roadways impact our business in this regard a number of states and municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones while driving and such restrictions could lead to a decline in accidents to the extent oems develop or are mandated by law to install new accident avoidance systems the number and severity of accidents could decrease moreover an increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road to decline and the number of miles driven to decline as motorists seek alternative transportation options and this also could lead to a decline in accidents 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits 

our operating subsidiaries must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations when we develop or acquire a new facility we must seek the approval of state and local units of government governmental agencies may resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling or refurbishing facility in their communities there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold 

if we lose our key management personnel we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives if we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel which could harm our business 

  

we rely on information technology and communication systems in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business 

some of the information technology systems and communication systems we use for management of our facilities and our financial functions are leased from or operated by other companies while others are owned by us in the event that the providers of these systems terminate their relationships with us or if we suffer prolonged outages of these or our own systems for whatever reason we could suffer disruptions to our operations 

in addition we continually monitor these systems to find areas for improvement in the event that we decided to switch providers or to implement our own systems we may also suffer disruptions to our business we may be unsuccessful in the development of our own systems and we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing our own systems also our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system which period could extend longer than we anticipated 

if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks our business could be harmed 

we use a fleet of trucks to deliver the majority of the products we sell we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in the transportation infrastructure governmental regulation availability and price of fuel liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance and insurance premium increases in addition our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials 

we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials 

under certain environmental laws we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at or migration to or from our or our predecessors’ past or present facilities and at independent waste disposal sites these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or was not responsible for the release of such hazardous substances 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we could be subject to product liability claims 

if customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage we could be subject to product liability claims by such customers the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business or financial condition in addition we have agreed to defend and indemnify in certain circumstances insurance companies that could be named as defendants in such lawsuits further such a claim could negatively impact our future revenue 

  

regulations that may be issued under the anticar theft act could harm our business 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any “covered major part” the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on automotive parts recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may further discourage the use of recycled products by such shops 

we operate in canada and mexico which exposes us to foreign exchange and other risks 

we have operations in canada and mexico we are thus subject to foreign exchange exposure as well as exposure to foreign tax and other foreign and domestic laws in addition mexico is currently experiencing a heightened level of criminal activity that could affect our ability to maintain our supply of certain aftermarket products 

risks relating to our common stock and financial structure 

future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 

we and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock or other equity debt or instruments which constitute an element of our debt and equity collectively “securities” in the future we may also issue shares of common stock under our equity incentive plan or in connection with future acquisitions we cannot predict the size of future issuances of securities or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock or other securities will have on the price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued in connection with an acquisition or the perception that such sales could occur may cause the price of our common stock to fall 

delaware law our charter documents and our loan documents may impede or discourage a takeover which could affect the price of our stock 

the antitakeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws our loan documents and delaware law could together or separately impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult our credit agreement provides that a change of control is an event of default our incorporation under delaware law and these provisions could also impede an acquisition takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we provide replacement parts components and systems needed to repair vehicles cars and trucks buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers “oems” which are commonly known as oem products new products produced by companies other than the oems which are sometimes referred to as “aftermarket” products recycled products originally produced by oems which we refer to as recycled products used products that have been refurbished and used products that have been remanufactured 

we distribute a variety of products to collision repair shops and mechanical repair shops including aftermarket collision products recycled collision and mechanical products refurbished collision replacement products such as wheels bumpers and lights and remanufactured products such as engines and transmissions we are the nation’s largest provider of aftermarket and recycled products and related services with sales processing and distribution facilities that reach most major markets in the us and canada we are also the largest nationwide provider of refurbished bumper covers and wheels in addition to these full service wholesale operations we operate self service facilities that sell retail recycled automotive products we also sell recycled heavyduty truck products and used heavyduty trucks we believe there are opportunities for growth in our product lines through acquisitions and internal development 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to those listed in the special note on forwardlooking statements in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k due to these factors our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate accordingly our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance 

acquisitions 

since our inception in 1998 we have pursued a growth strategy of both organic growth and acquisitions we have pursued acquisitions that we believe will help drive profitability cash flow and stockholder value our principal focus for acquisitions is companies that will expand our geographic presence and our ability to provide a wider choice of alternative vehicle replacement products and services to our customers 

in 2010 we made 20 acquisitions 16 in the wholesale products business one in the recycled heavyduty truck products business two self service retail operations and one tire recycling business our acquisitions included the purchase of an engine remanufacturer included in the wholesale operating segment which will allow us to begin vertically integrating our recycled product supply chain we expanded our product offerings through the acquisition of an automotive heating and cooling component business included in the wholesale operating segment as well as a tire recycling business which supports all of our operating segments our 2010 acquisitions have also enabled us to expand our geographic presence most notably in canada through our purchase of cross canada an aftermarket product supplier 

in 2009 we acquired eight businesses five in the wholesale business and three in the recycled heavyduty truck products business the acquisitions enabled us to increase our geographic presence in the wholesale products business and expand our network of recycled heavyduty truck products facilities our 2009 acquisitions included greenleaf auto recyclers llc “greenleaf” which we purchased from schnitzer steel industries inc “ssi” in october this acquisition enabled us to increase our geographic presence and increase our capacity in numerous markets 

in august 2008 we acquired pickyourpart auto wrecking “pyp” an operator of multiple self service facilities in the state of california during 2008 we also acquired seven other businesses four in the wholesale 

  

business and three in the recycled heavyduty truck products business these acquisitions included two businesses in canada the 2008 acquisitions enabled us to expand our presence in existing markets increase our geographic presence in the canadian market and become a provider of recycled heavyduty truck parts 

divestitures 

in october 2009 we sold to ssi four retail oriented self service facilities in oregon and washington we also sold certain business assets to ssi related to two self service retail facilities in northern california and a self service retail facility in portland oregon we have closed the two self service retail facilities in northern california and converted the self service operation in portland to a wholesale recycling business we also agreed to sell to ssi two self service retail facilities in dallas texas and closed this portion of the transaction on january 15 2010 certain of these facilities qualified for treatment as discontinued operations the financial results and assets and liabilities of these facilities are segregated from our continuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income for all periods presented unless otherwise noted this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates only to financial results from continuing operations 

sources of revenue 

we report our revenue in three categories i aftermarket other new and refurbished products ii recycled products and related products and services including remanufactured products and iii other 

our revenue from the sale of vehicle replacement products and related services includes sales of i aftermarket other new and refurbished products and ii recycled products and related products and services in 2010 sales of vehicle replacement products and services represented approximately 86 of our consolidated sales over half of our vehicle replacement products and related services revenue is derived from sales of aftermarket other new and refurbished products prior to 2008 recycled products which includes our wholesale recycled self service and heavyduty truck product operations was our largest sales category in 2010 recycled products sales comprised approximately 42 of our vehicle replacement products and related services sales our 2010 acquisition of an engine remanufacturer will allow us to begin vertically integrating our recycled product supply chain by bringing the engine remanufacturing process in house 

we sell the majority of our vehicle replacement products to collision and mechanical repair shops our vehicle replacement products include engines transmissions frontends doors trunk lids bumpers hoods fenders grilles valances wheels head lamps and tail lamps for an additional fee we sell extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products these contracts cover the cost of parts and labor and are sold for periods of six months one year two years or a nontransferable lifetime warranty we defer the revenue from such contracts and recognize it ratably over the term of the contracts or three years in the case of lifetime warranties the demand for our products and services is influenced by several factors including the number of vehicles in operation the number of miles being driven the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents availability and pricing of new parts seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions additionally automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process accordingly we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our products while they are not our direct customers we do provide insurance carriers services in an effort to promote the increased usage of alternative replacement products in the repair process such services include the review of vehicle repair order estimates direct quotation services to insurance company adjusters and an aftermarket products quality and service assurance program we neither charge a fee to the insurance carriers for these services nor adjust our pricing of parts for our customers when we perform these services for insurance carriers 

there is no standard price for aftermarket recycled refurbished or remanufactured products but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as product availability quality demand new oem replacement product prices the age of the vehicle being repaired and competitor pricing 

  

in 2010 revenue from other sources represented approximately 14 of our consolidated sales these other sources include scrap sales bulk sales to mechanical remanufacturers and sales of aluminum ingots and sows we derive scrap metal from several sources including oems and other entities that contract with us to dismantle and scrap certain vehicles which we refer to as “crush only” vehicles and from vehicles that have been used in both our wholesale and self service recycled operations revenue from scrap sales will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices the speed with which they fluctuate and the volume of vehicles we sell for scrap in 2009 revenue from other sources declined 20 relative to the prior year due to lower scrap metal and other metal prices and a reduction in the volume of crush only vehicles acquired with the rebound in scrap prices in 2010 combined with higher sales volume revenue from other sources increased by 675 

when we obtain mechanical parts from dismantled vehicles and determine they are damaged or when we have a surplus of a certain mechanical product type we sell them in bulk to mechanical remanufacturers the majority of these parts are sorted by part type and model type examples of such parts are engine blocks and heads transmissions starters alternators and air conditioner compressors with our entry into engine remanufacturing in 2010 our sales of engine cores to mechanical remanufacturers will decline in future years 

cost of goods sold 

our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts freight and other inventoried costs such as allocated overhead and import fees and duties where applicable our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors our cost of goods sold for refurbished wheels bumpers and lights includes the price we pay for inventory freight and costs to refurbish the parts including direct and indirect labor rent depreciation and other overhead related to refurbishing operations 

our cost of goods sold for recycled products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and where applicable auction storage and towing fees our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles since 2008 our labor and laborrelated costs related to acquisition and dismantling have accounted for approximately 8 of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle we are facing increasing competition in the purchase of salvage vehicles from shredders and scrap recyclers internetbased buyers and others combined with overall higher demand for used vehicles resulting from the economic decline beginning in late 2008 we have been paying and may continue to pay higher prices for salvage vehicles the acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and as a result energy costs are not material our cost of goods sold for remanufactured products includes the price we pay for cores freight costs to remanufacture the products including direct and indirect labor rent depreciation and other overhead related to remanufacturing operations 

in the event we do not have a recycled product or suitable aftermarket product in our inventory to fill a customer order we attempt to purchase the product from a competitor we refer to these products as brokered products since 2008 the revenue from brokered products that we sell to our customers has ranged from 2 to 5 of our total revenue the gross margin on brokered product sales as a percentage of revenue is less than what we achieve from sales of our own inventory because we must pay higher prices for these products 

some of our salvage mechanical products are sold with a standard sixmonth warranty against defects additionally some of our remanufactured engines are sold with a standard threeyear warranty against defects we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claims information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses we also sell separately priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products the expense related to extended warranty claims is recognized when the claim is made 

expenses 

our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our distribution self service and warehouse facilities these costs include facility rent labor for plant management and facility and warehouse 

  

personnel and related incentive compensation and employee benefits utilities repairs and maintenance costs related to our facilities and equipment other occupancy costs such as real estate and personal property taxes and property and liability insurance the costs included in facility and warehouse expenses do not relate to inventory processing or conversion activities and as such are classified below the gross margin line on our consolidated statements of income 

our distribution expenses include our costs to prepare and deliver our products to our customers included in our distribution expense category are labor costs for drivers fuel local delivery and transfer truck leases or rentals and subcontractor costs vehicle repairs and maintenance supplies and insurance 

our selling and marketing expenses primarily include salary commission and other incentive compensation expenses for sales personnel advertising promotion and marketing costs telephone and other communication expenses credit card fees and bad debt expense since 2008 personnel costs have accounted for approximately 80 of our selling and marketing expenses most of our product sales personnel are paid on a commission basis the number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our customers’ needs and increase our sales volume our objective is to continually evaluate our sales force develop and implement training programs and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness 

our general and administrative expenses primarily include the costs of our corporate office regional offices and financial services center that provide corporate and field management treasury accounting legal payroll business development human resources and information systems functions these costs include wages and benefits for corporate regional and administrative personnel stockbased compensation and other incentive compensation accounting legal and other professional fees office supplies telephone and other communication costs travel and lodging and insurance 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather related accidents in addition the cost of salvage vehicles tends to be lower as more weather related accidents occur generating a larger supply of total loss vehicles 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition inventory valuation business combinations goodwill impairment selfinsurance programs contingencies accounting for income taxes and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue actual results may differ from these estimates

we recognize and report revenue from the sale of vehicle replacement products when they are shipped or picked up and title has transferred subject to a reserve for returns discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information a replacement product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment our customers may earn discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment we analyze 

  

historical returns and allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates we use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold if actual returns and allowances are higher than our historical experience there would be an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence 

for an additional fee we also sell extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products revenue from these contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the contracts or three years in the case of lifetime warranties 

inventory accounting 

aftermarket and refurbished product inventory aftermarket and refurbished product inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market our aftermarket inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for parts and includes expenses incurred for freight and buying where applicable and overhead for items purchased from foreign sources import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included our refurbished product inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for wheel bumper and lamp cores and includes expenses incurred for freight purchasing and refurbishing overhead 

salvage inventory salvage inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle and includes buying dismantling and where applicable auction storage and towing fees inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facility’s inventory at expected selling prices the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility’s historical vehicle profitability for salvage vehicles purchased at auction or from contracted rates for salvage vehicles acquired under direct procurement arrangements remanufactured inventory cost is based upon the average price paid for cores and also includes expenses incurred for freight direct manufacturing costs and overhead 

for our aftermarket and refurbished product inventory and our salvage inventory the carrying value is reduced regularly to reflect the age and current anticipated demand for our products if actual demand differs from our estimates additional reductions to our inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made 

business combinations 

we record our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values we utilize management estimates and in some instances an independent thirdparty valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and contingent consideration granted such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions including projections of future events and operating performance the purchase price allocation is subject to change during the measurement period which is limited to one year subsequent to the acquisition date for acquisitions after january 1 2009 the date on which we adopted accounting standards codification 805 “business combinations” “asc 805” adjustments to the purchase price allocation are recorded retrospectively while for acquisitions prior to our adoption of asc 805 adjustments to purchase price allocation are recorded prospectively 

goodwill impairment 

we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually the determination of the value of goodwill requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of 

  

goodwill we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist during 2010 we did not identify any events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts therefore we did not perform any impairment tests other than our annual test in the fourth quarter of 2010 

we are organized into three operating segments composed of our wholesale aftermarket and recycled products self service retail products and recycled heavyduty truck products we have also concluded that these three operating segments are reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing in 2010 

our goodwill would be considered impaired if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value the fair value estimates are established using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach we believe that using two methods to determine fair value limits the chances of an unrepresentative valuation as of december 31 2010 we had 10 billion in goodwill subject to future impairment tests if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results we determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2010 a 10 decrease in the fair value estimates of the reporting units in the annual impairment test would not have changed this determination 

while the fair value of our heavyduty truck products reporting unit exceeded its book value by more than 10 this reporting unit has a higher degree of uncertainty in the projections than our other units because we entered the heavyduty truck products business relatively recently in 2008 we typically generate lower profit margins in the early years after we enter a new line of business as we build our network and integrate the administrative functions of the acquired businesses our projections included in the valuation reflect our expectations of growth in revenue and profitability as a result of our continued development of our heavyduty truck network the implementation of internal growth strategies and the anticipated recovery from the economic downturn which impacted truck sales through 2010 if our expectations are not realized we could be subject to an impairment of some portion of the reporting unit’s goodwill as of december 31 2010 the reporting unit had a total of 556 million in goodwill 

selfinsurance programs 

we selfinsure a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program we purchase certain stoploss insurance to limit our liability exposure we also selfinsure a portion of our property and casualty risk which includes automobile liability general liability workers’ compensation and property coverage under deductible insurance programs the insurance premium costs are expensed over the contract periods 

we record an accrual for the claims expense related to our employee medical benefits automobile liability general liability and workers’ compensation claims based upon the expected amount of all such claims if actual claims are higher than what we anticipated our accrual might be insufficient to cover our claims costs and we would increase our claims expense in that period to cover the shortfall 

contingencies 

we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business resulting from litigation claims and other commitments and from a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies we accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we determine the amount of reserves if any with the assistance of outside legal counsel we 

  

regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether the accruals should be adjusted if the amount of an actual loss were greater than the amount we have accrued the excess loss would have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period that the loss occurred if the loss contingency is subsequently determined to no longer be probable the amount of loss contingency previously accrued would be included in our operating results in the period such determination was made we do not expect the resolution of loss contingencies to have a material effect on our financial statements 

accounting for income taxes 

all income tax amounts reflect the use of the liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions with different tax rates and we determine the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based upon various estimates and assumptions 

we record a provision for taxes based upon our effective income tax rate we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we expect is more likely than not to be realized we consider historical taxable income expectations and risks associated with our estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we had a valuation allowance of 26 million and 15 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively against our deferred tax assets should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment of 26 million to the net deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made conversely should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made 

we recognize the benefits of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns in the provision for income taxes only for those positions that are more likely than not to be realized we recognize interest and penalties accrued relating to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax expense in the normal course of business we will undergo tax audits by various tax jurisdictions such audits often require an extended period of time to complete and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits changes in accruals for uncertainties arising from the resolution of preacquisition contingencies and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances of acquired businesses after the measurement period will be recorded in earnings in the period the changes are determined adjustments to other tax accruals we make are generally recognized in the period they are determined 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for all stockbased payments including employee stock options at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all awards on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award 

several key factors and assumptions affect the valuation models currently utilized for valuing our stock option awards we have been in existence since february 1998 and have been a public company since october 2003 we have elected to use the blackscholes valuation model we use the simplified method in developing an estimate of expected life of stock options because we lack sufficient data to calculate an expected life based on historical experience our first annual option grant with a full five year vesting period since we became a public 

  

company was on january 13 2006 and these awards became fully vested in january 2011 additionally our options have a ten year life while our existence as a public company has been only seven years therefore we will continue to use the simplified method until we have the historical data necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of expected life we estimate volatility which is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of the option based on the historical volatility of our stock our forfeiture assumption is based on voluntary and involuntary termination behavior as well as historical forfeiture rates we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimates if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the dividend yield represents the dividend rate expected to be paid over the option’s expected term and we currently have no plans to pay dividends the riskfree interest rate is based on us treasury zerocoupon issues available at the time each option is granted that have a remaining life approximately equal to the option’s expected life key assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock options granted in 2010 were expected term of 64 years riskfree interest rate of 317 dividend yield of 0 forfeiture rate of 78 and volatility of 439 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

see “recent accounting pronouncements” in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information related to new accounting standards 

segment reporting 

approximately 95 of our operations are conducted in the us we have aftermarket and recycled product operations in canada which were expanded in 2010 through the acquisition of cross canada an aftermarket product supplier we also have operations in guatemala and costa rica our mexican locations include a bumper refurbishing operation and a heavyduty truck location 

we are organized into three operating segments composed of wholesale aftermarket and recycled products self service retail products and recycled heavyduty truck products these segments are aggregated into one reportable segment because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services customers and methods of distribution 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth statements of income data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated 

 

   

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

revenue our revenue increased 206 to 25 billion for the year ended december 31 2010 from 20 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in revenue was primarily due to business acquisitions higher volume of products we sold and higher revenue from scrap metal and other metals sales our parts and services organic revenue growth rate was 66 which was comprised of 42 organic growth in our recycled products revenue and 82 organic growth in our aftermarket products revenue the higher growth in our aftermarket products organic revenue was driven by greater visibility to aftermarket products by our salvage sales force along with higher inventory levels and improved positioning within our distribution network which created a greater volume of parts available for sale and higher fulfillment rates other revenue had an organic growth rate of 522 primarily attributable to the effects of scrap metal and other metals prices that have increased over the prior year combined with higher sales volume we also had a 04 favorable impact on revenue derived from foreign exchange on our canadian operations 

cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased 229 from 11 billion in 2009 to 14 billion in 2010 as a percentage of revenue cost of goods sold increased from 547 to 557 the increase in our cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to higher salvage acquisition prices in 2010 combined with an increase in revenue from scrap aluminum which generated lower margins salvage acquisition prices in 2010 increased due to the expiration of the cash for clunkers program and higher overall demand for salvage vehicles at auction the increase in salvage costs and impact of higher relative revenue from scrap aluminum were partially offset by improved aftermarket margins due to price increases and lower costs on aftermarket products due to vendor competition additionally market conditions in our heavyduty truck operations began to improve which resulted in lower heavyduty truck inventory acquisition costs 

gross margin our gross margin increased 179 from 9278 million in 2009 to 10935 million in 2010 our gross margin increased primarily due to increased volume as a percentage of revenue gross margin decreased from 453 to 443 the decrease in our gross margin as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the factors noted above in cost of goods sold 

facility and warehouse expenses facility and warehouse expenses increased 164 from 2011 million in 2009 to 2340 million in 2010 our facility and warehouse expenses increased 329 million primarily due to incremental expenses of 177 million from business acquisitions principally the acquisition of greenleaf in october 2009 and the organic growth of our operations as a percentage of revenue facility and warehouse expenses decreased from 98 to 95 primarily due to higher revenue spread over fixed facility costs 

distribution expenses distribution expenses increased 169 from 1819 million in 2009 to 2127 million in 2010 our distribution expenses increased 308 million primarily due to incremental expenses of 105 million from business acquisitions 68 million of higher fuel costs 53 million of higher labor and laborrelated expenses and 97 million for increased variable expenses such as freight costs and truck rentals resulting from higher parts volume in 2010 partially offset by 17 million lower vehicle insurance and claims cost as a percentage of revenue our distribution expenses decreased from 89 to 86 primarily due to improved leverage of our distribution network including increased revenue from scrap metal and other metals that did not require additional distribution expense 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 121 from 2767 million in 2009 to 3102 million in 2010 our business acquisitions accounted for 116 million of the increase primarily in labor and labor related costs the remaining increase in our selling general and administrative expenses was due primarily to higher labor and labor related expenses of 197 million higher credit card and bank fees of 15 million and higher advertising and promotion expenses of 12 million offset by lower legal and claims costs of 32 million as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses decreased from 135 to 126 primarily due to improved leverage of selling and administrative employees in a period of growing revenue including revenue from scrap metal and other metals that did not require additional selling general and administrative expenditures 

  

restructuring expenses restructuring expenses decreased 738 to 07 million in 2010 from 26 million in 2009 the restructuring expenses in 2010 were the result of the greenleaf acquisition while 2009 restructuring expense was related to the integration of keystone automotive industries inc “keystone” into existing lkq operations we do not expect further restructuring expenses related to the greenleaf and keystone acquisitions see note 10 “restructuring and integration costs” to the audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a further discussion of restructuring and integration activities related to our acquisitions 

depreciation and amortization  depreciation and amortization including that reported in cost of goods sold above increased 107 from 374 million in 2009 to 414 million in 2010 business acquisitions accounted for 22 million of the increase in depreciation and amortization expense while increased levels of property and equipment accounted for the remaining increase as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization decreased from 17 in 2009 to 15 in 2010 

operating income  operating income increased 287 from 2314 million in 2009 to 2979 million in 2010 as a percentage of revenue operating income increased from 113 to 121 the increase in operating income as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to improved leveraging of operating expenses over a larger revenue base partially offset by lower gross margins in 2010 due to higher salvage acquisitions costs and higher relative revenue from scrap aluminum as noted in cost of goods sold above 

other income expense total other expense net increased 62 from 261 million in 2009 to 278 million in 2010 the increase in other expense net is primarily due to the absence of a 43 million gain on bargain purchase that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to the greenleaf acquisition partially offset by lower net interest expense our average bank borrowings were approximately 433 million lower in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to voluntary prepayments of our scheduled 2010 repayments combined with our scheduled repayments in addition our average effective interest rate on our bank borrowings was 486 in 2010 compared to 495 in 2009 see note 9 “business combinations” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a further discussion of the acquisition of greenleaf and the related gain on bargain purchase 

provision for income taxes  the provision for income taxes increased 318 from 782 million in 2009 to 1030 million in 2010 our effective income tax rate was 381 in both 2010 and 2009 our effective state tax rate decreased by 07 in 2010 as a result of a shift in income to lower rate jurisdictions the effective rate remained flat compared to the prior year because of the absence of the rate benefit generated from the nontaxable gain on bargain purchase in 2009 the provision for income taxes in both periods was affected by discrete items in 2009 we recognized a 43 million nontaxable gain on bargain purchase related to the greenleaf acquisition which lowered the 2009 effective income tax rate by 08 the 2010 effective tax rate included adjustments related to the revaluation of deferred taxes in connection with a legal entity reorganization in the first quarter 05 decrease to rate the reversal of reserves upon the closing of statutes of limitations 05 decrease to rate and the establishment of valuation allowances on state tax credit carryforwards 02 increase to rate in 2009 we also benefitted from reserve reversals upon the closing of statutes of limitations which lowered the effective income tax rate by 05 

income from discontinued operations net of taxes our discontinued operations net of taxes generated 20 million of income in 2010 compared to 04 million in 2009 income from discontinued operations increased primarily due to the gain of 27 million 17 million net of tax from the sale of two self service retail facilities to ssi on january 15 2010 

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

revenue our revenue increased 73 to 20 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 from 19 billion for the comparable period of 2008 the increase in revenue was primarily due to the higher volume 

  

of products we sold and business acquisitions partially offset by lower service revenue due to lower volumes of crush only vehicles while our total organic revenue increased 19 in 2009 our organic revenue growth rate for parts and services was 70 during the year 

cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased 52 from 10647 million in 2008 to 11201 million in 2009 the increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to increased volume of products sold as a percentage of revenue cost of goods sold decreased from 558 to 547 reductions in the cost of vehicles for our self service operations contributed to the decline in the cost of goods sold percentage compared to the prior year the ferrous and nonferrous metals markets for scrap declined significantly in the latter part of 2008 and our margins at the self service facilities suffered as we were forced to sell at lower prices than anticipated when we had acquired the product we adjusted our purchasing to take into account the lower sales pricing for vehicles in our self service retail operations and our margins improved over the course of 2009 our cost of goods sold percentage also decreased due to favorable acquisition prices for our wholesale aftermarket operations in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of lower steel prices 

gross margin our gross margin increased 100 from 8438 million in 2008 to 9278 million in 2009 our gross margin increased primarily due to increased volume as a percentage of revenue gross margin increased from 442 to 453 our gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased due primarily to the factors noted above in cost of goods sold 

facility and warehouse expenses facility and warehouse expenses increased 104 from 1821 million in 2008 to 2011 million in 2009 our facility and warehouse expenses increased primarily due to 168 million from business acquisitions and 47 million in higher wages and fringe benefits resulting from increased headcount for field personnel along with higher incentive compensation partially offset by 12 million of lower insurance expense and claims costs and 06 million of lower fuel costs as a percentage of revenue facility and warehouse expenses increased from 95 to 98 due primarily to our acquisition of pyp in the third quarter of 2008 facility and warehouse expenses are typically higher as a percentage of revenue in our self service operations 

distribution expenses distribution expenses increased 13 from 1796 million in 2008 to 1819 million in 2009 our distribution expenses increased primarily due to 66 million from business acquisitions 25 million of higher wages and benefits from an increase in the number of employees and higher incentive compensation higher third party freight of 15 million and higher truck rentals and repairs of 08 million partially offset by lower fuel costs of 106 million as a percentage of revenue our distribution expenses decreased from 94 to 89 primarily due to lower fuel costs on a higher revenue base and delivery route consolidations 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 107 from 2500 million in 2008 to 2767 million in 2009 our business acquisitions accounted for 131 million of the increase primarily in labor and labor related costs our selling expenses tend to rise as revenue increases due to our commissioned sales forces our remaining selling general and administrative expenses increased due primarily to higher labor and labor related expenses of 83 million higher professional fees of 54 million higher telephone and data line expenses of 13 million higher credit card discount and bank fees of 10 million and higher repairs and maintenance expenses of 13 million partially offset by lower bad debt expense of 19 million and lower advertising and promotion expenses of 23 million as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses increased from 131 to 135 primarily due to higher incentive compensation and professional fees 

restructuring expenses restructuring expenses decreased 703 to 26 million in 2009 from 86 million in 2008 the restructuring expenses relate primarily to the integration of keystone into preexisting lkq operations 

  

depreciation and amortization  depreciation and amortization including that reported in cost of goods sold above increased 137 from 329 million in 2008 to 374 million in 2009 business acquisitions accounted for 17 million of the increase in depreciation and amortization expense increased levels of property and equipment accounted for the remaining increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization increased from 16 in 2008 to 17 in 2009 

operating income  operating income increased 197 from 1933 million in 2008 to 2314 million in 2009 as a percentage of revenue operating income increased from 101 to 113 the increase in operating income in dollars and as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to improved gross margins lower fuel costs and lower restructuring expenses 

other income expense total other expense net decreased 235 from 341 million in 2008 to 261 million in 2009 the decrease in other expense net is due primarily to lower net interest expense and a gain on the bargain purchase of greenleaf net interest expense decreased 130 to 309 million in 2009 from 355 million in 2008 our average bank borrowings were approximately 113 million lower in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to scheduled repayments and voluntary prepayments of a portion of 2010 scheduled repayments in addition our average effective interest rate on our bank borrowings was 495 in 2009 compared to 574 in 2008 we realized a gain of 43 million on the bargain purchase of greenleaf in 2009 see note 9 “business combinations” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a further discussion of the acquisition of greenleaf 

provision for income taxes  the provision for income taxes increased 260 from 620 million in 2008 to 782 million in 2009 our effective income tax rate was 390 in 2008 and 381 in 2009 we recorded a 43 million nontaxable gain on bargain purchase related to the greenleaf acquisition which had the effect of lowering the 2009 effective income tax rate by 08 our effective state tax rate increased by 05 in 2009 as a result of state tax law changes and a shift in income to higher rate jurisdictions the effective tax rate for 2009 decreased by 04 compared to 2008 related to unrecognized tax benefits as a result of higher reserve reversals upon the closing of statutes of limitations and a reduced provision for current year unrecognized tax benefits 

income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations decreased 863 from 28 million in 2008 to 04 million in 2009 the decrease was primarily due to 37 million 23 million net of tax in restructuring expenses related to the closing of two self service facilities and an impairment charge of 35 million 22 million net of tax related primarily to leasehold improvements at these closed facilities additionally the discontinued operations reported lower earnings as revenue from scrap metal and other metal sales declined in 2009 primarily as a result of lower commodity prices the year over year decrease was partially offset by a 39 million gain 25 million net of tax on the sale of certain self service facilities in the fourth quarter of 2009 

2011 outlook 

we estimate that full year 2011 income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the impact of any restructuring expenses will be in the range of 194 million to 208 million and 131 to 139 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of ongoing liquidity are cash flows from our operations and our credit facility which expires on october 12 2013 at december 31 2010 we had 957 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately 732 million available under our bank credit agreement 100 million commitment less outstanding letters of credit of 268 million see note 5 “longterm obligations” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information on our credit facilities 

  

since we entered into the credit facility in october 2007 our average availability under the revolving facilities excluding letters of credit has been approximately 746 million the highest amounts outstanding under our revolving facilities and in the form of letters of credit were 89 million and 268 million respectively we have not utilized the revolving facilities as a primary source of liquidity but we do maintain sufficient availability if needs arise 

borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at variable rates which depend on the type us dollar or canadian dollar and duration of the borrowing plus an applicable margin rate the weightedaverage interest rate on borrowings outstanding against our senior secured credit facility at december 31 2010 after giving effect to the interest rate swap contracts in force described in note 6 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k was 397 borrowings against the senior secured credit facility totaled 5901 million and 5957 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively of which 500 million and 75 million were classified as current maturities respectively 

in 2010 we entered into two floating to fixed interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of 350 million these swaps establish fixed interest rates of 156 plus applicable margin currently at 225 for 250 million of our variable rate debt through october 2015 and 109 plus applicable margin currently at 225 for 100 million of our variable rate debt between april 2011 and october 2013 we have elected to extend our 250 million notional swap beyond the maturity date of our current credit facility because of the ability to lock a low fixed rate over a five year period and our expectation that we will carry at least 250 million in variable rate debt from the maturity date of our current credit facility through the october 2015 swap expiration 

on april 16 2010 moody’s investors service “moody’s” raised its ratings on us and on borrowings under our outstanding credit facility to ba2 from ba3 on april 26 2010 standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” raised its corporate credit rating on us to bb from bb and raised its ratings on borrowings under our outstanding credit facility to bbb from bb both moody’s and sp issued their ratings upgrades with a stable outlook 

our liquidity needs are primarily to fund working capital requirements and expand our facilities and network the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds we normally pay for aftermarket parts purchases at the time of shipment or on standard payment terms depending on the manufacturer and payment options offered our purchases of aftermarket parts and wheels totaled approximately 5767 million 5366 million and 4904 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under some direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles wheel cores acquired from third parties are normally paid for on standard payment terms we acquired approximately 198000 166500 and 144500 wholesale salvage vehicles in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our 2009 purchases included approximately 20500 vehicles purchased under the cash for clunkers program in addition we acquired approximately 297000 287000 and 253000 lower cost self service and crush only vehicles in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we also purchased 38800 and 44000 lower cost self service and crush only vehicles for our discontinued operations in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 1592 million in 2010 compared to 1640 million in 2009 in 2010 our operating income excluding depreciation and amortization increased by 698 million relative to the same period in 2009 which was offset by a higher investment in our primary working capital accounts receivables inventory and accounts payable and higher tax payments of 390 million in 2010 compared to 2009 the net cash outflow for our primary working capital accounts increased from 389 million in 2009 to 699 million in 2010 primarily due to higher inventory purchases our 2010 aftermarket purchases increased due to our expansion of certain product lines and an increase of onhand inventory to meet demand for certain products in 2010 we also purchased a greater volume of wholesale salvage vehicles at higher average prices than 2009 increased sales volume in our recycled and related products and services product category drove increased volume of wholesale salvage vehicle purchases in 2010 as inventory levels were built up to meet 

  

demand our 2009 salvage purchase costs also included 20500 lowerpriced cash for clunkers vehicles we expect average car costs to remain at current levels as demand for salvage vehicles at auction remains high 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1916 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 1025 million for 2009 in 2010 we invested 1436 million of cash in acquisitions in 2009 we invested 683 million including 388 million for the greenleaf acquisition in october and received net proceeds of 31 million on settlements of purchase price receivables and payables related to earlier acquisitions in 2010 and 2009 we completed the sale of certain of our self service yards resulting in cash inflow net of cash sold of 120 million and 175 million respectively property and equipment purchases were 614 million in 2010 which is 56 million higher than the capital expenditures in 2009 

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 190 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 332 million net cash used by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2009 the variance is primarily attributable to debt repayments in 2009 we made our regularly scheduled term loan payments of 149 million and also elected to prepay the first three quarters’ term loan payments for 2010 totaling 224 million as a result of the prepayment in 2009 we had only one quarterly payment required in 2010 for 75 million in 2010 we had no activity on our line of credit borrowings whereas in 2009 we repaid 2009 and earlier line of credit borrowings resulting in a net cash outflow of 67 million repayments of other debt which primarily consists of notes issued for business acquisitions were 21 million for 2010 compared to 17 million in the prior year cash generated from exercises of stock options provided 140 million and 82 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively the excess tax benefit from stockbased payment arrangements reduced income taxes payable by 150 million and 96 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 1640 million in 2009 compared to 1330 million for the same period of 2008 net income adjusted for noncash gains and losses depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation generated 1745 million of cash in 2009 a 333 million increase over the same period of 2008 inventory net of effects of purchase acquisitions represented a cash outflow of 204 million in 2009 we increased our purchases of aftermarket inventory during the first half of 2009 to increase our safety stock for new customer programs and to expand certain product categories to additional locations while we previously expected aftermarket inventory levels to decrease in the second half of 2009 we altered our buying to increase our depth of inventory in response to rising customer demand which caused inventory balances to continue to grow we believe that our purchasing strategy contributed to the increase in aftermarket sales compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 cash receipts from customers increased as a result of improved collections as our receivables net of effects of purchase acquisitions were flat while sales increased by 7 over the prior year our cash outflows related to restructuring activities have declined in 2009 relative to 2008 in 2009 we made payments of 41 million for restructuring costs compared to 166 million in 2008 as the bulk of our keystone integration costs were incurred in 2008 cash paid for income taxes net of refunds was 493 million in 2009 compared to 392 million in 2008 the increase is primarily attributable to higher pretax income in 2009 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1025 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 1389 million for 2008 we invested 683 million of cash in acquisitions in 2009 including 388 million for the greenleaf acquisition in october and received a net 31 million on settlements of purchase price receivables and payables related to 2008 acquisitions in 2008 we spent 742 million for eight acquisitions in october 2009 we completed the sale of certain of our self service yards for 175 million net of cash sold property and equipment purchases were 559 million in 2009 which is 110 million below the capital expenditures for the comparable period in the prior year the reduction in capital expenditures is attributable to fewer facility expansion projects in 2009 lower capital spending related to the keystone integration effort in 2009 and lower capitalizable costs for internal use software development projects 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 332 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 118 million for 2008 the variance is primarily attributable to debt repayments beginning in the first quarter of 2009 our scheduled term loan payments increased to approximately 

  

49 million per quarter in 2009 compared to 25 million per quarter in the prior year in addition during the fourth quarter of 2009 we elected to prepay 224 million of our term loan payments scheduled for 2010 we repaid our line of credit borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2009 resulting in a net cash outflow for 2009 of 67 million compared to a cash inflow of 53 million in 2008 which inflow resulted from borrowings to fund a canadian business acquisition repayments of other debt which primarily consists of notes issued for business acquisitions were 17 million for 2009 compared to 63 million in the prior year cash generated from exercises of stock options provided 82 million and 104 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the excess tax benefit from sharebased payment arrangements reduced income taxes payable by 96 million and 125 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

as part of the consideration for business acquisitions completed during 2010 2009 and 2008 we issued promissory notes totaling approximately 55 million 12 million and 16 million respectively the notes bear interest at annual rates of 20 to 40 and interest is payable at maturity or in monthly installments 

we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of redistribution centers processing facilities and warehouses through further integration of aftermarket refurbished and recycled product facilities and through selected business acquisitions our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions our amendment to our credit agreement effective november 19 2010 increases our flexibility to use cash for acquisitions and to deploy debt proceeds among other things which we expect will support our strategy to supplement our organic growth with acquisitions 

we believe that our current cash and equivalents cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements however we may from time to time raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements there can be no assurance that additional funding or refinancing of our credit facility if needed will be available on terms attractive to us or at all furthermore any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

2011 outlook 

we estimate that our capital expenditures for 2011 excluding business acquisitions will be between 85 million and 95 million we expect to use these funds for several major facility expansions improvement of current facilities real estate acquisitions and systems development projects maintenance or replacement capital expenditures are expected to be slightly less than 25 of the total for 2011 we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities for 2011 will be approximately 195 million 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements and future commitments 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to item 303 of regulation sk under the securities exchange act of 1934 additionally we do not have any synthetic leases

deferred compensation payments are dependent on elected payment dates while we expect that these payments will be made more than five years from the latest balance sheet date payments may be made earlier depending on such elections our deferred compensation plans are funded through investments in life insurance policies refer to note 11 “retirement plans” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information related to the deferred compensation plans and related investments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facility where interest rates are tied to either the prime rate or libor in march 2008 we implemented a policy to manage our exposure to variable interest rates on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt instruments through the use of interest rate swap contracts these contracts convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt matching effective and maturity dates to specific debt instruments all of our interest rate swap contracts have been executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy jp morgan chasebank na and deutsche bank ag and are denominated in currency that matches the underlying debt instrument net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swap contracts will be included as adjustments to interest expense in our consolidated income statement as of december 31 2010 we held two interest rate swap contracts representing a total of 450 million of notional amount with maturity dates in october 2015 250 million and april 2011 200 million additionally as of december 31 2010 we held an interest rate swap 

  

contract on a notional amount of 100 million effective in april 2011 this contract will replace a portion of the 200 million contract upon expiration in april 2011 and expires in october 2013 all of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and modify the variable rate nature of that portion of our variable rate debt as of december 31 2010 the fair market value of the 200 million notional amount swap was a liability of 14 million while the fair market value of the other swap contracts was an asset of 48 million the value of such contracts is subject to changes in interest rates 

at december 31 2010 we had unhedged variable rate debt of 1401 million which will increase by 100 million in april 2011 when the 100 million notional amount swap replaces the 200 million notional amount swap currently in effect using sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of a 100 basis point movement in the interest rate interest expense would change by 21 million after giving effect to the hedge expiration over the next twelve months to the extent that we have cash investments earning interest a portion of interest expense increase resulting from the variable rate change would be mitigated by higher interest income 

we are also exposed to market risk related to price fluctuations in scrap metal and other metals market prices of these metals affect the amount that we pay for our inventory as well as the revenue that we generate from sales of these metals as both our revenue and costs are affected by the price fluctuations we have a natural hedge against the changes however there is typically a lag between the metal price fluctuations which influences our revenue and any inventory cost changes therefore we can experience positive or negative margin effects in periods of rising or falling metal prices particularly when such prices move rapidly in 2010 scrap metal and other metals prices increased to near alltime highs contributing to our increased revenue if market prices were to fall at a greater rate than our salvage acquisition costs similar to our experience in the fourth quarter of 2008 we could experience a decline in gross margin rate 

additionally we are exposed to currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket products in taiwan while all transactions with manufacturers based in taiwan are conducted in us dollars changes in the relationship between the us dollar and the taiwan dollar might impact the purchase price of aftermarket products we might not be able to pass on any price increases to customers under our present policies we do not attempt to hedge this currency exchange rate exposure 

we do not attempt to hedge our foreign currency risk related to our operations in central america and canada under our present policies we maintain a canadian dollar term loan that had a balance of cdn 363 million as of december 31 2010 we have not elected to hedge the foreign currency risk related to this term loan as we generate canadian dollar cash flows that can be used to fund debt payments

 item 1 business tableend overview 

lkq corporation “lkq” or the “company” provides replacement systems components and parts needed to repair vehicles cars and trucks in the case of automobile and light truck repairs there are three part types that may be classified as alternatives to new original equipment manufacturers’ “oems” collision replacement parts these include 1 aftermarket products —new products produced by manufacturers other than the oems 2 recycled products —parts produced by or for oems and removed from salvage vehicles and 3 refurbished products —remanufactured and repaired vehicle parts originally produced by or for oems 

we are the nation’s largest provider of alternatives to oem collision products and a large provider of mechanical replacement parts used by collision and mechanical automobile repair businesses we distribute aftermarket collision replacement parts recycled collision and mechanical parts and refurbished collision replacement products such as wheels bumper covers and lights to collision automobile repair businesses in addition to our full service wholesale recycling operations we operate self service facilities that sell retail recycled automotive products we also sell recycled heavyduty truck parts and used heavyduty trucks we segment our business into three operating divisions—wholesale automobile parts self service retail parts and heavyduty truck parts 

lkq was established in 1998 to create a network of wholesale recycled auto products businesses serving the automobile collision repair industry by 2003 we had become the largest provider of recycled products and related services in the us with a network of locations that served a majority of the larger markets in the us in 2004 we expanded into new business lines and began selling refurbished and aftermarket products that same year we entered the self service retail auto parts business with the acquisition of a number of self service operations with the acquisition in october 2007 of keystone automotive industries inc “keystone” we became the nation’s leading distributor of recycled and aftermarket collision replacement products and began refurbishing bumpers and bumper covers in conjunction with the acquisition of keystone we rebranded all of our aftermarket product business under the name “keystone” 

we entered the heavyduty truck parts recycling industry in 2008 the heavyduty truck parts recycling industry has operating and sales functions that are similar to the auto recycled parts business 

we obtain the majority of our aftermarket parts inventory from auto parts manufacturers and distributors based in the us and taiwan the recycled auto products that we sell are obtained for the most part by procuring salvage vehicles typically severely damaged by collisions and primarily sold at salvage auctions or pools and then dismantling and inventorying the parts the refurbished products including wheels bumpers bumper covers and head and tail lamps that we sell are created from damaged parts bought through bulk purchases from core sales companies that collect damaged parts parts received in trade at collision shops purchasing replacement products from us and parts from the salvage vehicles bought at auctions 

  

the majority of our products and services are sold to collision repair shops also known as body shops and mechanical repair shops we indirectly rely on insurance companies which ultimately pay for the majority of collision repairs of insured vehicles insurance companies tend to exert significant influence in the vehicle repair decision because of their importance to the process we have formed business relationships with certain insurance companies in order to be a preferred parts supplier 

we provide customers with a value proposition that includes high quality products at lower cost than new oem products extensive product availability due to our regional inventory trading zones and responsive service and quick delivery repair shops and insurance companies benefit because the lower costs for our products enable many vehicles to be repaired rather than declared total losses the breadth of our product offerings—aftermarket products recycled products and refurbished wheels bumpers bumper covers and head and tail lamps—allows us to serve as a “onestop” solution for our customers looking for the most cost effective way to provide quality repairs 

we strive to be environmentally responsible our recycled automotive products provide an alternative to the manufacture of new products which would require the expenditure of significantly more resources and energy and would generate a substantial amount of additional pollution in addition we save landfill space because the parts that we recycle would otherwise be discarded we also collect materials such as fuel and motor oil from the salvage vehicles that we procure and use them in our operations or sell them to other users 

history 

since our formation in 1998 we have grown through acquisitions and internal development today lkq is the only source for aftermarket and recycled automobile collision parts with a national network and presence 

initially formed through the combination of a number of wholesale recycled auto parts businesses located in florida michigan ohio and wisconsin lkq grew to be a leading source for recycled auto collision and mechanical parts in february 2004 we expanded our product offerings by acquiring a supplier of aftermarket and refurbished products and an operator of self service recycled facilities offering retail recycled products we entered the production of refurbished wheels with our acquisition of an aluminum alloy wheel refurbishing business in january 2006 and refurbished head and tail lamps with our acquisition of this type of business in january 2007 in october 2007 we significantly increased our size by acquiring keystone at the time of the acquisition keystone was the leading distributor of aftermarket collision replacement parts keystone also refurbished steel bumpers plastic bumper covers and alloy wheels which added to our existing wheel business the keystone acquisition also expanded our product offerings to include paint and other materials used in the repair of damaged vehicles 

in march 2008 we entered a new industry which we believe is complementary to our existing businesses with the acquisition of a recycled heavyduty truck parts business since that date we have made additional strategic acquisitions of wholesale auto parts businesses recycled heavyduty truck parts businesses and self service retail vehicle products facilities we made the following acquisitions in 2009 

 

   

our largest acquisition in 2009 was greenleaf auto recyclers llc “greenleaf” a wholesale auto parts recycling business previously owned by schnitzer steel industries inc we believe that at the time of the transaction greenleaf was the second largest wholesale auto parts recycling business in the us with 17 locations operating in nine states concurrent with the greenleaf acquisition we sold four self service facilities and certain assets associated with three other self service locations to schnitzer in january 2010 we sold two additional self service recycling facilities to schnitzer 

strategy 

we are focused on creating economic value for our stockholders by enhancing our position as a leading source for alternative collision and mechanical repair parts and by expanding into other product lines and businesses that may benefit from our operating strengths such as recycled heavyduty truck parts we believe a supply network with a broad inventory of quality alternative collision repair parts high fulfillment rates and superior customer service will provide us with a competitive advantage the competition in the markets in which we serve is extremely fragmented and the supply of parts tends to be localized often leading to low fulfillment rates particularly with recycled products the recycled and aftermarket distribution channels have historically been distinct and separate despite serving the same customer segment to execute our strategy we are expanding our network of dismantling plants and parts warehouses in major metropolitan areas and employing a distribution system that allows for order fulfillment from regional warehouses located across the us by continuing to grow our recycled parts inventory complemented by a broad supply of aftermarket parts and efficiently moving the inventory within our network we have increased fulfillment rates beyond the levels that we believe most of our competitors realize particularly for recycled parts 

sources of high quality reliable alternatives to oem parts are important to insurance companies and to our direct customers as they seek to control repair costs lower parts costs and quicker completion of orders saves money and reduces cycle times we believe this strategy is relevant for both the automobile and heavyduty truck markets in order to execute this strategy and build on our progress thus far we seek to expand into new additional markets and to improve penetration both organically and through acquisitions in targeted markets 

national network in place 

lkq has invested significant capital to develop a national network of aftermarket recycled and refurbished product facilities the difficulty and time required to obtain proper zoning as well as dismantling and other environmental permits necessary to operate newlysited recycled parts facilities would make establishing a new network of locations a challenge for a competitor in addition there are difficulties associated with recruiting and hiring an experienced management team that has strong industry knowledge and local relationships with customers 

we believe there are growth opportunities in new primary and secondary markets in the us and canada we intend to expand our market coverage through a combination of internal development and acquisitions in new regions and adjacent markets our national network allows us to initially enter new adjacent markets by establishing local redistribution facilities avoiding the need for significant upfront capital outlays to establish local dismantling capabilities and inventories we maintain a disciplined approach to acquisitions in new markets or expansions in existing market areas 

strong business relationships 

we have developed business relationships with automobile insurance companies collision repair shops and other industry participants we believe that insurance companies as payers for many repairs are increasingly taking more active roles in the selection of alternative replacement products for vehicle repairs in order to contain the repair portion of the claims costs on behalf of certain insurance companies we provide a review of vehicle repair estimates so they may assess the opportunity to increase usage of recycled aftermarket and refurbished 

  

products in the repair process thereby reducing their costs our employees also provide quotes for our products to assist several insurance companies with their estimate and settlement processes we also work with insurance companies and vehicle manufacturers to procure salvage vehicles directly from them on a selected basis which provides us with an additional source of supply and offers lower transaction costs to sellers of low value salvage vehicles we believe we are positioned to take advantage of the increasing importance these industry participants have in the repair process and will continue to look for ways to enhance our relationships with them 

we have begun to provide parts programs that offer additional product support to auto insurance companies these product support programs identify specific subsets of aftermarket parts by vendor and product type that can be used in the repair of vehicles that they insure the programs typically offer aftermarket products that have been produced by manufacturers certified by a third party testing lab we may provide additional validation of the quality of the parts beyond our standard warranties and identification details that make the parts traceable back to a manufacturer’s specific production run 

to strengthen our relationship with collision shops we have developed “keyless” a program that enables collision repair shops to link their estimating systems with our aftermarket and recycled inventory it is compatible with all of the major estimating systems and provides up to the minute inventory availability the system encourages the use of alternative parts by indicating to the collision shop the availability of applicable alternative parts at the time of the estimate it also provides data to our purchasing department as to the demand of specific parts and offers sales leads for our sales representatives 

technology driven business processes 

we continue to focus on technology development as a way to support our competitive advantage we believe that we can more cost effectively leverage our data to make better decisions than our smaller competitors we continue to develop our technology to better manage and analyze our inventory assist our salespeople with uptodate pricing and availability of our products and further enhance our inventory procurement process for example our representatives responsible for procuring vehicles are equipped with handheld computing devices that compare the vehicles at the salvage auctions to our current inventory historical demand and recent average prices to arrive at an estimated maximum bid this bidding system reduces the likelihood of purchasing unneeded parts that might result in obsolete inventory 

we deploy inventory management systems at our facilities that are similar to those used by leading distribution companies we make extensive use of bar code technology and wireless data transmission to track parts from the time a vehicle or part arrives at a facility to its placement on a route truck for delivery to the customer all of our aftermarket locations run on a standard operating platform in our wholesale recycled products business we are in the process of migrating to lkq x  a proprietary system that provides enhanced data for management reporting and analysis and simplifies the sales process of both recycled and aftermarket products for our sales representatives through december 31 2009 we had installed lkq x in five of our eight regions we anticipate the rollout will be completed by yearend 2010 

demand driven procurement 

we use information systems and proprietary methodologies to help us identify high demand aftermarket and recycled products our information systems prioritize and recommend bid prices of the salvage vehicles we evaluate to purchase for our inventory we believe efficient procurement of aftermarket products and salvage vehicles is critical to the growth of the operating results and cash flow of our business our processes and systems help to identify with a high degree of accuracy the value of the parts that can be recycled on a salvage vehicle sold at auction and recommend a maximum purchase price to achieve our target margins from the resale of the recycled products we also use historical sales records of vehicles by model and year to estimate the demand for our products combining this information with proprietary data that aggregates actual customer requests for products we are able to source aftermarket products and salvage vehicles at prices that we believe will allow us to sell products profitably 

  

our aftermarket inventory system tracks parts sold and sales lost due to a lack of inventory and makes purchase recommendations the inventory system also recommends purchases and transfers based on the extent and location of demand our buying team reviews the recommendations and places orders accordingly when we procure aftermarket products and refurbish wheels bumpers and lights we focus on products that are in the most demand by the insured repair market our most popular aftermarket products are head lamps tail lamps grilles hoods mirrors bumpers bumper covers and fenders because lead times may take 45 or more days on imported parts sales volume and instock inventory are important factors in the procurement process 

high fulfillment rates 

we have increased local inventory levels and found that it has improved our customer service and allowed for faster deliveries for both our aftermarket and recycled parts sales operations improving order fulfillment rates reduces transfer costs and delivery times and improves customer satisfaction our ability to share inventory on a regional basis increases the availability of replacement products and also helps us to fill a higher percentage of our customers’ requests we have developed regional trading zones within which we make our inventory available to our local facilities mostly via overnight product transfers we manage our recycled product inventory and purchasing on a regional basis to enhance the availability of the products that we believe will be in the highest demand within each region our higher than industry average fulfillment rates are a key differentiator compared to our competition 

broad product offering 

the breadth and depth of our inventory reinforces lkq’s ability to provide a “onestop” solution for our customers’ aftermarket recycled and refurbished product needs customers place a high value on the availability of a broad range of vehicle replacement products we are able to provide the collision repair industry with premium parts at costs typically 20 to 50 below new oem replacement parts the availability of alternative parts means that automobiles can be repaired at lower costs than if only new oem parts are used and leads to more cars repaired rather than designated as ‘total losses’ by insurance companies in fact many insurance companies will not authorize the use of higher cost new oem replacement parts if alternative parts are available our ability to supply these parts gives insurance companies the confidence to designate lkq as the preferred supplier for their repair shops with our national footprint and comprehensive repair parts programs in nearly all of the major us markets we believe we are the only supplier that is able to support the insurance industry in this manner our aftermarket product offering is particularly broad with more than 62000 skus in order to address the multiple needs of our aftermarket customers we offer our platinum plus line of high quality parts with lifetime warranties our value line of aftermarket products for vehicle repairs when cost is the main factor and parts certified by independent organizations such as the certified automotive parts association “capa” we offer other products including paint and related repair materials like tape sandpaper paint guns and frame racks so that our customers can purchase these at the same time as they are ordering their parts 

one call away 

to execute our strategy of offering a broad inventory with high fulfillment rates we offer our customers the choice of aftermarket recycled or refurbished parts if for example a customer has a damaged hood we may offer that customer a choice of a recycled or a new aftermarket hood because recycled parts are in limited supply our ability to offer new aftermarket alternative parts increases our fulfillment rates and customer satisfaction historically there have been separate supply channels in the industry for recycled and aftermarket parts however our business is evolving to where in some markets we are combining the channels through the sharing of warehousing inventory sales and distribution systems so that our repair shop customers need only one source of supply for their collision repair parts 

  

wholesale auto parts 

our wholesale auto parts operations are comprised of aftermarket recycled and refurbished parts distribution operations we have eight geographic regions serving the united states and parts of canada that sell all three product types to collision and mechanical automobile repair businesses 

our aftermarket and refurbished auto parts businesses are conducted from facilities that serve as sales warehousing and distribution centers as of december 31 2009 we conducted our aftermarket and refurbished parts distribution from 145 facilities in the united states and canada 

we process salvage vehicles and warehouse recycled parts at facilities throughout the united states and canada a typical facility has processing sales distribution and administrative operations on site indoor and outdoor storage areas and includes a large warehouse with multiple bays to dismantle vehicles we also have facilities that operate primarily as redistribution centers as of december 31 2009 we conducted our wholesale recycled parts operations from 92 facilities 74 of which include a combination of processing sales and redistribution operations and 18 of which are primarily redistribution facilities 

we refurbish bumpers and wheels at 51 locations in the united states and canada and one location in northeast mexico we refurbish head lamps and tail lamps primarily at a facility in michigan 

wholesale aftermarket products 

we distribute more than 62000 skus of aftermarket collision parts and repair materials for the most common models of domestic and foreign automobiles and light trucks generally for the eight most recent model years our principal aftermarket product types consist of those most frequently damaged in collisions including automotive body parts bumpers grilles and lights we also sell cooling products paint and other materials used by collision repair shops the sources for our aftermarket products are both foreign and domestic manufacturers and distributors 

automotive body parts 

aftermarket products provide the collision repair industry with quality products at prices well below new oem replacement parts lower costs may help insurers contain collision repair costs and often mean that cars are considered repairable rather than categorized as total losses 

the major collision product categories we have available for sale include body panels cooling system products bumper covers grilles and replacement lighting components and mirrors we carry multiple product lines that target different customer needs 

platinum plus 

platinum plus is an exclusive brand offered in the keystone product line of aftermarket parts it offers high quality parts at lower costs than new oem replacement parts the platinum plus parts are held to high quality standards and tested by quality teams we provide a warranty for as long as a consumer owns the vehicle many of our platinum plus parts are used for repairs that are ultimately paid for by insurance companies or may be part of our quality assurance programs 

capa 

capa is an association that evaluates the functional equivalence of aftermarket collision replacement products to oem collision replacement products members of capa include insurance companies parts distributors including lkq collision repair shops and consumers 

  

capa develops engineering specifications for aftermarket collision replacement products based upon an examination of oem parts certifies the factories manufacturing processes and quality control procedures used by independent manufacturers and certifies the materials fit and finish of specific aftermarket collision replacement products many major insurance companies have adopted policies recommending or requiring the use when available of the approximately 3000 parts certified by capa a number of capa certified parts are also marketed under the platinum plus brand 

we distribute parts certified by capa and actively participate with capa insurance companies and consumer groups in encouraging independent manufacturers of collision replacement products to seek capa certification 

value line 

we have developed a product line called “value line” for more value conscious often selfpay consumers our value line products offer quality parts at reasonable prices providing additional choices for repairs or rebuilding of vehicles the value line product line is available for most product categories 

paint and related materials 

we distribute paint and other materials used in repairing damaged vehicles including sandpaper abrasives masking products and plastic filler the paint and other materials distributed by us are purchased from numerous domestic suppliers certain of these products are distributed under the brand “keystone” 

suppliers 

the aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from independent manufacturers located primarily in taiwan and the us in 2009 we purchased 15 of the aftermarket products we sell from one manufacturer and 12 from another manufacturer no other suppliers provided more than 6 we believe we are one of the largest customers of each of the ten largest suppliers we purchased approximately 42 of our aftermarket products directly from manufacturers in taiwan and other asian countries approximately 58 of our aftermarket products were purchased from locations in the united states however we believe that the majority of these products were manufactured in taiwan and other asian countries 

we benefit from an automated procurement system that makes order and inventory transfer recommendations using actual part sales and data for lost sales due to stockouts buyers review the system’s recommendations and then place purchase orders or arrange for a redistribution of inventory to areas of higher demand for new parts we use vehicle volume and registrations by state to influence what new products should be ordered and where the stock should be located typically six months after the parts are introduced the automated system has sufficient data to make order recommendations 

we have business arrangements with manufacturers to produce our platinum plus products these agreements automatically renew for additional 12 month periods unless written notice is given while we compete with other distributors for production capacity we believe that our sources of supply and our relationships with our suppliers are satisfactory 

for orders from domestic suppliers we usually receive part orders within ten days orders placed with foreign manufacturers generally are received within 45 to 60 days 

foreign orders typically are shipped in sea containers directly to 75 of our 145 locations we have 23 regional hubs and one master warehouse located in michigan the hub warehouses act as sources for our other noncontainer direct aftermarket warehouse locations and serve as the central stocking point of all slower moving items which allows all branches to have a high fillrate of next day availability this structure enables us to provide higher fulfillment rates with minimal inventory on hand 

  

wholesale recycled products 

wholesale recycled collision and mechanical parts provide high quality lowerprice repair options our most popular recycled products include engines transmissions doors front end assemblies trunk lids bumper assemblies head and tail lamp assemblies and mirrors some insurance companies mandate that the recycled parts must be of the same model year or newer as the vehicle being repaired as a result the parts we sell are typically from vehicles not more than ten years of age we have adopted the industry’s grading system based on the condition of the parts and factor part grades into our pricing decisions unlike aftermarket parts that are individually boxed recycled parts are most frequently sold as subassemblies or as multiple parts already put together installing recycled parts often means that collision shops not only save on parts cost but are able to reduce labor costs 

procurement of inventory 

each year approximately 1012 million of the more than 240 million vehicles registered in the united states become end of life vehicles “elv” and are retired from use for reasons including age damage malfunction or abandonment we procure recycled products for our wholesale operations by acquiring severely damaged or totaled vehicles vehicles that have been declared “total losses” typically are sold at regional salvage auctions held throughout the country approximately 3 million salvage vehicles were sold in 2009 at the salvage auctions we attended primarily to automotive recyclers exporters and rebuilders salvage auctions charge fees both to the suppliers of vehicles primarily insurance companies and to the purchasers such as lkq additionally we pay third parties fees to tow the vehicles from the auction to our facilities 

over the past few years the frequency with which vehicles are declared total losses has increased as a result¸ we believe of the rise in repair costs relative to used car values as oems offer models that have increasingly complex safety measures such as multiple airbags and vehicle operating sensors the cost to repair such vehicles has risen 

in 2009 lkq acquired approximately 166500 salvage vehicles for our wholesale recycled operations with approximately 97 purchased at salvage auctions 

our salvage buyers typically visit the auction sites in advance of scheduled auction dates to investigate the vehicles to be sold and determine our interest in buying them they obtain key information such as the model and mileage and perform visual damage assessments to determine which parts on the targeted vehicles are recyclable with the data from this preview we deploy a bidding system that performs a valuation calculation for each vehicle the calculation incorporates demand for a vehicle’s recyclable parts current inventory levels average selling prices auction costs projected margins and instances of outofstock and recommends a maximum bid price bids are then placed on those vehicles which contain desirable parts the system provides a disciplined supply and demand procurement approach that focuses on vehicles for which there is greatest demand in general we focus on vehicles that are typically no more than ten years old 

we acquired approximately 3 of the salvage vehicles we purchased for wholesale parts in 2009 directly from insurance companies vehicle manufacturers and other direct sellers these arrangements eliminate the fees charged to the buyers and sellers by the salvage auction often providing inventory with a lower initial expenditure of capital direct purchase agreements while usually beneficial have limited applicability to our overall fleet procurement because of the volume of vehicles we buy purchasing vehicles at auction provides us with the flexibility to focus on sought after vehicles based on our bidding algorithms 

when we obtain mechanical components wheels bumpers and certain lighting products from dismantled vehicles for which there is excess supply or if the parts are defective we bundle these items and sell them as “cores” cores are either sold in bulk to remanufacturers as is the case for mechanical parts or sent to our own refurbishing locations as is the case for wheel bumper and lighting items mechanical cores including engine blocks transmissions starters alternators and air conditioner compressors are transferred to our processing facility in houston texas where we sort them by product and model type and sell them in bulk 

  

vehicle processing 

vehicle processing for our wholesale operations involves dismantling a salvage vehicle into recycled products that are ready for sale when a salvage vehicle arrives at one of our facilities an inventory specialist identifies catalogs and schedules the vehicle for dismantling prior to dismantling each vehicle is run through a process to remove its fluids freon and parts containing hazardous substances and precious metals such as catalytic converters the extracted fluids are stored in bulk and subsequently sold to recyclers in the case of gasoline the fuel retrieved is primarily used to power our delivery vehicles a small portion of the recycled motor oil we collect is used at certain of our plants that have highefficiency oil burning furnaces the balance is sold to motor oil recyclers 

when ready for dismantling each vehicle will have an inventory report that indicates to the dismantler which parts should be removed and placed in a warehouse for future sales to customers which parts should be collected in bulk for sale to parts remanufacturers and which parts have value but for now should remain on the vehicle 

products that are placed directly on our shelves are typically higher sales volume items such as engines transmissions doors hoods trunk lids head and tail lamp assemblies and front and rear bumpers many of the recycled parts we sell are subassemblies of multiple parts including quarter panels and front end assemblies the subassemblies are cut from the vehicle bodies usually using specific parameters provided by the repair shop at the time of sale 

products that are not in a condition to be sold as recycled products or that are in surplus supply are separated and sold in bulk to parts remanufacturers or in the case of wheel bumper and lighting items are sent to our refurbishing facilities 

if there is strong demand for parts that are currently at high stock levels in our warehouses we may choose to hold the vehicle for further dismantling at some future date when we are more likely to have a need for the parts the holding period for partially dismantled car bodies will depend on the rack space available at the site once all of the parts of value have been removed the remaining vehicle frame is crushed and sold to scrap processors 

prior to placement on our warehouse shelves each inventory item is given a unique bar code tag for identification and entered into our inventory tracking system we utilize bar coding systems and wireless transmission to keep track of inventory from the time a part is removed and inventoried to the time it is sold and put on a truck for delivery 

refurbished products 

our purchase of keystone included its bumper and wheel refurbishing operations as of december 31 2009 we operated 38 plastic bumper and bumper cover refurbishing plants two chrome bumper plating plants 12 wheel plants and one light refurbishing plant 

much of the output of our refurbishing plants is sold through our aftermarket and wholesale recycled parts operations the balance is sold to retail tire and wheel stores wholesale distributors and via internet sales 

the majority of our refurbished products are processed from cores obtained from salvage vehicles purchased by our recycled operations damaged cores collected by our route delivery drivers from vehicles under repair by our customers and from core brokers our sales capacity is limited by the availability of cores to refurbish we also sell some remanufactured or refurbished mechanical parts such as engines and transmissions that we acquire from mechanical remanufacturers 

  

scrap and other materials 

our wholesale recycling operations generate scrap metal and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that have been dismantled for recycled parts and “crush only” elvs acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site in other cases we will hire mobile crushing equipment to crush the vehicles before they are transported to shredders and scrap metal processors 

customers 

we have a well established wholesale customer list that includes collision and mechanical repair shops and new and used car dealerships no single customer accounted for 2 or more of our revenue in 2009 

repair shops and others 

we sell the majority of our products to collision and mechanical repair shops industry reports estimate there were approximately 44200 collision repair shops including those owned by new car dealerships in the united states in 2008 the same reports estimate there were approximately 76700 general including mechanical repair garages but excluding new car dealership service departments in the united states in 2008 the majority of these customers tend to be individuallyowned small businesses although there has been a trend toward consolidation resulting in the formation of several national and regional repair companies we also sell our products to automobile dealerships and fleet management groups 

insurance companies 

automobile insurance companies wield significant influence on the demand for our products while insurance companies do not pay for our products directly they ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount as a result insurance companies often influence the types of products used in a repair 

our nationwide presence gives us a unique ability to service the major automobile insurance companies insurance companies generally operate at a national or regional level and play a critical role in the repair process the use of our products provides a direct benefit to these companies by lowering the cost of repairs decreasing the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and providing a replacement product that is of high quality and comparable performance to the part replaced 

we assist insurance companies by providing high quality aftermarket and recycled parts to collision repair shops especially to repair shops that are part of an insurance company’s direct repair program “drp” network our keyless system indicates on estimates the availability of alternative parts as replacements for damaged oem parts and whether we have those parts in inventory this data helps insurance companies monitor the body shops’ compliance with its drp parts guidelines that might for instance stipulate the use of the lowest cost products that meet the quality specifications in addition in some markets insurance companies are able to dispose of low value total loss vehicles directly to us so they can save the transaction fees associated with selling these vehicles through salvage auctions 

remanufacturers—core sales 

a mechanical part that is unsuitable for sale as a replacement part or is a part for which we currently have an excess supply will typically be sold in bulk shipments to mechanical remanufacturers examples of mechanical parts we sell in this manner are engine blocks and heads transmissions starters alternators and air conditioner compressors our sales to remanufacturers tend to be large orders and are dependent on their needs for certain product lines 

  

sales and marketing 

in the case of repairs paid for as a result of insurance claims which industry publications estimate is approximately 85 of all repairs collision repair shops are given directives as to what type of replacement parts are eligible for reimbursement insurance companies determine the replacement parts that are eligible for reimbursement for repairs of vehicles underwritten by specific insurance carriers typically insurance carriers have established a hierarchy or decision tree prioritizing the types of products to be used for repairs first use recycled parts if available if not seek aftermarket or refurbished parts as alternatives if none of these alternative parts types are available the shop may then use new oem replacement parts as a body shop looks for parts for a repair the sourcing of parts typically begins with a call to one of our recycled operations or one of our competitors our recycled sales personnel are encouraged to capture the sale as a “onestop shop” and to fill orders from our aftermarket or refurbished parts inventory if recycled parts are out of stock to support these efforts we have provided access to both recycled and aftermarket sales systems for the recycled sales staff and developed sales incentive programs that encourage cross selling throughout our wholesale operations we have also created links for aftermarket sales staff to refer customers to our recycled products sales staff 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 1550 fulltime sales staff in our aftermarket and wholesale recycled products operations the full time sales personnel are located at sales desks at our facilities or at one of the regional call centers we operate we deploy a call routing system that redirects overflow calls to alternative call centers typically located within the same region we also operate two other call centers one to support national accounts and the other to support insurance adjusters’ needs and questions our sales personnel are encouraged to initiate outbound calls in addition to the inbound calls they handle our sales staff can use our keyless estimating system to generate sales leads for both aftermarket and recycled parts 

we are continually reviewing and revising the pricing of our aftermarket and recycled products our pricing specialists consider factors such as recent demand levels inventory quantity on hand and turnover rates new oem product prices and local competitive pricing with the goal of optimizing revenue we set list prices and then sell items at a discount to list with the discount typically based on volume we may adjust prices during the year in response to material price changes of new oem replacement products 

we believe our commitment to stock inventory in local warehouses supplemented by the inventory sharing system within our regional trading zones improves our ability to meet our customers’ requirements more frequently than our competitors and gives us a competitive advantage 

distribution 

we have a nationwide distribution network of 237 aftermarket warehouses and wholesale recycled plants of which 33 function as large hub or cross dock facilities our network of facilities allows us to develop and maintain our relationships with local repair shops while providing a level of service that is made possible by our nationwide presence our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries as required by our customers using drivers who routinely deliver to the same customers our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network 

we have developed an internal distribution network to allow our sales representatives to sell aftermarket recycled and refurbished products from inventory within regional trading zones thus improving our ability to fulfill customer requests and accelerating inventory turnover each weekday we operate approximately 250 transfer runs between our cross dock facilities and our plants and warehouses generally within our eight trading zones to redistribute aftermarket recycled and refurbished products for delivery on the next day in addition we have approximately 2400 local delivery routes serving our customers each weekday 

each sale results in the generation of a work order at the location housing the specific part a dispatcher is then responsible for ensuring fulfillment accuracy printing the final invoice and including the product on the 

  

appropriate truck route for delivery to the customer in markets where we offer aftermarket recycled and refurbished products we have begun to integrate the delivery of multiple product types on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs and improve customer service we operate a delivery fleet of mediumsized trucks and smaller trucks and vans over time our delivery vehicles will become more consistent as we reconfigure the fleet to include vehicles that can carry both aftermarket and recycled parts 

competition 

we consider all suppliers of vehicle collision products to be competitors including other recycled businesses oems parts remanufacturers suppliers of aftermarket and refurbished products and internetbased suppliers we believe our focus on collision parts differentiates us from many of these competitors we do not consider retail chains that focus on the sales of aftermarket mechanical replacement parts to be our direct competitors we believe the principal areas of differentiation in our industry include availability of inventory pricing product quality and service 

we compete with more than 6000 domestic vehicle product recyclers most of which are singleunit operators we believe most of the vehicle parts recyclers in the us have less than 30 million in annual revenue in some markets smaller competitors have organized affiliations to share marketing and distribution resources including internet sites we also compete with distributors of aftermarket and refurbished collision products similar to the recycled parts industry the aftermarket collision parts distribution business is highly fragmented and our competitors other than oems are generally independently owned distributors with one to three distribution centers 

manufacturers of new original equipment parts sell the majority of automobile replacement products we believe however that as the insurance and repair industries come to appreciate the advantages of aftermarket recycled and refurbished products the alternatives to new oem replacement parts will account for a larger percentage of total vehicle replacement product sales 

we compete with oems on the basis of service price and product quality and compete with distributors of aftermarket collision parts primarily on the basis of service the recycled and refurbished nationwide distribution system our platinum plus product line our relationships with certain insurance companies and to a lesser extent price 

self service retail 

our self service retail operations sell parts from older cars and trucks directly to consumers in addition to revenue from the sale of parts core and scrap we charge a small admission fee to access the property our self service facilities typically consist of a fenced or enclosed area of several acres with vehicles stored outdoors and a retail building through which customers are able to access the yard as of december 31 2009 we conducted our self service retail operations from 34 facilities in north america 

inventory 

we acquire inventory for our self service retail products operations from a variety of sources including but not limited to towing companies auctions municipality sales insurance carriers charitable organizations and the general public we typically procure salvage vehicles that are more than eight model years old for our self service retail recycled products operations these vehicles will typically be older and of lower quality than the salvage vehicles we purchase for our wholesale recycled parts operations in 2009 we purchased approximately 325800 lower cost self service and crush only vehicles 

  

processing and placement 

vehicles are typically delivered to our locations by the seller though in some cases we will arrange for transportation once on our property minimal labor is required to process the vehicle other than removing the fluids and hazardous materials vehicles are then put out in the yard for customers to remove parts the vehicle inventory is usually organized according to domestic and foreign cars passenger vans and trucks in our self service business availability of a specific part will depend on which vehicles are currently at the site and to what extent parts may have previously been removed and sold 

part prices are listed on regularly updated price sheets and will vary by part type but not by make or model for instance four cylinder engines are priced the same amount regardless of vehicle make model age or condition the revenue sources from these operations are the sale of parts the entrance fees and the sale of the cores and the scrap of the crushed car bodies of the vehicle after the sale parts have been removed vehicles usually remain available to customers for 30 to 60 days before they are crushed and sold to scrap metal processors 

scrap and other materials 

our self service auto recycling operations generate scrap metal and other materials that we sell to recyclers vehicles that are no longer available to the public and “crush only” vehicles acquired from other companies including oems are typically crushed using equipment on site to process the remaining car bodies 

competition 

there are competitors operating self service businesses in all of the markets in which we operate in some markets there are numerous competitors often operating in close proximity to our operations we try to differentiate our business by the quality of the inventory and the size and cleanliness of the lot 

customers 

the customers of our self service yards are frequently doityourself mechanics small independent repair shops servicing older vehicles or auto rebuilders selling low end cars 

heavyduty trucks 

lkq started its heavyduty recycled truck parts operations in 2008 with the purchase of a recycler based in houston texas as of december 31 2009 we had a total of seven facilities located in california florida illinois maryland ohio and texas in the us and quebec in canada we began our recycled truck operations with a belief that development of a network would offer similar opportunities to those we have experienced with our wholesale recycled auto parts operations 

our inventory is comprised of used heavy and mediumduty trucks usually from 2003 or earlier which are purchased at salvage and truck auctions or directly from insurance companies or large fleet operators during 2009 we purchased 3730 vehicles depending on the condition of the vehicles they may be resold as running vehicles or dismantled for parts the vehicles that are acquired for resale are typically special purpose or vocational use trucks such as those used for garbage pickup or cement delivery if requested by the sellers of the vehicles we provide an assurance that the vehicles will be sold to foreign buyers and exported to countries for use outside of the us or to domestic buyers after the vehicles have been reconditioned and modified for use other than their original purpose 

customers 

customers for the recycled parts are often owneroperators local cartage companies operating small fleets or foreign buyers seeking low cost parts most commonly engines and transmissions newer parts will often be sold to insurance companies for use in an insured’s vehicle we also sell parts and running vehicles to exporters 

  

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 10000 employees we are a party to a collective bargaining agreement with a union that represents approximately 30 employees at our totowa new jersey facility approximately 350 of our employees at our bumper refurbishing plant in mexico and approximately 160 of our employees at our recycled parts facility in quebec city canada are also represented by unions other than these locations none of our employees is a member of a union or participates in other collective bargaining arrangements 

facilities 

our corporate headquarters are located at 120 north lasalle street suite 3300 chicago illinois 60602 the lease for our corporate headquarters expires in july 2011 we also have regional offices throughout the united states all of which perform corporate functions the primary functions performed at our corporate offices are financial accounting treasury marketing business development human resources information systems support and legal in addition to our corporate offices we have numerous operating facilities that handle recycled aftermarket refurbished self service retail and heavyduty truck products we operate out of approximately 294 physical locations in total a majority of these locations are leased some of our locations stock multiple product types or serve more than one function 

included in our total locations are five recycled parts facilities in central america we have a core processing facility in texas and an aluminum smelter in indiana 

information technology 

we are in the process of installing a proprietary facility management system called “lkq x ”  that we developed for our wholesale recycled operations to replace a third party system we expect to have fully converted our wholesale recycled operations to lkq x by the end of 2010 the new system improves the integration of inventory with the aftermarket system and provides improved control selling and data analysis features we believe that a single system that presents a combined view of recycled and aftermarket products helps facilitate the sales process allows for continued implementation of standard operating procedures and yields improved training efficiency employee transferability access to our national inventory database management reporting and data storage it also eliminates the need to create multiple versions of proprietary applications and systems support processes the system also supports an electronic exchange process for identifying and locating parts at other select recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock 

we use a single third party facility management system in our aftermarket operations additional third party software packages have been implemented to leverage the centralized data and information that a single system provides such as a data warehouse to conduct enhanced analytics and reporting an integrated budgeting system an electronic data interchange tool and ecommerce tools to enhance our online businesstobusiness initiatives—orderkeystonecom and keyless 

the hardware that supports our wholesale recycled facility and aftermarket management systems is located in offsite data centers the centers are in secure environments with aroundtheclock monitoring redundant power backup and multiple diverse data and telecommunication routing 

we use a single facility management system in most of our refurbishing operations we have been evaluating options to standardize the facility management systems relating to our heavyduty truck and self service operations a system has been chosen for the heavyduty truck operations and is being installed at each of those locations the truck system migration should be completed during 2010 

we use separate third party provided software for our financial systems such as financial and budget reporting general ledger accounting accounts payable payroll and fixed assets we currently protect our local 

  

customer inventory and corporate consolidated data such as financial information email files and other user files with daily backups these backups are stored off site with a third party data protection vendor 

we continually evaluate our systems with the goal of ensuring that all critical systems remain scalable and operational as our business grows 

regulation 

environmental compliance 

our operations and properties including the maintenance of our delivery vehicles are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations these environmental laws govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials 

we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters we have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements we cannot assure you however that we will at all times be in complete compliance with such requirements 

although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot assure you that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

contamination resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release storage transportation or disposal of gasoline motor oil antifreeze transmission fluid cfcs from air conditioners other hazardous materials or metals such as aluminum cadmium chromium lead and mercury contamination from the refurbishment of chrome plated bumpers can occur from the release of the plating material contamination can migrate onsite or offsite which can increase the risk and the amount of any potential liability 

in addition many of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use that may have involved hazardous materials as a result some of our properties may be contaminated some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination even if these owners or operators did not know of and were not responsible for such contamination these environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of treats or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties or successors to such owners or operators for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 

when we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process we analyze the risks and when appropriate perform further environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination furthermore where appropriate we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters in addition at times we or sellers from whom we purchased a business have undertaken remediation projects we do not anticipate based on currently available information and current laws that we will incur liabilities in excess of reserves to address environmental matters however in the event we discover new information or if laws change we may incur significant liabilities which may exceed our reserves 

  

title laws 

in some states when a vehicle is deemed a total loss a salvage title is issued whether states issue salvage titles is important to the supply of inventory for the vehicle recycling industry because an increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles currently these titling issues are a matter of state law in 1992 the us congress commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle titling registration and salvage since then legislation has been introduced seeking to establish national uniform requirements in this area including a uniform definition of a salvage vehicle the vehicle recycling industry will generally favor a uniform definition since it will avoid inconsistencies across state lines and will generally favor a definition that expands the number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage however certain interest groups including repair shops and some insurance associations may oppose this type of legislation national legislation has not yet been enacted in this area and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in the future 

anticar theft act 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any “covered major part” the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on vehicle recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may further discourage the use by such shops of recycled products 

legislation affecting automotive repair parts 

most states have laws that establish requirements for the use of aftermarket parts in motor vehicle collision repair work these requirements range from consumer disclosure to the vehicle owner regarding the use of aftermarket parts in the repair process to the requirement to have aftermarket parts certified by an independent testing organization some jurisdictions have laws that regulate the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags additional laws of this kind may be enacted in the future an increase in the number of states passing such legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on our business additionally congress could enact federal legislation restricting the use of aftermarket and recycled automotive parts used in the course of collision repair 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather related accidents in addition the cost of salvage vehicles tends to be lower as weather related accidents generate a larger supply of total loss vehicles 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend risks relating to our business 

our operating results and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the economic conditions in the united states 

the declining economic conditions in the us have adversely impacted our business such conditions have resulted in fewer miles driven fewer accident claims and a reduction of vehicle repairs in the event that the us economic conditions do not improve or continue to decline we expect that our business will continue to be negatively affected 

  

we face intense competition from local national and internetbased vehicle products providers and this competition could negatively affect our business 

the vehicle replacement products industry is highly competitive and is served by numerous suppliers of oem products recycled products aftermarket products and refurbished products within each of these categories of suppliers there are local owneroperated companies larger regional suppliers national providers and internetbased suppliers providers of vehicle replacement products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of vehicle replacement products which may further increase competition some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise greater financial technical manufacturing distribution and other resources longer operating histories lower cost structures and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries than we do in certain regions of the us local vehicle recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in the wholesale recycled products industry as a result of these factors our competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply provide their products at lower costs or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve 

we believe that substantially in excess of 50 of collision parts by dollar amount are supplied by oems with the balance being supplied by distributors like us the oems are therefore in a position to exert pricing pressure in the marketplace we compete with the oems primarily on price and to a lesser extent on service and perceived quality from time to time oems have experimented with reducing prices on specific products to match the lower prices of alternative products if such price reductions were to become widespread it could have a material adverse impact on our business 

claims by oems relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business 

oems have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims the oems have brought such claims in federal court and with the united states international trade commission since our acquisition of keystone automotive industries inc in october 2007 the distribution of aftermarket products constitutes a significantly larger percentage of our business 

in december 2005 and may 2008 ford global technologies llc filed complaints with the international trade commission against us and others alleging that certain aftermarket parts imported into the us infringed on ford design patents the parties settled these matters in april 2009 pursuant to a settlement arrangement that expires in september 2011 

united states patent and trademark office records indicate that oems are seeking and obtaining more design patents then they have in the past to the extent that the oems are successful with intellectual property infringement claims we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business we will likely incur significant expenses investigating and defending intellectual property infringement claims in addition an unexpected result of the intellectual property infringement litigation is that the certified automotive parts association “capa” is decertifying parts that are the subject of the claims lack of capa certification may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of aftermarket parts only if they have been certified by capa 

an adverse change in our relationships with auction companies or our suppliers could increase our expenses and hurt our ability to serve our customers 

most of our salvage inventory is obtained from vehicles offered at salvage auctions operated by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the us we do not typically have contracts with any auction company according to industry analysts a small number of companies control a large percentage of the salvage auction market in the us if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its 

  

auctions began competing with us or significantly raised its fees our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers moreover we are facing increased competition in the purchase of salvage vehicles from direct competitors rebuilders exporters and others this increase in the number of bidders may increase our cost of goods sold for wholesale recycled products most states regulate bidders to help ensure that salvage vehicles are purchased for legal purposes auction companies have been actively seeking to reduce or eliminate these regulations which if successful would further increase the number of bidders 

we also acquire inventory directly from insurance companies oems and others to the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue these arrangements our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers 

we are dependent on a relatively small number of suppliers of aftermarket products most of which are located in taiwan although alternative suppliers exist for substantially all aftermarket products distributed by us the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on us until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced providing products moreover our operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad including among other things transportation delays political instability currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs import and export controls and other nontariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas as well as the uncertainty regarding future relations between china and taiwan because a substantial volume of our sales involves parts manufactured from sheet metal we can be adversely impacted if sheet metal becomes unavailable or is only available at higher prices which we may not be able to pass on to our customers 

if our business relationships with insurance companies end we may lose important sales opportunities 

we rely on business relationships with several insurance companies these insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide the business relationships include in some cases participation in aftermarket quality and service assurance programs that may result in a higher usage of our aftermarket parts than would be the case without the programs our arrangements with these companies may be terminated by them at any time including in connection with their own business concerns relating to the offering availability standards or operations of the aftermarket quality and service assurance program we rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in an illinois lawsuit involving state farm mutual automobile insurance company  “avery v state farm”  a jury decided in october 1999 that state farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using nonoem replacement parts to repair damaged vehicles when use of such parts did not restore the vehicle to its “preloss condition” the jury found that state farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of nonoem replacement parts and the alleged inferiority of those parts the jury assessed damages against state farm of 456 million and the judge assessed an additional 730 million of disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the illinois consumer fraud act in april 2001 the illinois appellate court upheld the verdict but reduced the damage award by 130 million because of duplicative damage awards on august 18 2005 the illinois supreme court reversed the awards made by the circuit court and found among other things that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any breach of contract by state farm the us supreme court declined to hear an appeal of this case as a result of this case some insurance companies reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket products our financial results could be adversely affected if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled products from us due to a fear of similar claims 

we may not be able to sell our products due to existing or new laws and regulations prohibiting or restricting the sale of wholesale aftermarket recycled or refurbished products 

some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled products that we provide such as airbags these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or 

  

severely restrict the sale of additional recycled products restrictions on the products we are able to sell could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

most states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair work andor require enhanced disclosure or vehicle owner consent before using aftermarket products in such repair work additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future if additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business 

certain organizations test the quality and safety of vehicle replacement products in the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product such events could adversely affect our business 

we may not be able to successfully acquire new businesses or integrate acquisitions which could cause our business to suffer 

we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms or for other reasons if we buy a company or a division of a company we may experience difficulty integrating that company’s or division’s personnel and operations which could negatively affect our operating results in addition 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 financing the keystone acquisition substantially increased our leverage and places restrictions on our business 

in connection with the acquisition of keystone we entered into a senior secured debt financing facility with a group of lenders our total outstanding indebtedness including bank financing letters of credit and notes payable in connection with acquisitions as of december 31 2009 was 6289 million the increase in our indebtedness may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to fund capital expenditure or working capital needs because we will require additional funds to service our indebtedness 

in addition the senior secured credit agreement contains operating and financial restrictions and requires that we satisfy certain financial and other covenants the failure to comply with any of these covenants would 

  

cause a default under the credit agreement a default if not waived could result in acceleration of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing credit facility or it may be on terms that are not acceptable to us 

our future capital needs may require that we seek debt financing or additional equity funding that if not available could cause our business to suffer 

we may need to raise additional funds in the future to among other things fund our existing operations improve or expand our operations respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions from time to time we may raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic alliances or other arrangements however the ongoing turmoil in the credit markets has resulted in tighter credit conditions which could affect our ability to raise additional funds if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and further limitations on our operations if we fail to raise capital when needed our business may be negatively affected 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control future factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to those listed in the special note on forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k accordingly our results of operations may not be indicative of future performance these fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which could cause our stock price or the value of debt instruments to decline 

fluctuations in the prices of metals or shipping costs could adversely affect our financial results 

all of our recycle operations generate scrap metal and other metals that we sell after we dismantle a salvage vehicle for wholesale parts and after vehicles have been used in our self service retail business the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors and other remaining metals are sold to processors and brokers of metals in addition we receive “crush only” vehicles from other companies including oems which we dismantle and which generate scrap metal and other metals the prices of scrap and other metals have historically fluctuated sometimes significantly due to market factors in addition buyers may stop purchasing metals entirely due to excess supply to the extent the prices of metals decrease materially or buyers stop purchasing metals our revenue from such sales will suffer and a writedown of our inventory value could be required the cost of our wholesale recycled and our self service retail inventory purchases may also decrease as a result of falling scrap metal and other metals prices there can be no assurance that our inventory purchasing cost will decrease the same amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal and other metals prices decline and there may be a delay between the scrap metal and other metals price reductions and any inventory cost reductions the price of steel is a component of the cost to manufacture parts for our aftermarket business we incur substantial freight costs to import parts from our suppliers many of whom are located in asia if the cost of steel or freight rose we might not be able to pass the cost increases on to our customers 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur significant charges to our pretax income 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations in the future goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of acquisitions goodwill is 

  

reviewed at least annually for impairment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including modifications that restrict the activities of the acquired business as of december 31 2009 our total goodwill subject to future impairment testing was 9388 million for further discussion of our annual impairment test see “goodwill impairment” in the critical accounting estimates section of item 7 in this annual report on form 10k 

if the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines our business could suffer 

because our business depends on vehicle accidents for both the supply of wholesale recycled products and the demand for repairs using our products factors which influence the number andor severity of accidents including but not limited to the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven the ages of drivers the use of cellular telephones and other electronic equipment by drivers the congestion of traffic the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers and the condition of roadways impact our business in this regard a number of states and municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones while driving and such restrictions could lead to a decline in accidents to the extent oems develop new accident avoidance systems the number and severity of accidents could decrease moreover an increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road to decline and the number of miles driven to decline as motorists seek alternative transportation options and this also could lead to a decline in accidents 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits 

our operating subsidiaries must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations when we develop or acquire a new facility we must seek the approval of state and local units of government governmental agencies may resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling or refurbishing facility in their communities there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold 

if we lose our key management personnel we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives if we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel which could harm our business 

we rely on information technology in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business 

some of the information technology systems we use for management of our facilities and our financial functions are leased from or operated by other companies in the event that the providers of these systems terminate their relationships with us or if we suffer prolonged outages we could suffer disruptions to our operations 

in addition we continually monitor these systems to find areas for improvement in the event that we decided to switch providers or to implement our own systems we may also suffer disruptions to our business we may be unsuccessful in the development of our own systems and we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing our own systems also our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system which period could extend longer than we anticipated 

  

if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks our business could be harmed 

we use a fleet of trucks to deliver the majority of the products we sell we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in the transportation infrastructure availability and price of fuel liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance and insurance premium increases in addition our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials 

we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials 

under certain environmental laws we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at or migration to or from our or our predecessors’ past or present facilities and at independent waste disposal sites these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or was not responsible for the release of such hazardous substances 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we could be subject to product liability claims 

if customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage we could be subject to product liability claims by such customers the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business or financial condition in addition we have agreed to defend and indemnify in certain circumstances insurance companies that could be named as defendants in such lawsuits further such a claim if substantiated could impact our future revenue negatively 

regulations that may be issued under the anticar theft act could harm our business 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any “covered major part” the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on automotive parts recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may further discourage the use of recycled products by such shops 

  

risks relating to our common stock 

future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 

we and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock in the future we may also issue shares of common stock under our equity incentive plan or in connection with future acquisitions we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued in connection with an acquisition or the perception that such sales could occur may cause the price of our common stock to fall 

delaware law our charter documents and our loan documents may impede or discourage a takeover which could affect the price of our stock 

the antitakeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws our loan documents and delaware law could together or separately impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult the credit agreement we entered into in connection with our acquisition of keystone provides that a change of control is an event of default our incorporation under delaware law and these provisions could also impede an acquisition takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we provide replacement systems components and parts needed to repair vehicles cars and trucks buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily four sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers “oems” which are commonly known as oem products new products produced by companies other than the oems which are sometimes referred to as “aftermarket” products recycled products originally produced by oems which we refer to as recycled products and used products that have been refurbished we participate in the market for collision repair aftermarket products as well as the market for recycled products we obtain aftermarket products and salvage vehicles from a variety of sources and we dismantle the salvage vehicles to obtain a comprehensive range of vehicle products that we distribute into the vehicle repair market we also refurbish and sell bumpers wheels head lamps and tail lamps 

we are the largest nationwide provider of recycled products and related services with sales processing and distribution facilities that reach most major markets in the united states in october 2007 we acquired keystone automotive industries inc the nation’s leading distributor of aftermarket collision parts as a result we are the largest nationwide provider of aftermarket collision replacement products and refurbished bumper covers and wheels in addition to our full service wholesale recycling and aftermarket operations we operate self service facilities that sell retail recycled automotive products we also sell recycled heavyduty truck parts and used heavyduty trucks we believe there are opportunities for growth in our product lines through acquisitions and internal development 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to those listed in the special note on forwardlooking statements in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k due to these factors our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate accordingly our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance 

acquisitions 

since our inception in 1998 we have pursued a growth strategy of both organic growth and acquisitions we have pursued acquisitions that we believe will help drive profitability cash flow and stockholder value our principal focus for acquisitions is companies that will expand our geographic presence and our ability to provide a wider choice of alternative vehicle replacement products and services to our customers 

in 2009 we acquired eight businesses five in the wholesale business and three in the recycled heavyduty truck parts business the acquisitions enabled us to increase our geographic presence in the wholesale parts business and expand our network of recycled heavyduty truck parts facilities 

our 2009 acquisitions include greenleaf auto recyclers llc “greenleaf” which we purchased from schnitzer steel industries inc “ssi” in october at the time of the acquisition greenleaf operated wholesale recycling businesses from 17 locations we have begun to merge certain locations together with our existing wholesale recycling operations which will result in the elimination of approximately 11 operating locations this acquisition enabled us to increase our geographic presence and increase our capacity in numerous markets 

in august 2008 we acquired pickyourpart auto wrecking “pyp” an operator of multiple self service facilities in the state of california during 2008 we also acquired seven other businesses four in the wholesale business and three in the recycled heavyduty truck parts business these acquisitions included two businesses in canada the 2008 acquisitions enabled us to expand our presence in existing markets increase our geographic presence in the canadian market and become a provider of recycled heavyduty truck parts 

  

in october 2007 we acquired keystone the nation’s leading distributor of aftermarket collision parts for 8068 million net of cash acquired as a result we are now the largest nationwide provider of aftermarket collision replacement products and refurbished bumpers and wheels during 2007 we also acquired 11 other wholesale businesses these acquisitions included two businesses in canada these business acquisitions enabled us to expand our presence in existing markets serve new market areas and expand our product line offering 

divestitures 

in october 2009 we sold to ssi four retail oriented self service facilities in oregon and washington we also sold certain business assets to ssi related to two self service retail facilities in northern california and a self service retail facility in portland oregon we have closed the two self service retail facilities in northern california and converted the self service operation in portland to a wholesale recycling business we also agreed to sell to ssi two self service retail facilities in dallas texas and closed this portion of the transaction on january 15 2010 certain of these facilities qualified for treatment as discontinued operations the financial results and assets and liabilities of these facilities are segregated from our continuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income for all periods presented unless otherwise noted this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates only to financial results from continuing operations 

sources of revenue 

we report our revenue in three product categories i recycled products and related products and services ii aftermarket other new and refurbished products and iii other 

we generate the majority of our revenue from the sale of vehicle replacement products and related services which cover sales of i recycled products and related products and services and ii aftermarket other new and refurbished products in 2009 sales of vehicle replacement products and services represented approximately 90 of our consolidated sales recycled products which includes our wholesale recycled self service and heavyduty truck parts operations was our largest sales category prior to 2008 with the acquisition of keystone the percentage of our revenue derived from the sales of aftermarket other new and refurbished products now exceeds the recycled products category 

we sell the majority of our vehicle replacement products to collision repair shops and mechanical repair shops our vehicle replacement products include engines transmissions frontends doors trunk lids bumpers hoods fenders grilles valances wheels head lamps and tail lamps for an additional fee we sell extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products these contracts cover the cost of parts and labor and are sold for periods of six months one year two years or a nontransferable lifetime warranty we defer the revenue from such contracts and recognize it ratably over the term of the contracts or three years in the case of lifetime warranties the demand for our products and services is influenced by several factors including the number of vehicles in operation the number of miles being driven the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents availability and pricing of new parts seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions additionally automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process accordingly we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our products while they are not our direct customers we do provide insurance carriers services in an effort to promote the increased usage of alternative replacement products in the repair process such services include the review of vehicle repair order estimates direct quotation services to insurance company adjusters and an aftermarket parts quality and service assurance program we neither charge a fee to the insurance carriers for these services nor adjust our pricing of parts for our customers when we perform these services for insurance carriers 

there is no standard price for recycled aftermarket or refurbished products but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as product availability quality demand new oem replacement product prices the age of the vehicle being repaired and competitor pricing 

  

in 2009 revenue from other sources represented approximately 10 of our consolidated sales these other sources include scrap sales bulk sales to mechanical remanufacturers and sales of aluminum ingots and sows we derive scrap metal from several sources including oems and other entities that contract with us to dismantle and scrap certain vehicles which we refer to as “crush only” vehicles and from vehicles that have been used in both our wholesale and self service recycling operations revenue from other sources has grown in recent years due to higher scrap sales from our recycle and wheel operations including crush only vehicles and higher bulk sales of certain products to mechanical remanufacturers beginning in october 2008 and continuing into the third quarter of 2009 revenue from other sources declined relative to the same period in the prior year in total revenue from other sources decreased by 20 in 2009 compared to 2008 this trend is due to lower scrap metal and other metal prices and a reduction in the volume of crush only vehicles acquired revenue from other sources will fluctuate from period to period based on commodity prices and the volume of vehicles we sell for scrap 

when we obtain mechanical products from dismantled vehicles and determine they are damaged or when we have a surplus of a certain mechanical product type we sell them in bulk to mechanical remanufacturers the majority of these products are sorted by product type and model type examples of such products are engine blocks and heads transmissions starters alternators and air conditioner compressors

our cost of goods sold for recycled products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and where applicable auction storage and towing fees our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles since 2007 our labor and laborrelated costs related to acquisition and dismantling have accounted for approximately 8 of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle we are facing increasing competition in the purchase of salvage vehicles from shredders and scrap recyclers internetbased buyers and others the acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and as a result energy costs are not material 

our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts freight and other inventoried costs such as allocated overhead and import fees and duties where applicable our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors our cost of goods sold for refurbished wheels bumpers and lights includes the price we pay for inventory freight and costs to refurbish the parts including direct and indirect labor rent depreciation and other overhead related to refurbishing operations 

in the event we do not have a recycled product or suitable aftermarket product in our inventory to fill a customer order we attempt to purchase the part from a competitor we refer to these parts as brokered products since 2007 the revenue from brokered products that we sell to our customers has ranged from 2 to 5 of our total revenue the gross margin on brokered product sales as a percentage of revenue is generally less than half of what we achieve from sales of our own inventory because we must pay higher prices for these products 

some of our mechanical products are sold with a standard sixmonth warranty against defects we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claim information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses we also sell separately priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products the expense related to extended warranty claims is recognized when the claim is made 

expenses 

our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our distribution self service and warehouse facilities these costs include labor for plant management and facility and warehouse personnel stockbased compensation facility rent property and liability insurance utilities and other occupancy costs the costs included in facility and warehouse expenses do not relate to inventory processing or conversion activities and as such are classified below the gross margin line on our consolidated statements of income 

  

our distribution expenses primarily include our costs to deliver our products to our customers included in our distribution expense category are labor costs for drivers local delivery and transfer truck leases or rentals and subcontractor costs vehicle repairs and maintenance insurance and fuel 

our selling and marketing expenses primarily include our advertising promotion and marketing costs salary and commission expenses for sales personnel sales training telephone and other communication expenses and bad debt expense since 2007 personnel costs have accounted for approximately 80 of our selling and marketing expenses most of our product sales personnel are paid on a commission basis the number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our customers’ needs and increase our sales volume our objective is to continually evaluate our sales force develop and implement training programs and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness 

our general and administrative expenses primarily include the costs of our corporate and regional offices that provide corporate and field management treasury accounting legal payroll business development human resources and information systems functions these costs include wages and benefits for corporate regional and administrative personnel stockbased compensation long term incentive compensation accounting legal and other professional fees office supplies telephone and other communication costs insurance and rent 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather related accidents in addition the cost of salvage vehicles tends to be lower as more weather related accidents occur generating a larger supply of total loss vehicles 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition inventory valuation business combinations goodwill impairment selfinsurance programs contingencies accounting for income taxes and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue actual results may differ from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize and report revenue from the sale of vehicle replacement products when they are shipped and title has transferred subject to a reserve for returns discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information a replacement product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment our customers may earn discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment we analyze historical returns and allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates we use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold if actual returns and allowances are higher than our historical experience there would be an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence 

for an additional fee we also sell extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products revenue from these contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the contracts or three years in the case of lifetime warranties 

  

inventory accounting 

salvage inventory salvage inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle and includes buying dismantling and where applicable auction storage and towing fees inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facility’s inventory at expected selling prices the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility’s historical vehicle profitability for salvage vehicles purchased at auction or from contracted rates for salvage vehicles acquired under direct procurement arrangements 

aftermarket and refurbished product inventory aftermarket and refurbished product inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market our aftermarket inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for parts and includes expenses incurred for freight and buying where applicable and overhead for items purchased from foreign sources import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included our refurbished product inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for wheel bumper and lamp cores and includes expenses incurred for freight buying and refurbishing overhead 

for all inventory our carrying value is reduced regularly to reflect the age and current anticipated demand for our products if actual demand differs from our estimates additional reductions to our inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made 

business combinations 

for acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2009 we have applied the guidance in statement of financial accounting standards no 141 “business combinations” “sfas 141” for performing purchase price allocations effective on january 1 2009 we adopted accounting standards codification “asc” 805 “business combinations” “asc 805” formerly sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values the purchase price allocation is subject to change during the twelve month period subsequent to the acquisition date with the adjustments reflected prospectively for acquisitions under sfas 141 and retrospectively for those under asc 805 we utilize management estimates and an independent thirdparty valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and contingent consideration granted such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions including projections of future events and operating performance 

goodwill impairment 

we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually the determination of the value of goodwill requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist with the decision to sell a portion of our self service operations we conducted a goodwill impairment test as of september 30 2009 for both the allocated goodwill associated with the facilities to be disposed of and our ongoing self service reporting unit both tests indicated that the goodwill was not impaired a 10 decrease in the fair value estimate of the self service reporting unit in the september 30 2009 impairment test would not have changed this determination 

effective in the third quarter of 2009 our vehicle replacement products operations were organized into three operating segments composed of our wholesale recycled and aftermarket products self service retail products 

  

and recycled heavyduty truck products we have also concluded that these three operating segments are reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing in 2009 

our goodwill would be considered impaired if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value the fair value estimates are established using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach we believe that using two methods to determine fair value limits the chances of an unrepresentative valuation as of december 31 2009 we had 9388 million in goodwill subject to future impairment tests if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results we determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2009 a 10 decrease in the fair value estimates of the reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2009 impairment test would not have changed this determination 

selfinsurance programs 

we selfinsure a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program we purchase certain stoploss insurance to limit our liability exposure we also selfinsure a portion of our property and casualty risk which includes automobile liability general liability workers’ compensation and property under deductible insurance programs the insurance premium costs are expensed over the contract periods 

we record an accrual for the claims expense related to our employee medical benefits automobile liability general liability and workers’ compensation claims based upon the expected amount of all such claims if actual claims are higher than what we anticipated our accrual might be insufficient to cover our claims costs and we would increase our claims expense in that period to cover the shortfall 

contingencies 

we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business resulting from litigation claims and other commitments and from a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies we accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we determine the amount of reserves if any with the assistance of outside legal counsel we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether the accruals should be adjusted if the amount of an actual loss were greater than the amount we have accrued the excess loss would have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period that the loss occurred if the loss contingency is subsequently determined to no longer be probable the amount of loss contingency previously accrued would be included in our operating results in the period such determination was made 

accounting for income taxes 

all income tax amounts reflect the use of the liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions with different tax rates and we determine the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based upon various estimates and assumptions 

we record a provision for taxes based upon our effective income tax rate we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we expect is more likely than not to be realized we consider historical taxable income expectations and risks associated with our estimates of future taxable income and 

  

ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we had a valuation allowance of 15 million and 09 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively against our deferred tax assets should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment of 15 million to the net deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made conversely should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made 

we recognize the benefits of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns in the provision for income taxes only for those positions that are morelikelythannot to be realized we recognize interest and penalties accrued relating to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax expense in the normal course of business we will undergo tax audits by various tax jurisdictions such audits often require an extended period of time to complete and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits with the adoption of asc 805 on january 1 2009 changes in accruals for uncertainties arising from the resolution of preacquisition contingencies and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances of acquired businesses after the measurement period will be recorded in earnings in the period the changes are determined adjustments to other tax accruals we make are generally recognized in the period they are determined 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for all sharebased payments including employee stock options at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all awards on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award 

several key factors and assumptions affect the valuation models currently utilized for valuing our stock option awards we have been in existence since february 1998 and have been a public company since october 2003 we have elected to use the blackscholes valuation model we use the simplified method in developing an estimate of expected life of share options and will continue to use this method until we have the historical data necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of expected life volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of the option for volatility we considered our own volatility for the time we have been a public company as well as the disclosed volatilities of companies that are considered comparable to us our forfeiture assumption is based on voluntary and involuntary termination behavior as well as historical forfeiture rates we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the dividend yield represents the dividend rate expected to be paid over the option’s expected term and we currently have no plans to pay dividends the riskfree interest rate is based on us treasury zerocoupon issues available at the time each option is granted that have a remaining life approximately equal to the option’s expected life key assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock options granted in 2009 were expected term of 63 years riskfree interest rate of 187 dividend yield of 0 forfeiture rate of 65 and volatility of 446

see “recent accounting pronouncements” in note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information related to new accounting standards 

segment reporting 

over 95 of our operations are conducted in the united states during 2004 we acquired a recycled products business with locations in guatemala and costa rica since 2007 we acquired a total of five recycled 

  

products businesses located in canada keystone which we acquired in october 2007 has bumper refurbishing operations in mexico and aftermarket products businesses located in canada revenue generated and properties located outside of the united states are not material 

during the third quarter of 2009 we modified our management and reporting structure with the change our vehicle replacement products operations were reorganized into three operating segments composed of wholesale recycled and aftermarket products self service retail products and recycled heavyduty truck products these segments are aggregated into one reportable segment because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services customers and methods of distribution 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth statement of income data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated 

 

 year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

revenue our revenue increased 73 to 20 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 from 19 billion for the comparable period of 2008 the increase in revenue was primarily due to the higher volume of products we sold and business acquisitions partially offset by lower service revenue due to lower volumes of crush only vehicles while our total organic revenue increased 19 in 2009 our organic revenue growth rate for parts and services was 70 during the year 

cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased 52 from 10647 million in 2008 to 11201 million in 2009 the increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to increased volume of products sold as a percentage of revenue cost of goods sold decreased from 558 to 547 reductions in acquisition prices for our self service operations contributed to the decline in the cost of goods sold percentage compared to the prior year the ferrous and nonferrous metals markets for scrap declined significantly in the latter part of 2008 and our margins at the self service facilities suffered as we were forced to sell at lower prices than anticipated when we had acquired the product we adjusted our purchasing to take into account the lower sales pricing for vehicles in our self service retail operations and our margins have improved over the course of 2009 our cost of goods sold percentage also decreased due to favorable acquisition prices for our wholesale aftermarket operations in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of lower steel prices 

  

gross margin our gross margin increased 100 from 8438 million in 2008 to 9278 million in 2009 our gross margin increased primarily due to increased volume as a percentage of revenue gross margin increased from 442 to 453 our gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased due primarily to the factors noted above in cost of goods sold 

facility and warehouse expenses facility and warehouse expenses increased 104 from 1821 million in 2008 to 2011 million in 2009 our facility and warehouse expenses increased primarily due to 168 million from business acquisitions and 47 million in higher wages and fringe benefits resulting from increased headcount for field personnel along with higher incentive compensation partially offset by 12 million of lower insurance expense and claims costs and 06 million of lower fuel costs as a percentage of revenue facility and warehouse expenses increased from 95 to 98 due primarily to our acquisition of pyp in the third quarter of 2008 facility and warehouse expenses are typically higher as a percentage of revenue in our self service operations 

distribution expenses distribution expenses increased 13 from 1796 million in 2008 to 1819 million in 2009 our distribution expenses increased primarily due to 66 million from business acquisitions 25 million of higher wages and benefits from an increase in the number of employees and higher incentive compensation higher third party freight of 15 million and higher truck rentals and repairs of 08 million partially offset by lower fuel costs of 106 million as a percentage of revenue our distribution expenses decreased from 94 to 89 primarily due to lower fuel costs on a higher revenue base and delivery route consolidations 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 107 from 2500 million in 2008 to 2767 million in 2009 our business acquisitions accounted for 131 million of the increase primarily in labor and labor related costs our selling expenses tend to rise as revenue increases due to our commissioned sales forces our remaining selling general and administrative expenses increased due primarily to higher labor and labor related expenses of 83 million higher professional fees of 54 million higher telephone and data line expenses of 13 million higher credit card discount and bank fees of 10 million and higher repairs and maintenance expenses of 13 million partially offset by lower bad debt expense of 19 million and lower advertising and promotion expenses of 23 million as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses increased from 131 to 135 primarily due to higher incentive compensation and professional fees 

restructuring expenses restructuring expenses decreased 703 to 26 million in 2009 from 86 million in the comparable period of 2008 the restructuring expenses relate primarily to the integration of keystone into preexisting lkq operations while we do not expect further restructuring expenses related to the keystone acquisition we do expect to incur future restructuring expenses due to the integration of the greenleaf acquisition completed on october 1 2009 see “acquisitions” above for further information concerning the greenleaf transaction 

depreciation and amortization  depreciation and amortization including that reported in cost of goods sold above increased 137 from 329 million in 2008 to 374 million in 2009 business acquisitions accounted for 17 million of the increase in depreciation and amortization expense increased levels of property and equipment accounted for the remaining increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization increased from 16 in 2008 to 17 in 2009 

operating income  operating income increased 197 from 1933 million in 2008 to 2314 million in 2009 as a percentage of revenue operating income increased from 101 to 113 the increase in operating income in dollars and as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to improved gross margins lower fuel costs and lower restructuring expenses 

other income expense total other expense net decreased 235 from 341 million in 2008 to 261 million in 2009 the decrease in other expense net is due primarily to lower net interest expense and a gain on the bargain purchase of greenleaf net interest expense decreased 130 to 309 million in 2009 from 355 

  

million in 2008 our average bank borrowings were approximately 113 million lower in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to scheduled repayments and voluntary prepayments of a portion of 2010 scheduled repayments in addition our average effective interest rate on our bank borrowings was 495 in 2009 compared to 574 in 2008 we realized a gain of 43 million on the bargain purchase of greenleaf in 2009 see note 10 “business combinations” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a further discussion of the acquisition of greenleaf 

provision for income taxes  the provision for income taxes increased 260 from 620 million in 2008 to 782 million in 2009 our effective income tax rate was 390 in 2008 and 381 in 2009 we recorded a 43 million nontaxable gain on bargain purchase related to the greenleaf acquisition which had the effect of lowering the 2009 effective income tax rate by 08 our effective state tax rate increased by 05 in 2009 as a result of state tax law changes and a shift in income to higher rate jurisdictions the effective tax rate for 2009 decreased by 04 compared to 2008 related to unrecognized tax benefits as a result of higher reserve reversals upon the closing of statutes of limitations and a reduced provision for current year unrecognized tax benefits 

income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations decreased 863 from 28 million in 2008 to 04 million in 2009 the decrease was primarily due to 37 million 23 million net of tax in restructuring expenses related to the closing of two self service facilities and an impairment charge of 35 million 22 million net of tax related primarily to leasehold improvements at these closed facilities additionally the discontinued operations reported lower earnings as revenue from scrap metal and other metal sales declined in 2009 primarily as a result of lower commodity prices the year over year decrease was partially offset by a 39 million gain 25 million net of tax on the sale of certain self service facilities in the fourth quarter of 2009 

year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

revenue our revenue increased 716 from 11124 million in 2007 to 19085 million in 2008 the increase in revenue was primarily due to the higher volume of products we sold and business acquisitions in particular the keystone acquisition we also processed a higher volume of vehicles in 2008 which resulted in higher revenue from processing fees and from the sale of scrap and other commodities derived from the dismantling process average scrap metal and other metal prices increased over the prior year but prices decreased in the latter part of 2008 since the october 2007 acquisition of keystone we have been integrating the sale and distribution of our preexisting aftermarket wheel and reconditioned light product offerings with keystone and with our recycled parts operations in order to provide a wider selection of products to our customers from all distribution points organic revenue growth was approximately 87 in 2008 and was calculated assuming we had owned keystone for all of 2007 the integration of our preexisting aftermarket and wheel operations with keystone prevents us from measuring revenue growth between keystone and our preexisting businesses since the acquisition 

cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased 734 from 6140 million in 2007 to 10647 million in 2008 the increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to increased volume of products sold as a percentage of revenue cost of goods sold increased from 552 to 558 our cost of goods sold percentage increased primarily due to lower gross margins at our self service facilities in the latter part of the year the ferrous and nonferrous metals markets for scrap declined significantly in that time and our margins at the self service facilities suffered as we were forced to sell at lower prices than anticipated when we had acquired the product while we adjusted our purchasing to take into account the lower sales pricing for vehicles in our self service retail operations it normally takes several months to fully adjust our buying costs and our margins were hurt as a result the vehicles we purchase for the self service operations are typically much older and the revenue from scrap is a higher percentage of sales than in our wholesale recycled products operation additionally we experienced a difficult buying environment for our self service operations in the fourth quarter which limited our purchases as sellers either held vehicles in anticipation of improving conditions or demanded prices above our assessment of the current market value 

  

gross margin our gross margin increased 693 from 4983 million in 2007 to 8438 million in 2008 our gross margin increased primarily due to increased volume as a percentage of revenue gross margin decreased from 448 to 442 our gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased due primarily to the factors noted above in cost of goods sold 

facility and warehouse expenses facility and warehouse expenses increased 596 from 1141 million in 2007 to 1821 million in 2008 our facility and warehouse expenses increased primarily due to 338 million in higher wages and fringe benefits resulting from increased headcount for field personnel 205 million for higher facility rents taxes and utilities 57 million of higher repairs and maintenance and 29 million of higher supplies expense our acquisition of keystone accounted for a majority of the increase while our acquisition of pyp in august 2008 contributed 98 million to the increase as a percentage of revenue facility and warehouse expenses decreased from 103 to 95 primarily due to better expense leverage on increased revenue 

distribution expenses distribution expenses increased 660 from 1082 million in 2007 to 1796 million in 2008 our distribution expenses increased primarily due to 336 million of higher wage and benefit costs from an increase in the number of employees higher fuel costs of 157 million higher truck rentals and repairs of 96 million and higher third party freight of 94 million our acquisition of keystone accounted for the majority of the increases as a percentage of revenue distribution expenses decreased from 97 to 94 primarily due to better expense leverage on increased revenue 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 789 from 1397 million in 2007 to 2500 million in 2008 the majority of the expense increase was a result of an increase in labor and laborrelated expenses of 736 million due primarily to higher sales commission expenses and increased headcount our selling expenses tend to rise as revenue increases due to our commissioned sales forces our remaining selling general and administrative expenses increased due primarily to higher professional fees of 88 million higher telephone expense of 54 million higher bad debt expense of 44 million higher advertising and promotion of 47 million and higher employee travel expenses of 39 million our acquisition of keystone accounted for a majority of the increases as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses increased from 126 to 131 aftermarket products which became a larger portion of our business with the keystone acquisition have higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than our recycled products 

restructuring expenses restructuring expenses increased from 04 million in 2007 to 86 million in 2008 restructuring expenses include facility and personnel relocation costs severance and lease termination costs that we incurred when we combined some of our existing facilities into keystone facilities we completed the acquisition of keystone on october 12 2007 as of december 31 2008 we had completed the majority of our facility and systems conversions 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization including that reported in cost of goods sold above increased 853 from 178 million in 2007 to 329 million in 2008 our acquisition of keystone accounted for the majority of the increase in depreciation and amortization expense including 30 million of higher amortization for the keystone trade name as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization increased from 15 in 2007 to 16 in 2008 

operating income operating income increased 624 from 1191 million in 2007 to 1933 million in 2008 as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased from 107 to 101 

other income expense net other expense increased 1372 from 144 million in 2007 to 341 million in 2008 net interest expense increased 1219 to 355 million in 2008 from 160 million in 2007 our average bank borrowings increased approximately 4105 million during 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to the keystone acquisition we had 09 million of proceeds from corporate owned life insurance in 2007 we use 

  

corporate owned life insurance policies to fund our obligations under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan as a percentage of revenue net other expense increased from 13 in 2007 to 18 in 2008 due primarily to higher interest expense 

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased 512 from 410 million in 2007 to 620 million in 2008 due primarily to improved operating results our effective tax rate was 390 in 2008 and 392 in 2007 we experienced an increase in our effective state tax rate of 04 compared to the prior year as a result of the keystone acquisition which affected the apportionment of our state income towards higher rate jurisdictions discrete items decreased the effective rate in 2008 as opposed to increasing the effective rate in 2007 in 2008 we identified several state tax credits for which we were eligible and recognized a tax benefit of approximately 12 million in our income tax provision for 2008 provisions for uncertain tax benefits increased relative to the prior year primarily as a result of keystone tax reserves in 2007 we reduced certain deferred tax assets and net income by 06 million due to a change in a state’s income tax law where we have operations which increased our effective rate by 05 this effect was partially offset by the benefit from 09 million of nontaxable life insurance proceeds from corporate owned life insurance 

income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations increased 231 from 23 million in 2007 to 28 million in 2008 due primarily to higher revenue as average scrap prices rose in 2008 compared to the prior year 

2010 outlook 

we estimate that full year 2010 income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the impact of any restructuring expenses will be in the range of 145 million to 155 million and 100 to 106 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of ongoing liquidity are cash flows from our operations and our credit facility at december 31 2009 we had 1089 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately 742 available under our bank credit agreement 100 million commitment less outstanding letters of credit of 258 million see note 6 “longterm obligations” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information on our credit facilities 

on october 27 2009 the bank credit agreement was amended pursuant to the amendment i lehman commercial paper “lcp” resigned from its capacities as the administrative agent and swing line lender and deutsche bank ag new york branch was appointed as the successor administrative agent ii the swing line credit facility was eliminated and iii the revolving credit facility was reduced by 15 million lcp’s portion of the revolver funding commitment thus the total amount now available under our revolving facilities is 100 million 

we do not believe that the changes effected pursuant to the october 27 2009 amendments to the credit agreement will have a material adverse impact on us since we entered into the credit facility in october 2007 our average availability under the revolving facilities excluding the lcp portion has been approximately 73 million and the highest amounts outstanding under our revolving facilities and in the form of letters of credit were 89 million and 265 million respectively we have not utilized the revolving facilities as a primary source of liquidity but we do maintain sufficient availability if needs arise

activities” in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k was 453 before debt issuance cost amortization borrowings against the senior secured credit facility totaled 5957 million and 6383 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively of which 75 million and 198 million are classified as current maturities respectively 

our liquidity needs are primarily to fund working capital requirements and expand our facilities and network the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under some direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles we normally pay for aftermarket parts purchases at the time of shipment or on standard payment terms depending on the manufacturer and payment options offered wheel cores acquired from third parties are normally paid for on standard payment terms we acquired approximately 166500 144500 and 126000 wholesale salvage vehicles in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in addition we acquired approximately 287000 253000 and 174700 lower cost self service and crush only vehicles in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively pyp which was acquired in august 2008 represented 109000 and 33700 of the self service vehicles purchased during 2009 and 2008 respectively we also purchased lower cost self service and crush only vehicles for our discontinued operations of 38800 44000 and 22800 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our purchases of aftermarket parts and wheels totaled approximately 5366 million 4904 million and 1901 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 1640 million in 2009 compared to 1330 million for the same period of 2008 net income adjusted for noncash gains and losses depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation generated 1745 million of cash in 2009 a 333 million increase over the same period of 2008 inventory net of effects of purchase acquisitions represented a cash outflow of 204 million in 2009 we increased our purchases of aftermarket inventory during the first half of 2009 to increase our safety stock for new customer programs and to expand certain product categories to additional locations while we previously expected aftermarket inventory levels to decrease in the second half of 2009 we altered our buying to increase our depth of inventory in response to rising customer demand which caused inventory balances to continue to grow we believe that our purchasing strategy contributed to the increase in aftermarket sales compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 cash receipts from customers increased as a result of improved collections as our receivables net of effects of purchase acquisitions were flat while sales increased by 7 over the prior year our cash outflows related to restructuring activities have declined in 2009 relative to 2008 in 2009 we made payments of 41 million for restructuring costs compared to 166 million in 2008 as the bulk of our keystone integration costs were incurred in 2008 cash paid for income taxes net of refunds was 493 million in 2009 compared to 392 million in 2008 the increase is primarily attributable to higher pretax income in 2009 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1025 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 1389 million for 2008 we invested 683 million of cash in acquisitions in 2009 including 388 million for the greenleaf acquisition in october and received a net 31 million on settlements of purchase price receivables and payables related to 2008 acquisitions in 2008 we spent 742 million for eight acquisitions in october 2009 we completed the sale of certain of our self service yards for 175 million net of cash sold property and equipment purchases were 559 million in 2009 which is 110 million below the capital expenditures for the comparable period in the prior year the reduction in capital expenditures is attributable to fewer facility expansion projects in 2009 lower capital spending related to the keystone integration effort in 2009 and lower capitalizable costs for internal use software development projects our capital spending can vary from year to year depending on our ability to undertake projects and when we reach capacity constraints at a particular facility therefore while we generally expect capital spending to grow in the future as we expand our business the timing of undertaking projects may result in a year over year decline like we experienced in 2009 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 332 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 118 million for 2008 the variance is primarily attributable to debt repayments beginning in the first quarter of 2009 our scheduled term loan payments increased to approximately 49 million per quarter in 2009 compared to 25 million per quarter in the prior year in addition during the 

  

fourth quarter of 2009 we elected to prepay 224 million of our term loan payments scheduled for 2010 we repaid our line of credit borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2009 resulting in a net cash outflow for 2009 of 67 million compared to a cash inflow of 53 million in 2008 which inflow resulted from borrowings to fund a canadian business acquisition repayments of other debt which primarily consists of notes issued for business acquisitions were 17 million for 2009 compared to 63 million in the prior year cash generated from exercises of stock options provided 82 million and 104 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the excess tax benefit from sharebased payment arrangements reduced income taxes payable by 96 million and 125 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 1330 million in 2008 compared to 544 million in 2007 net income adjusted for noncash depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation generated 1412 million of cash in 2008 a 538 million increase over the same period of 2007 working capital uses of cash net of effects of purchase acquisitions included increases in receivables and decreases in accounts payable and other accrued expenses receivables increased primarily due to a growth in revenue accounts payable decreased primarily due to accelerating some of keystone’s vendor payments in order to take advantage of discounts offered for earlier payment inventory net of effects of purchase acquisitions generated a cash inflow of 42 million for 2008 compared to a 351 million outflow in the prior year the reduction in the inventory balance is attributable to a decline in aftermarket inventory resulting from the consolidation of lkq’s former aftermarket operations with keystone’s additionally we experienced a difficult buying environment for our self service operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 which limited our purchases as sellers either held vehicles in anticipation of improving conditions or demanded prices above our assessment of the current market value 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1389 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 9058 million for the same period of 2007 we invested 742 million of cash in eight acquisitions in 2008 compared to 8680 million for 12 acquisitions in the comparable period of 2007 including the acquisition of keystone for cash consideration of approximately 807 million net property and equipment and other long term asset purchases increased 269 million in 2008 which is partially attributable to a full year of capital spending for keystone compared to less than three months in 2007 additionally we continued spending to expand our salvage facilities and develop our operating systems 

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 118 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 9216 million for the same period of 2007 which resulted primarily from the term loan borrowings in october 2007 and the sale of common stock in september 2007 exercises of stock options provided 104 million and 121 million in the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the excess tax benefit from sharebased payment arrangements reduced income taxes payable by 125 million and 193 million in the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively net repayments of longterm debt obligations and line of credit borrowings totaled 109 million in 2008 while net borrowings were 5547 million in 2007 primarily resulting from term loan borrowings of 6510 million for the keystone acquisition 

as part of the consideration for business acquisitions completed during 2009 2008 and 2007 we issued promissory notes totaling approximately 12 million 16 million and 17 million respectively the notes bear interest at annual rates of 20 to 43 and interest is payable at maturity or in monthly installments 

we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of redistribution centers processing facilities and warehouses through further integration of aftermarket refurbished and recycled product facilities and through selected business acquisitions our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions 

we believe that our current cash and equivalents cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements however we may from time to time raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other 

  

arrangements there can be no assurance that additional funding or refinancing of our credit facility if needed will be available on terms attractive to us or at all furthermore any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

2010 outlook 

we estimate that our capital expenditures for 2010 excluding business acquisitions will be between 85 million and 95 million we expect to use these funds for several major facility expansions improvement of current facilities real estate acquisitions and systems development projects maintenance or replacement capital expenditures are expected to be slightly less than 20 of the total for 2010 we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities for 2010 will be approximately 160 million 

offbalance sheet arrangements and future commitments 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to item 303 of regulation sk under the securities exchange act of 1934 additionally we do not have any synthetic leases 

the following table represents our future commitments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 

 

 our longterm debt under contractual obligations above includes interest on the balance outstanding under our variable rate credit facility as of december 31 2009 the long term debt outstanding at december 31 2009 in the above table includes interest computed at the average effective rate of 453 at december 31 2009

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facility where interest rates are tied to either the prime rate or libor in march 2008 we implemented a policy to manage our exposure to variable interest rates on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt instruments through the use of interest rate swap contracts these contracts convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt matching effective and maturity dates to specific debt instruments all of our interest rate swap contracts have been executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy jp morgan chase bank na and deutsche bank ag and are denominated in currency that matches the underlying debt instrument net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swap contracts will be included as adjustments to interest expense in our consolidated income statement as of december 31 2009 three interest rate swap contracts representing a total of 500 million of notional amount were outstanding with various maturity dates through april 2011 all of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and modify the variable rate nature of that portion of our variable rate debt the fair market value of our outstanding interest rate swap contracts at december 31 2009 was a liability of approximately 102 million and the value of such contracts is subject to changes in interest rates 

at december 31 2009 we had unhedged variable rate debt of 957 million using sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of a 100 basis point movement in the interest rate interest expense would change by 10 million annually 

we are also exposed to market risk related to price fluctuations in scrap metal and other metals market prices of these metals affect the amount that we pay for our inventory as well as the revenue that we generate from sales of these metals as both our revenue and costs are affected by the price fluctuations we have a natural hedge against the changes however there is typically a lag between the metal price fluctuations which influence our revenue and any inventory cost changes therefore we can experience positive or negative margin effects in periods of rising or falling metal prices particularly when such prices move rapidly 

additionally we are exposed to currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket parts in taiwan while all transactions with manufacturers based in taiwan are conducted in us dollars changes in the relationship between the us dollar and the taiwan dollar might impact the purchase price of aftermarket parts we might not be able to pass on any price increases to customers under our present policies we do not attempt to hedge this currency exchange rate exposure 

we do not attempt to hedge our foreign currency risk related to our operations in central america and canada as our investment in such operations is not material we maintain a canadian dollar term loan that had a balance of cdn 369 million as of december 31 2009 we have not elected to hedge the foreign currency risk related to this term loan

 item 1 business tableend overview 

we provide replacement systems components and parts needed to repair vehicles cars and trucks buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily four sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers “oems” which are commonly known as oem products new products produced by companies other than the oems which are sometimes referred to as “aftermarket” products recycled products originally produced by oems which we refer to as recycled oem products and used products that have been refurbished we participate in the market for recycled oem products as well as the market for collision repair aftermarket products we obtain aftermarket products and salvage vehicles from a variety of sources and we dismantle the salvage vehicles to obtain a comprehensive range of vehicle products that we distribute into the vehicle repair market we also refurbish bumpers wheels head lamps and tail lamps 

in addition we operate selfservice facilities that sell retail recycled automotive products retail customers are given access to salvage vehicles and allowed to remove the parts they desire to purchase in 2008 we acquired a company with multiple selfservice facilities in the state of california and three companies in the heavyduty truck recycled parts business the heavyduty truck acquisitions represent an expansion of our business into an area that we believe is complementary to our existing business 

we believe that our business is environmentally responsible our recycled automotive products provide an alternative to the manufacture of new products which would require the expenditure of significantly more resources and energy and would generate a substantial amount of additional pollution also we recycle materials such as fuel motor oil and freon from the salvage vehicles that we procure in addition we save landfill space because the parts that we recycle would otherwise be discarded 

we are the largest nationwide provider of recycled oem products and related services with sales processing and distribution facilities that reach most major markets in the us in october 2007 we acquired keystone automotive industries inc the nation’s leading distributor of aftermarket collision replacement products as a result we are the largest nationwide provider of aftermarket collision replacement products and refurbished bumper covers and wheels 

we procure salvage vehicles primarily at auctions using our locally based professionals proprietary processes and a disciplined procurement system in addition as an alternative source of salvage vehicles we obtain some inventory directly from insurance companies vehicle manufacturers and other suppliers once we have received proper title which serves as a safeguard that the vehicles have not been stolen we dismantle such vehicles for recycled oem products we purchase aftermarket products from manufacturers primarily in taiwan using proprietary order management systems 

our customers include collision and mechanical repair shops and indirectly insurance companies including extended warranty companies the majority of our products and services are sold to collision repair 

  

shops also known as body shops and mechanical repair shops we indirectly rely on insurance companies which ultimately pay the collision repair shops for the repair of insured vehicles as a source of business these insurance companies exert significant influence in the vehicle repair decision and we provide a nationwide source for consistency quality and availability of replacement products because of their importance to the process we have formed business relationships with certain insurance companies and with certain extended warranty providers in order to be their preferred vehicle alternative parts supplier for example with some insurance companies we have vehicle repair order estimate review programs in place and provide their claims adjusters a part quote and locator service in addition we provide them an outlet to dispose of certain total loss vehicles directly to us we provide extended warranty companies a single national call desk to service their nationwide needs for mechanical products 

we believe we provide customers a value proposition that includes high quality products extensive product availability due to our regional inventory trading zones product costs lower than new oem products and quick delivery we provide benefits to repair shops and insurance companies because the lower costs for our products enable many vehicles to be repaired rather than declared a total loss by expanding our product offerings to include recycled oem products aftermarket products and refurbished bumpers wheels and head and tail lamps we now offer customers an extensive range of vehicle replacement products we believe this unique combination of recycled aftermarket and refurbished products allows us to serve as a “onestop” solution for our customers looking for the most cost advantageous way to repair vehicles 

our history 

we believe we were the first recycler of light vehicle products to achieve a national network and presence since our formation in 1998 we have grown through both internal development and acquisitions our acquisition strategy has been to target companies with strategic locations and significant market presence strong management teams a record of environmental compliance solid growth prospects and a reputation for quality and customer service 

in february 2004 we expanded our product offerings by acquiring a supplier of aftermarket products and a provider of selfservice retail recycled vehicle products in january 2006 we acquired an aluminum alloy wheel refurbishing business in january 2007 we acquired a head and tail lamp refurbishing company in october 2007 we significantly increased our size by acquiring keystone automotive industries inc at the time of the acquisition keystone was the leading distributor of aftermarket collision replacement parts keystone also refurbished alloy wheels which added to our existing wheel business the keystone acquisition also expanded our product offerings with refurbished bumpers and paint and other materials used in the repair of damaged vehicles in march 2008 we acquired our first heavyduty truck recycled parts business 

our strengths 

we provide a national solution to insurance companies and extended warranty providers 

we believe that our nationwide presence gives us a unique ability to service the major automobile insurance companies and extended warranty providers insurance companies and extended warranty providers operate generally at a national or regional level and play a critical role in the repair process we believe we provide a direct benefit to these companies by lowering the cost of repairs decreasing the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and providing a replacement product that is of comparable quality to the part replaced specifically we assist insurance companies by purchasing insured total loss vehicles and by providing cost effective products through sales to collision repair shops especially to repair shops that are part of an insurance company network we also provide a review of vehicle repair order estimates to insurance companies so they may assess the opportunity to increase usage of recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished products for extended warranty providers we provide a single national call desk to service their nationwide need for mechanical products 

  

we believe we have the only national network for alternative automotive replacement products and it would be difficult to replicate 

we have invested significant capital developing a national network of recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished product facilities that serves most major metropolitan areas in the us we have differentiated ourselves from our local competitors and made replication of our network difficult by developing our network through purchasing anchor companies that were among the largest companies in the industry the difficulty and time required to obtain proper zoning as well as dismantling and other environmental permits necessary to operate newlysited recycled oem facilities would make establishing such new facilities challenging in addition there are difficulties associated with recruiting and hiring an experienced management team that has strong industry knowledge and local relationships with customers finally our national network allows us to enter new adjacent markets quickly by establishing redistribution facilities which avoids the need for local dismantling capabilities and inventory 

we benefit from a local presence 

our network of facilities allows us to develop and maintain our relationships with local repair shops while providing a level of service to insurance companies and national customers that is made possible by our nationwide presence our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries that our customers require using drivers who routinely deliver to the same customers our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network 

we have a proven and effective procurement process 

we use information systems and methodologies designed to enable us to procure salvage vehicles and aftermarket products costeffectively as our largest single expenditure efficient procurement of salvage vehicles and aftermarket products is critical to the growth operating results and cash flow of our business our processes and knowhow allow us to identify and value the parts that can be recycled on a damaged vehicle at auction and to determine rapidly the maximum price we will pay for the vehicle in order to achieve our target margins on resale of the recycled oem products we carefully analyze the market and obtain aftermarket products and salvage vehicles of the type whose parts are in demand at prices that we believe will allow us to sell products profitably we have also taken advantage of our relationships with insurance companies and vehicle manufacturers to obtain salvage vehicles outside the auction process 

we have a broad and deep inventory of products 

we believe that our customers place a high value on availability of a broad range of vehicle replacement products we also believe that our inventory of recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished products allows us to fill a higher percentage of our customers’ orders than our competitors in addition our ability to share inventory on a regional basis increases the availability of replacement products and also helps us to fill a higher percentage of our customers’ orders we have developed regional trading zones within which we make our inventory available to our local facilities mostly via overnight product transfers we manage our inventory and purchasing on a regional basis to enhance the availability of the products that we believe will be in the highest demand within each region our broad and deep inventory furthers our ability to serve as a “onestop” solution for our customers’ recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished product needs 

we have implemented management disciplines 

our management and operations team is highly experienced with many managers having spent their entire careers in the vehicle replacement parts industry we have developed and built procurement operating and 

  

financial systems that have allowed us to grow and develop our national network and implement professional management techniques and disciplines as our business has grown we have acquired additional management talent that has furthered the sharing of best practices throughout the company in addition our senior management team has extensive acquisition experience and will continue to use our disciplined approach in targeting growth opportunities 

our strategies 

strengthen our north american network through internal growth and acquisitions 

we intend to continue to expand our market coverage through a combination of internal development and acquisitions and to look for opportunities to expand into new regions and into adjacent markets we plan to establish a presence in additional metropolitan markets and a number of smaller markets in north america we have applied an analytical and disciplined approach to our acquisition process and have targeted companies with strong management teams a record of environmental compliance solid growth prospects and a reputation for quality and customer service we have also expanded our product offerings and will continue to consider additional opportunities to expand our product offerings 

further develop business relationships 

we intend to continue to develop business relationships with automobile insurance companies extended warranty providers and other industry participants we believe that insurance companies and extended warranty providers as payors for many repairs will take a more active role in the selection of replacement products in the repair process in order to use lower cost alternatives to new oem products on behalf of certain insurance company customers we provide a review of vehicle repair order estimates so they may assess the opportunity to increase usage of recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished products in the repair process thereby reducing their costs our employees also provide quotes for our products to assist several insurance companies with their estimate and settlement processes we also work with insurance companies and vehicle manufacturers to procure salvage vehicles directly from them on a selected basis which provides us an additional source of supply and provides them improved economics on salvage vehicle sales we believe we are positioned to take advantage of the increasing importance of these industry participants and will continue to look for ways to enhance our relationships 

continue to improve our operating results 

we are working to improve our operating results by applying our business disciplines to our most recently acquired facilities continuing to build our network further centralizing certain functions improving our use of technology and increasing revenue at our lower volume facilities our higher volume facilities generally operate at a higher profitability level as a percentage of revenue we believe we can improve the profitability level at our lower volume facilities by achieving the higher volumes and improved economies of scale that we realize at our higher volume facilities we intend to continue to refine our procurement system which uses methodologies that analyze demand levels for our products existing inventory levels and projected margins 

further develop our technology and business processes 

we continue to emphasize the use of technology in our processes to improve efficiency and to increase the standardization of our business we continue to develop our technology to allow us to better manage and analyze our inventory to assist our salespeople with uptodate pricing and availability of our products and to further enhance our procurement process for example many of our representatives responsible for procuring vehicles whom we refer to as “scouts” are equipped with handheld computing devices to assist them in appraising the vehicles prior to submitting a bid to purchase the vehicle 

  

raise industry standards by being the industry leader 

since our inception we have employed a professional approach to the vehicle recycling business and have applied the same approach to our aftermarket and refurbishing businesses our leadership position in the collision repair aftermarket industry was further enhanced with our acquisition of keystone which was the largest provider of collision repair aftermarket products we continue to seek new ways to improve our methodologies and to communicate our standards to our customers we believe that by elevating industry standards in areas such as customer service integrity product quality and availability delivery time warranty support environmental compliance and appearance of facilities we can help promote the acceptability of the use of recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished products 

our process 

our operations generally involve the procurement of inventory vehicle processing in the case of recycled oem products sales and distribution we also perform refurbishing of oem wheels bumpers head lamps and tail lamps such refurbishing work is primarily cosmetic 

procurement of inventory 

we start the process of procuring recycled oem products for our wholesale operations by acquiring severely damaged or totaled vehicles we acquired approximately 144500 salvage vehicles for our wholesale operations in 2008 we purchase the majority of our vehicles for our wholesale operations from salvage auctions wrecked vehicles are sold at salvage auctions held each weekday throughout the country salvage auctions provide an outlet for salvage vehicles to be processed and sold primarily to automotive recyclers and rebuilders we pay third parties fees to tow the vehicles from the auction to our facilities salvage auctions charge fees both to the supplier of vehicles primarily insurance companies and to the purchaser including us 

for the vast majority of our salvage auction purchases we send a scout in advance of each auction to investigate the vehicles we would be interested in buying the scout obtains key information such as the model mileage and damage assessment and determines which parts on the targeted vehicles are recyclable this information is electronically forwarded to our bid specialists via handheld computing devices or facsimile transmissions the bid specialists analyze the data in light of current demand for the parts in question the levels of our inventory with respect to such parts and the projected margins expected for each vehicle the specialists then set a maximum bid price that our bidders use to purchase the vehicle at auction we believe that this system provides a disciplined approach to procurement 

we also obtain salvage vehicles and parts from insurance companies vehicle manufacturers abandoned vehicle programs and other salvage sources some of these arrangements allow us to acquire salvage vehicles directly from the insurance company or vehicle manufacturer at a cost calculated as a percentage of revenue which is remitted as products are sold from these vehicles these arrangements eliminate the fees we and the insurance company would otherwise pay to the salvage auction and provide us inventory with a lower initial expenditure of capital 

we acquire inventory for our selfservice recycled oem products operations from a variety of sources including but not limited to auctions towing companies municipalities insurance carriers charitable organizations and the general public in 2008 we purchased approximately 297000 lower cost selfservice and crush only vehicles 

we purchase aftermarket products from independent manufacturers primarily in taiwan and the united states we purchased and imported approximately 38 of our aftermarket products directly from manufacturers in taiwan and other asian countries approximately 62 of our aftermarket products have been purchased from locations in the united states however we believe that the majority of these products are manufactured in 

  

taiwan and other asian countries no single supplier currently provides more than 21 of our aftermarket products we use proprietary order management systems to procure our aftermarket inventory the systems initiate inventory purchases based on stocking levels and historical sales data we believe that the systems help us to procure our aftermarket inventory efficiently and to maintain one of the highest fulfillment rates in the aftermarket products industry 

vehicle processing 

vehicle processing for our wholesale operations involves dismantling a salvage vehicle into recycled oem products ready for delivery when a salvage vehicle arrives at one of our facilities an inventory specialist identifies catalogs and schedules the vehicle for dismantling we do not dismantle the vehicle until we have received proper title documentation which serves as a safeguard that the vehicle was not stolen 

the dismantler removes components that will become products for sale products that are placed directly on inventory shelves generally include such items as the engine transmission hood trunk lid head and tail lamp assemblies rear bumper and doors we remove all recyclable items including fluids freon batteries tires and catalytic converters these items are sold to recyclers and reprocessors dismantlers also perform any required cutting of the vehicle frame or body 

each inventory item is entered into our inventory tracking system inspected for quality tagged for identification and prepared for storage and delivery to our customers mechanical products not in a condition to be sold as recycled products or that are in surplus supply are separated and sold in bulk to parts remanufacturers while the wheel bumper and lighting items are sent to our refurbishing facilities the remaining vehicle hulks and components such as fabrics rubber plastics and glass are sold to scrap processors 

the processing of vehicles for our selfservice recycled oem products operations involves removal of all recyclable items including the fluids freon batteries and catalytic converters the vehicles are then moved to a site on our retail lots and made available for customers to remove parts 

refurbishing process 

we refurbish both chrome plated bumpers and plastic bumper covers the refurbishing process for chrome plated bumpers generally includes some or all of the following steps straightening or reforming to original dimensions welding breaks or cracks surface grinding to remove rust or corrosion chemical stripping to remove the original electroplated finishes metal polishing and buffing electroplating layers of copper or nickel and chromium and inspecting and packaging 

the refurbishing process for plastic bumper covers generally includes some or all of the following steps straightening or reforming to original dimensions with heat sanding or sandblasting the surface using plastic welding techniques when necessary finishing the surface with various epoxies and similar materials painting texturing and color coating as needed and inspecting and packaging 

we refurbish steel and alloy wheels the refurbishing process for wheels generally includes some or all of the following steps straightening welding minor dents or chips handdetailing painting machining applying a clear powder coat and inspecting and packaging 

we refurbish head and tail lamps the refurbishing process for lamps includes a proprietary method of repairing the housing sanding and buffing to remove imperfections cleaning the lamp recoating the lens with a uv protectant coat reassembling and inspecting and packaging 

  

our refurbished products are processed from cores obtained from our recycled oem locations from customers and from brokers the higher quality cores are then refurbished for popular wheels we also purchase aftermarket wheels from outside vendors to fill demand 

sales 

as of december 31 2008 we employed 620 fulltime sales staff in our wholesale recycled oem products operations of these 571 were located at sales desks at our facilities and generally are responsible for accepting incoming calls from and selling our inventory to our customers we put all of our sales personnel through a thorough training program most of our sales personnel are paid primarily on a commission basis in addition as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 49 traveling sales staff who visit our customers and focus on business development in various markets 

in our aftermarket products operations sales orders are accepted either by our aftermarket and refurbished products sales personnel at our sales call centers or by our route sales persons as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 589 employees selling aftermarket and refurbished products at such call centers and approximately 1366 route sales persons selling aftermarket and refurbished products to the customers they visit 

as part of the integration of keystone into our preexisting operations we initiated a program to encourage cross selling of aftermarket and recycled oem products to our customers in late 2008 we provided access to keystone’s point of sales system to our recycled oem products sales staff we have also created better links for keystone’s sales staff to refer customers to our recycled oem products sales staff frequently when recycled oem parts are unavailable or out of stock we are able to fill the order with aftermarket parts from keystone’s inventory 

we are continually reviewing and revising the pricing of our recycled oem products our pricing specialists take into consideration factors such as location recent demand inventory quantity inventory turnover new oem product prices recycled oem product prices aftermarket and refurbished product prices and remanufactured part prices with the goal of optimizing revenue we update the pricing of our aftermarket and refurbished products at least annually when we update our product catalogs or when standard pricing guides are provided to estimating systems we may adjust prices during the year in response to material price changes of oem products 

the inventory base of each of our facilities supplemented by the inventory sharing system within our regional trading zones gives us what we believe to be a competitive advantage through our ability to meet our customers’ requirements more frequently than smaller competitors 

distribution 

each sale results in the generation of a work order a dispatcher is then responsible for ensuring product accuracy printing the final invoice and including the products on the appropriate truck route for delivery to the customer we operate a delivery fleet of mediumsized trucks and smaller trucks and vans these trucks deliver products to our customers within a specified territory typically on a daily basis in markets where we offer recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished products we often deliver more than one product type on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs 

additionally we have developed an internal distribution network to allow our sales representatives to sell recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished products from the inventory of nearby facilities within our regional trading zones thus improving our ability to fulfill customer requests and accelerating inventory turnover each weekday we operate approximately 245 transfer runs between our facilities generally within our trading zones that carry recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished products in addition we have approximately 2400 local delivery routes serving our customers each weekday 

  

our products 

when we procure salvage vehicles for our wholesale operations we focus on vehicles for which the insured repair market has the most recycled oem product demand these tend to be popular types of vehicles such as sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks and automobile models with high sales volume these vehicles generally are a few model years old as insurers tend to use new oem products on repairs of vehicles that are one to two years old similarly insurers are less likely to authorize the repair of vehicles more than ten model years old the degree of damage is not a significant factor in our process as we assign value only to the undamaged products when we prepare our bids 

our most popular recycled oem products include engines transmissions vehicle front end assemblies doors trunk lids bumper assemblies wheels head and tail lamp assemblies mirrors fenders and axles 

we typically procure salvage vehicles that are more than seven model years old for our selfservice retail recycled products operations these vehicles are placed in our selfservice yards where retail customers pay a fee for entry the customers remove parts from the vehicles and pay us for the parts they desire to purchase 

when we obtain a mechanical product wheels bumpers or certain lighting products from a dismantled vehicle and determine that we have an excess supply of such product or it is defective the mechanical item is then sold in bulk to mechanical remanufacturers while the wheel bumper and lighting items are sent to our refurbishing locations we refer to these items as core products the majority of the mechanical products are transferred to our core facility in houston texas where we sort them by product and model type examples of such products are engine blocks and heads transmissions starters alternators and air conditioner compressors 

when we procure aftermarket products and decide which wheels bumpers and lights to refurbish we focus on products that are in the most demand by the insured repair market our most popular aftermarket products are head lamps tail lamps grilles hoods mirrors bumpers bumper covers and fenders we offer paint and related repair materials like tape sandpaper paint guns and frame racks so that our customers can purchase these products and the alternative automotive repair parts from a single source 

in 1987 the certified automotive parts association “capa” was founded to provide insurance companies distributors collision repair shops and consumers with an objective method of evaluating the functional equivalence of aftermarket collision replacement products and oem collision replacement products capa a nonprofit association of insurance companies manufacturers importers distributors collision repair shops and consumer groups establishes the specifications for tests and certifies the quality of aftermarket collision replacement products through independent testing laboratories capa develops engineering specifications for aftermarket collision replacement products based upon an examination of oem parts certifies the factories manufacturing processes and quality control procedures used by independent manufacturers and certifies the materials fit and finish of specific aftermarket collision replacement products many major insurance companies have adopted policies recommending or requiring the use of parts certified by capa when available we distribute parts certified by capa when available and actively participate with capa insurance companies and consumer groups in encouraging independent manufacturers of collision replacement products to seek capa certification 

our wholesale and selfservice operations generate scrap metal and other metals that we sell after we dismantle a salvage vehicle for wholesale parts and after vehicles have been used in our selfservice business the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors and other metals are sold to processors and brokers of metal in addition we receive “crush only” vehicles from other companies including oems which we dismantle and that generate scrap and other metals 

  

our customers 

insurance companies 

we consider automobile insurance companies our customers as they are a key demand driver for our products our products are delivered directly to the repair shop or installer because insurance companies and extended warranty providers generally do not take receipt of repair parts while insurance companies do not pay for our products directly the insurance company does ultimately pay for the repair costs of the insured vehicle in excess of any deductible amount as a result the insurance company often exerts significant influence in the decisionmaking process as to how a damaged vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the product used in the repair process insurance companies are also concerned with customer satisfaction with the repair process and the total time to return the repaired vehicle to its owner 

repair shops and others 

we sell the majority of our products wholesale to collision repair shops and mechanical repair shops the majority of these customers tend to be individuallyowned small businesses although there has been a trend toward consolidation resulting in the formation of several national and regional repair companies we also sell our products to automobile dealerships and fleet management groups in addition we sell our products to individual retail customers at our selfservice retail locations and at certain of our wholesale recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished product locations 

remanufacturers 

a mechanical part that is not suitable for sale as a replacement part or that is a product for which we have an excess supply is sold to mechanical remanufacturers in bulk shipments examples of mechanical parts we sell in this manner are engine blocks and heads transmissions starters alternators and air conditioner compressors remanufacturers usually are significantly larger companies than repair shops our sales to them tend to be large orders and are dependent on their needs for a certain product line 

our employees 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 9600 employees in july 2006 approximately 60 of our employees at our totowa new jersey facility voted to be represented by a union we signed a collective bargaining agreement with the union in july 2007 approximately 200 of our employees at our bumper refurbishing plant in mexico and approximately 130 of our employees at our recycled oem parts facility in quebec city canada are also represented by unions other than these locations none of our employees is a member of a union or participates in other collective bargaining arrangements 

our facilities 

our corporate headquarters are located at 120 north lasalle street suite 3300 chicago illinois 60602 the lease for our corporate headquarters expires in july 2011 we also have regional offices throughout the united states all of which perform corporate functions the primary functions performed at our corporate offices are financial accounting treasury marketing business development human resources information systems support and legal in addition to our corporate offices we have numerous operating facilities that handle recycled oem aftermarket refurbished and selfservice retail products we operate out of a total of approximately 280 physical locations a majority of these locations are leased some of our locations stock multiple product types thus some of our facilities may be described under more than one category below 

recycled oem parts 

our wholesale recycled oem parts facilities are located among nine geographic regions a typical facility has processing sales and distribution operations including a large warehouse with multiple bays to dismantle 

  

vehicles indoor and outdoor storage areas and administrative and sales offices equipment typically used at each facility includes hydraulic lifts forklifts and loaders and hand tools to dismantle vehicles we also have facilities that operate primarily as redistribution centers as of december 31 2008 we conducted our wholesale recycled oem parts operations from 73 facilities 57 of which include a combination of processing sales and redistribution operations and 16 of which are primarily redistribution facilities we also have five recycled oem parts facilities in central america further we have three heavyduty truck operations one core processing facility and one aluminum smelter 

aftermarket parts 

we conduct our aftermarket parts business from facilities that serve as sales warehousing or distribution centers for these parts as of december 31 2008 we conducted our aftermarket parts operations from 152 facilities in the united states and canada 

refurbished parts 

we refurbish bumpers and wheels at 54 locations in the united states and canada and one location in northeast mexico we refurbish head lamps and tail lamps primarily at a facility in grand rapids michigan 

selfservice retail parts 

our selfservice retail parts facilities typically consist of several acres of vehicles stored outdoors and a retail building through which customers access the vehicles as of december 31 2008 we conducted our selfservice retail parts operations from 38 facilities in north america 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry we consider all suppliers of vehicle products to be competitors including other recycled oem businesses oems parts remanufacturers suppliers of aftermarket and refurbished products and internetbased suppliers we believe the principal areas of competition in our industry include availability of inventory pricing product quality and service 

we compete with more than 6000 domestic vehicle product recyclers most of which are singleunit operators we believe most of the vehicle parts recyclers in the us have less than 30 million in annual revenue in some markets smaller competitors have organized affiliations to share marketing and distribution resources greenleaf llc which is owned by schnitzer steel industries inc is our largest competitor in the light vehicle oem product recycling business schnitzer has operations in the steel manufacturing metals recycling and vehicle product recycling businesses and also is a significant operator in the selfservice retail recycling business 

we also compete with distributors of aftermarket and refurbished collision light vehicle products the distribution of aftermarket collision parts is highly fragmented and our competitors other than oems generally are independently owned distributors having from one to three distribution centers 

manufacturers of new original equipment parts sell the majority of light vehicle replacement products we believe however that as the insurance and repair industries come to appreciate the advantages of recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished products those products can account for a larger percentage of total vehicle replacement product sales 

information technology 

we use a single third party facility management system in most of our wholesale recycled oem operations we believe that a single system helps us with the continued implementation of standard operating procedures 

  

training efficiency employee transferability access to a national inventory database management reporting and data storage it also eliminates the need to create multiple versions of proprietary applications and systems support processes 

the major features of our facility management systems include inventory control customer selling and billing sales analysis vehicle tracking and profitability reporting the systems also support an electronic exchange system for identifying and locating parts at other selected recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock 

we have separate third party providers for our financial systems such as financial and budget reporting general ledger accounting accounts payable payroll and fixed assets we intend to implement a common financial reporting system throughout our organization 

we currently protect our local customer inventory and corporate consolidated data such as financial information email files and other user files with daily backups these backups are stored off site with a third party data protection vendor 

we have consolidated our facility management systems onto regional system platforms the hardware for all such platforms is located at a single data center the center is in a secure environment with aroundtheclock monitoring redundant power backup and multiple diverse data and telecommunication routing facility management system data is “mirrored” replicated off site in real time to a disaster recovery facility located in a different part of the country this disaster recovery facility is also housed in a secure environment with aroundtheclock monitoring redundant power backup and multiple diverse data and telecommunications routing 

we use a single third party facility management system in most of our aftermarket operations we expect to convert the remaining few locations that use a separate system in 2009 additional third party software packages have been implemented to leverage the centralized data and information that a single system provides such as a data warehouse to conduct enhanced analytics and reporting an integrated budgeting system an electronic data interchange tool and ecommerce tools to enhance our online businesstobusiness initiatives orderkeystonecom and keyless 

our critical aftermarket management systems are housed at a thirdparty off site data center that is fully redundant across its infrastructure to ensure that operations are continuously maintained the data center is secure and monitored 24 hours a day throughout the year by skilled technical staff systems are backed up daily and stored off site with a third party storage and archiving company 

we use a single facility management system in most of our refurbishing operations we are evaluating the options to standardize the facility management systems relating to our heavyduty truck and selfservice operations 

we continually evaluate our systems with the goal of ensuring that all critical systems remain scalable and operational as we continue to grow 

regulation 

environmental compliance 

our operations and properties including the maintenance of our delivery vehicles are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations these environmental laws govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment 

  

identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials 

we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters we have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements we cannot assure you however that we will at all times be in complete compliance with such requirements 

although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot assure you that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

contamination resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release storage transportation or disposal of gasoline motor oil antifreeze transmission fluid cfcs from air conditioners other hazardous materials or metals such as aluminum cadmium chromium lead and mercury contamination from the refurbishment of chrome plated bumpers can occur from the release of the plating material contamination can migrate onsite or offsite which can increase the risk and the amount of any potential liability 

in addition many of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use that may have involved hazardous materials as a result some of our properties may be contaminated some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination even if these owners or operators did not know of and were not responsible for such contamination these environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of treats or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties or successors to such owners or operators for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 

when we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process we analyze the risks and when appropriate perform further environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination furthermore where appropriate we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters in addition at times we or sellers from whom we purchased a business have undertaken remediation projects we do not anticipate based on currently available information and current laws that we will incur liabilities in excess of reserves to address environmental matters however in the event we discover new information or if laws change we may incur significant liabilities which may exceed our reserves 

title laws 

in some states when a vehicle is deemed a total loss a salvage title is issued whether states issue salvage titles is important to the supply of inventory for the vehicle recycling industry because an increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles currently these titling issues are a matter of state law in 1992 the us congress commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle titling registration and salvage since then legislation has been introduced seeking to establish national uniform requirements in this area including a uniform definition of a salvage vehicle the vehicle recycling industry will generally favor a uniform definition since it will avoid inconsistencies across state lines and will generally favor a definition that expands the number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage however certain interest groups including repair shops and some insurance 

  

associations may oppose this type of legislation national legislation has not yet been enacted in this area and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in the future 

anticar theft act 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any “covered major part” the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on vehicle recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may further discourage the use by such shops of recycled products 

legislation affecting automotive repair parts 

most states have laws that restrict the use of aftermarket parts in collision repair work these restrictions range from the requirement to disclose to the vehicle owner the use of aftermarket parts in the repair process to the requirement to have aftermarket parts certified by an independent testing organization some jurisdictions have laws that prohibit or restrict the sale of certain recycled oem products that we provide such as airbags additional laws of this kind may be introduced in the future an increase in the number of states passing such legislation or the passing of legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on our business additionally congress could enact federal legislation restricting the use of aftermarket and recycled automotive parts in the repair process 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather related accidents in addition the cost of salvage vehicles tends to be lower as weather related accidents generate a larger supply of total loss vehicles 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend risks relating to our business 

our operating results and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the economic conditions in the united states 

the recent declining economic conditions in the us have adversely impacted our business such conditions have resulted in fewer miles driven fewer accident claims and a reduction of vehicle repairs in the event that the us economic conditions do not improve or continue to decline we expect that our business will continue to be negatively affected 

we face intense competition from local national and internetbased vehicle products providers and this competition could negatively affect our business 

the vehicle replacement products industry is highly competitive and is served by numerous suppliers of oem products recycled oem products aftermarket products and refurbished products within each of these categories of suppliers there are local owneroperated companies larger regional suppliers national providers 

  

and internetbased suppliers providers of vehicle replacement products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of vehicle replacement products which may further increase competition some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise greater financial technical manufacturing distribution and other resources longer operating histories lower cost structures and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries than we do in certain regions of the us local vehicle recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in the recycled oem products industry as a result of these factors our competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply provide their products at lower costs or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve 

we believe that substantially in excess of 50 of collision parts by dollar amount are supplied by oems with the balance being supplied by distributors like us the oems are therefore in a position to exert pricing pressure in the marketplace we compete with the oems primarily on price and to a lesser extent on perceived quality from time to time oems have experimented with reducing prices on specific products to meet the lowerpriced alternative products if such price reductions were to become widespread it could have a material adverse impact on our business 

claims by oems relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business 

oems have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims the oems have brought such claims in federal court and with the united states international trade commission since our acquisition of keystone automotive industries inc in october 2007 the distribution of aftermarket products constitutes a significantly larger percentage of our business 

in december 2005 ford global technologies llc initiated a complaint with the international trade commission against six companies including keystone alleging that certain aftermarket parts imported into the united states infringed on 14 design patents held by ford global in december 2006 an administrative law judge of the international trade commission preliminarily ruled that seven of the ford global design patents were valid and that the importation of automotive parts covered by these seven patents violated section 337 of the tariff act of 1930 the international trade commission affirmed the ruling of the administrative law judge and issued an order prohibiting further importation of automotive parts covered by the patents the parties to the action have appealed the decision to the united states circuit court of appeals for the federal circuit 

in may 2008 ford global filed another complaint with the international trade commission the complaint alleges that lkq corporation keystone automotive industries inc and six other entities import and sell certain automotive parts relating to the 2005 ford mustang that infringe eight ford design patents on may 29 2008 the international trade commission issued a notice of investigation based on ford’s complaint and has set november 2009 as the target date for completion of the investigation 

united states patent and trademark office records indicate that oems are seeking and obtaining more design patents then they have in the past to the extent that the oems are successful with intellectual property infringement claims we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business we will likely incur significant expenses investigating and defending intellectual property infringement claims in addition an unexpected result of the intellectual property infringement litigation is that capa is decertifying parts that are the subject of the claims lack of capa certification may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of capa certified aftermarket parts 

  

an adverse change in our relationships with auction companies or our suppliers could increase our expenses and hurt our ability to serve our customers 

most of our salvage inventory is obtained from vehicles offered at salvage auctions by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the us we do not have contracts with any auction company according to industry analysts a small number of companies controls a large percentage of the salvage auction market in the us if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions or significantly raised its fees our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers moreover we are facing increased competition in the purchase of salvage vehicles from shredders and scrap recyclers internetbased buyers and others this increase in the number of bidders may increase our cost of goods sold for recycled oem products most states regulate bidders to help ensure that salvage vehicles are purchased for legal and legitimate purposes auction companies have been actively seeking to reduce or eliminate these regulations which if successful would further increase the number of bidders 

we also acquire inventory directly from insurance companies oems aftermarket parts manufacturers and others to the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue these arrangements our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers 

we are dependent on a relatively small number of suppliers of aftermarket products although alternative suppliers exist for substantially all aftermarket products distributed by us the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on us until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced providing products moreover our operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad including among other things transportation delays political instability currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs import and export controls and other nontariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas as well as the uncertainty regarding future relations between china and taiwan because a substantial volume of our sales involves parts manufactured from sheet metal we can be adversely impacted if sheet metal becomes unavailable or is only available at higher prices which we may not be able to pass on to our customers 

if our business relationships with insurance companies end we may lose important sales opportunities 

we rely on business relationships with several insurance companies these insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide our arrangements with these companies may be terminated at any time we rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in an illinois lawsuit involving state farm mutual automobile insurance company  “avery v state farm”  a jury decided in october 1999 that state farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using nonoem parts to repair damaged vehicles when use of such parts did not restore the vehicle to its “preloss condition” the jury found that state farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of nonoem parts and the alleged inferiority of those parts the jury assessed damages against state farm of 456 million and the judge assessed an additional 730 million of disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the illinois consumer fraud act in april 2001 the illinois appellate court upheld the verdict but reduced the damage award by 130 million because of duplicative damage awards on august 18 2005 the illinois supreme court reversed the awards made by the circuit court and found among other things that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any breach of contract on the part of state farm the us supreme court declined to hear an appeal of this case as a result of this case some insurance companies had reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket products our financial results could be affected perhaps adversely if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled oem products from us due to a fear of similar claims with respect to such products 

  

we may not be able to sell our products due to existing or new laws and regulations prohibiting or restricting the sale of recycled oem aftermarket or refurbished products 

some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled oem products that we provide such as airbags these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled oem products restrictions on the products we are able to sell could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

most states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair work andor require enhanced disclosure or vehicle owner consent before using aftermarket products in such repair work additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future if additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business 

certain organizations test the quality and safety of vehicle replacement products in the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product such events could adversely affect our business 

we may not be able to successfully acquire new operations or integrate acquisitions which could cause our business to suffer 

we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms or for other reasons if we buy a company or a division of a company we may experience difficulty integrating that company’s or division’s personnel and operations which could negatively affect our operating results in addition 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the acquisition of keystone in october 2007 was our largest acquisition to date because of the magnitude of the keystone acquisition significant integration challenges remain including the realization of the total projected cost savings synergies and revenue enhancements that we anticipated 

in connection with future acquisitions we may assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire these liabilities including liabilities for environmentalrelated costs could materially and adversely affect our business we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition the issuance of which could involve the imposition of restrictive covenants or be dilutive to our existing stockholders 

financing the keystone acquisition substantially increased our leverage and involves restrictions on our business 

in connection with the acquisition of keystone we entered into a senior secured debt financing facility with a group of lenders our total outstanding indebtedness including bank financing letters of credit and notes 

  

payable in connection with acquisitions as of december 31 2008 was 6661 million the increase in our indebtedness may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to fund capital expenditure or working capital needs because we will require additional funds to service our indebtedness 

in addition the senior secured credit agreement contains operating and financial restrictions and requires that we satisfy certain financial covenants the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit agreement a default if not waived could result in acceleration of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing credit facility or it may be on terms that are not acceptable to us 

lehman commercial paper inc is the administrative agent and swing line lender under our credit agreement and had committed to provide 15 million under the revolving credit facility that is part of the credit agreement lehman commercial paper filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code on october 15 2008 accordingly our access to same day borrowing of swing line loans and the 15 million of revolving credit is doubtful we do not believe that an inability to draw on the 15 million revolving credit facility or to access our swing line facility will have a material adverse impact on us however to the extent that other lenders that are part of our credit agreement fail or file for bankruptcy protection our access to funds under our revolving credit facility may be further adversely affected which could harm our ability to do business 

our future capital needs may require that we seek debt financing or additional equity funding that if not available could cause our business to suffer 

we may need to raise additional funds in the future to among other things fund our existing operations improve or expand our operations respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions from time to time we may raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic alliances or other arrangements however the recent turmoil in the credit markets has resulted in severely tighter credit conditions which could affect our ability to raise additional funds until the turmoil subsides if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to further limitations on our operations if we fail to raise capital when needed our business will be negatively affected 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control future factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to those listed in the special note on forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k due to these factors our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate accordingly our results of operations may not be indicative of future performance these fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

fluctuations in the prices of scrap metal and other metals could adversely affect our financial results 

our wholesale recycled oem operations and our selfservice retail recycled oem operations generate scrap metal and other metals that we sell after we dismantle a salvage vehicle for wholesale parts and after vehicles have been used in our selfservice business the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors and other remaining metals are sold to processors and brokers of metals in addition we receive “crush only” vehicles from 

  

other companies including oems which we dismantle and which generate scrap metal and other metals the prices of scrap and other metals have historically fluctuated due to market factors sometimes significantly in addition buyers may stop purchasing metals entirely due to excess supply to the extent the prices of metals decrease materially or buyers stop purchasing metals our revenue from such sales will suffer and a writedown of inventory value could be required the cost of our wholesale recycled oem and our selfservice inventory purchases may also decrease as a result of falling scrap metal and other metals prices but there can be no assurance that our inventory purchasing cost will decrease the same amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal and other metals prices and there may be a delay between the scrap metal and other metals price reductions and any inventory cost reductions our operating results in the fourth quarter of 2008 were adversely affected by the declining scrap metal and other metal prices as described in the results of operations section in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur significant charges to our pretax income 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations in the future goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of future acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed at least annually for impairment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business as of december 31 2008 our total goodwill subject to future impairment testing was approximately 9238 million for further discussion of our annual impairment test see “goodwill impairment” in the critical accounting estimates section of item 7 in this annual report on form 10k 

if the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines our business could suffer 

because our business depends on vehicle accidents for both the supply of recycled oem products and the demand for repairs using our products factors which influence the number andor severity of accidents including but not limited to the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven the ages of drivers the use of cellular telephones and other electronic equipment by drivers the congestion of traffic the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers and the condition of roadways impact our business in this regard a number of states and municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones while driving and such restrictions could lead to a decline in accidents to the extent vehicle manufacturers develop new accident avoidance systems the number and severity of accidents could decrease moreover an increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road to decline as motorists seek alternative transportation options and this also could lead to a decline in accidents 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits 

our operating subsidiaries must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations when we develop or acquire a new facility we must seek the approval of state and local units of government governmental agencies may resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling or refurbishing facility in their communities there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold 

if we lose our key management personnel we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives if we lose 

  

the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel which could harm our business 

we rely on information technology in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business 

we use information technology systems owned by other companies for management of our facilities and our financial functions in the event that the providers of these systems terminate their relationships with us we could suffer disruptions to our operations 

in addition we continually monitor these systems to find areas for improvement in the event that we decided to switch providers or to implement our own systems we may also suffer disruptions to our business we may be unsuccessful in the development of our own systems and we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing our own systems also our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system which period could extend longer than we anticipated 

if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks our business could be harmed 

we use a fleet of trucks to deliver the majority of the products we sell we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in the transportation infrastructure availability and price of fuel liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance and insurance premium increases in addition our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials 

we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials 

under certain environmental laws we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at or migration to or from our or our predecessors’ past or present facilities and at independent waste disposal sites these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or was not responsible for the release of such hazardous substances 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we could be subject to product liability claims 

if customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage we could be subject to product liability claims the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business or financial condition 

  

regulations that may be issued under the anticar theft act could harm our business 

in 1992 congress enacted the anticar theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts in january 2009 the us department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities including automotive parts recyclers like us to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any “covered major part” the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts however if this system is fully implemented the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on vehicle recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may further discourage the use by such shops of recycled products 

risks relating to our common stock 

future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 

we and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock in the future we may also issue shares of common stock under our equity incentive plan or in connection with future acquisitions we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued in connection with an acquisition or the perception that such sales could occur may cause the price of our common stock to fall 

delaware law our charter documents and our loan documents may impede or discourage a takeover which could affect the price of our stock 

the antitakeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws our loan documents and delaware law could together or separately impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult the credit agreement we entered into in connection with our acquisition of keystone provides that a change of control is an event of default our incorporation under delaware law and these provisions could also impede an acquisition takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the price of our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend we are from time to time subject to various claims and lawsuits incidental to our business in the opinion of management currently outstanding claims and suits other than those described below individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

on december 2 2005 ford global technologies llc “ford” filed a complaint under section 337 of the tariff act of 1930 with the united states international trade commission “usitc” against keystone automotive industries inc and five other named respondents including four taiwanbased manufacturers alleging that certain aftermarket parts imported into the united states infringed on 14 design patents that ford alleges cover eight parts on the 20042005 ford f150 truck 

on december 4 2006 an administrative law judge of the usitc preliminarily ruled that seven of the ford design patents were valid and that the importation of automotive parts covered by those seven patents violated section 337 of the tariff act of 1930 on june 6 2007 the usitc affirmed the ruling of the administrative law judge and issued an order prohibiting further importation of automotive parts covered by the patents the usitc’s decision became final on august 6 2007 upon the expiration without action of the 60day presidential review period the parties have appealed the decision to the united states circuit court of appeals for the federal circuit the appeal is pending 

on may 2 2008 ford filed with the usitc another complaint under section 337 of the tariff act of 1930 the complaint alleges that lkq corporation keystone automotive and six other entities collectively the “mustang respondents” import and sell certain automotive parts relating to the 2005 ford mustang that infringe eight ford design patents on may 29 2008 the usitc issued a notice of investigation based on ford’s complaint the usitc’s notice of investigation was published in the federal register on june 5 2008 on june 23 2008 the mustang respondents filed their response to the complaint and notice of investigation in the response the mustang respondents denied among other things that any of the ford design patents is valid andor enforceable and accordingly denied each allegation of infringement the mustang respondents further asserted several affirmative defenses the parties have substantially completed discovery the usitc has set november 2009 as the target date for completion of the investigation 

we will continue to vigorously defend the december 2005 action and the may 2008 action at the time the exclusion order was issued in the december 2005 action the parts that were subject to the order comprised only a minimal amount of our sales similarly the parts that relate to the may 2008 action comprise only a minimal amount of our sales however as such parts become incorporated into more vehicles over time it is likely that the amount of our sales of such parts will increase or would have increased substantially if the design patents in question are ultimately upheld as valid and infringed it is not anticipated that the loss of sales of these parts over time will be materially adverse to our financial position results of operations or cash flows however depending upon the nature and extent of any adverse ruling oems may attempt to assert similar allegations based upon design patents on a significant number of parts for several of their models which over time could have a material adverse impact on us and the entire aftermarket parts industry

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we provide replacement systems components and parts needed to repair vehicles cars and trucks buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily four sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers “oems” which are commonly known as oem products new products produced by companies other than the oems which are sometimes referred to as “aftermarket” products recycled products originally produced by oems which we refer to as recycled oem products and used products that have been refurbished we participate in the market for recycled oem products as well as the market for collision repair aftermarket products we obtain aftermarket products and salvage vehicles from a variety of sources and we dismantle the salvage vehicles to obtain a comprehensive range of vehicle products that we distribute into the vehicle repair market we also refurbish and sell bumpers wheels head lamps and tail lamps 

we are the largest nationwide provider of recycled oem products and related services with sales processing and distribution facilities that reach most major markets in the united states in october 2007 we acquired keystone automotive industries inc the nation’s leading distributor of aftermarket collision parts as a result we are the largest nationwide provider of aftermarket collision replacement products and refurbished bumper covers and wheels we believe there are opportunities for growth in both product lines through acquisitions and internal development 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to those listed in the special note on forwardlooking statements in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k due to these factors our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate accordingly our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance 

acquisitions 

since our inception in 1998 we have pursued a growth strategy of both organic growth and acquisitions we have pursued acquisitions that we believe will help drive profitability cash flow and stockholder value our principal focus for acquisitions is companies that will expand our geographic presence and our ability to provide a wider choice of alternative vehicle replacement products and services to our customers 

during 2006 we acquired ten businesses one in the wheel refurbishing and distribution business two in the aftermarket automotive parts business and seven in the recycled oem automotive parts business for an aggregate of approximately 711 million in cash and 72 million in notes issued to the sellers these business acquisitions enabled us to expand our product offerings to our customers serve new markets and expand our presence in existing markets 

in october 2007 we acquired keystone the nation’s leading distributor of aftermarket collision parts for 8068 million net of cash acquired as a result we are now the largest nationwide provider of aftermarket collision replacement products and refurbished bumpers and wheels during 2007 we also acquired 11 other businesses eight in the recycled oem products business one that refurbishes and distributes head lamps and tail lamps and two in the aftermarket products business these acquisitions included two businesses in canada these business acquisitions enabled us to expand our presence in existing markets serve new market areas and expand our product line offering 

in august 2008 we acquired pickyourpart auto wrecking “pyp” an operator of multiple selfservice facilities in the state of california during 2008 we also acquired seven other businesses three in the recycled oem parts business three in the recycled oem heavy truck parts businesses and one wheel polishing business 

  

these acquisitions included two businesses in canada the 2008 acquisitions enabled us to expand our presence in existing markets increase our coverage of the canadian market and become a provider of recycled oem heavy truck parts 

sources of revenue 

we generate the majority of our revenue from the sale of vehicle replacement products and related services in 2008 sales of vehicle replacement products represented approximately 86 of our consolidated sales we divide our vehicle replacement products into two categories i recycled products and related products and services and ii aftermarket other new and refurbished products recycled products which includes our salvage and selfservice operations was our largest sales category in prior years with the acquisition of keystone the percentage of our revenue derived from the sales of aftermarket other new and refurbished products now exceeds the recycled products category 

we sell the majority of our vehicle replacement products to collision repair shops and mechanical repair shops our vehicle replacement products include engines transmissions frontends doors trunk lids bumpers hoods fenders grilles valances wheels head lamps and tail lamps we sell extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products these contracts cover the cost of parts and labor and are sold for periods of six months one year or two years we defer the revenue from such contracts and recognize it ratably over the term of the contracts the demand for our products and services is influenced by several factors including the number of vehicles in operation the number of miles being driven the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents availability and pricing of new parts seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions additionally automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process accordingly we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our products while they are not our direct customers we do provide insurance carriers services in an effort to promote the increased usage of alternative replacement products in the repair process such services include the review of vehicle repair order estimates as well as direct quotation services to their adjusters we neither charge a fee to the insurance carriers for these services nor adjust our pricing of parts for our customers when we perform these services for insurance carriers there is no standard price for recycled oem products but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as product availability quality demand new oem replacement product prices the age of the vehicle being repaired and competitor pricing the pricing for aftermarket and refurbished products is determined based on a number of factors including availability quality demand new oem replacement product prices and competitor pricing 

in 2008 revenue from other sources represented approximately 14 of our consolidated sales these other sources include bulk sales to mechanical remanufacturers scrap sales and sales of aluminum ingots and sows we derive scrap metal from several sources including oem’s and other companies that contract with us to dismantle and scrap certain vehicles which we refer to as “crush only” vehicles and from vehicles that have been used in both our wholesale and self service recycling operations our revenue from other sources has increased since 2006 in dollar terms but has declined as a percentage of total sales revenue from other sources has grown in recent years due to higher scrap sales from our recycle and wheel operations including crush only vehicles and higher bulk sales of certain products to mechanical remanufacturers 

when we obtain mechanical products from dismantled vehicles and determine they are damaged or when we have a surplus of a certain mechanical product type we sell them in bulk to mechanical remanufacturers the majority of these products are sorted by product type and model type examples of such products are engine blocks and heads transmissions starters alternators and air conditioner compressors after we have recovered all the products we intend to resell the remaining materials are crushed and sold to scrap processors 

cost of goods sold 

our cost of goods sold for recycled oem products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and where applicable auction storage and towing fees we are facing increasing competition in the purchase of 

  

salvage vehicles from shredders and scrap recyclers internetbased buyers and others our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles since 2006 our labor and laborrelated costs related to acquisition and dismantling have accounted for approximately 7 of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle the acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and as a result energy costs are not material 

our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts freight and other inventoried costs such as processing costs incurred in our warehouse locations allocated overhead and import fees and duties where applicable our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors our cost of goods sold for refurbished wheels bumpers and lights includes the price we pay for inventory freight and costs to refurbish the parts including direct and indirect labor rent depreciation and other overhead related to refurbishing operations 

in the event we do not have a recycled oem product or suitable aftermarket product in our inventory to fill a customer order we attempt to purchase the part from a competitor we refer to these parts as brokered products since 2006 the revenue from brokered products that we sell to our customers has ranged from 2 to 5 of our total revenue the gross margin on brokered product sales as a percentage of revenue is generally less than half of what we achieve from sales of our own inventory because we must pay higher prices for these products 

some of our mechanical products are sold with a standard sixmonth warranty against defects we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claim information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses we also sell separately priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products the expense related to extended warranty claims is recognized when the claim is made 

expenses 

our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our distribution selfservice and warehouse facilities these costs include labor for plant management and facility and warehouse personnel stockbased compensation facility rent property and liability insurance utilities and other occupancy costs the costs included in facility and warehouse expenses do not relate to inventory processing or conversion activities and as such are classified below the gross margin line on our consolidated statements of income 

our distribution expenses primarily include our costs to deliver our products to our customers included in our distribution expense category are labor costs for drivers local delivery and transfer truck rentals and subcontractor costs vehicle repairs and maintenance insurance and fuel 

our selling and marketing expenses primarily include our advertising promotion and marketing costs salary and commission expenses for sales personnel sales training telephone and other communication expenses and bad debt expense since 2006 personnel costs have accounted for approximately 80 of our selling and marketing expenses most of our product sales personnel are paid on a commission basis the number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our customers’ needs and increase our sales volume our objective is to continually evaluate our sales force develop and implement training programs and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness 

our general and administrative expenses include primarily the costs of our corporate and regional offices that provide corporate and field management treasury accounting legal payroll business development human resources and information systems functions these costs include wages and benefits for corporate regional and administrative personnel stockbased compensation long term incentive compensation accounting legal and other professional fees office supplies telephone and other communication costs insurance and rent 

  

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather related accidents in addition the cost of salvage vehicles tends to be lower as more weather related accidents occur generating a larger supply of total loss vehicles 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition inventory valuation allowance for doubtful accounts goodwill impairment selfinsurance programs contingencies accounting for income taxes and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue actual results may differ from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize and report revenue from the sale of vehicle replacement products when they are shipped and title has transferred subject to a reserve for returns discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information a replacement product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment our customers may earn discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment we analyze historical returns and allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates we use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold if actual returns and allowances are higher than our historical experience there would be an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence 

we also sell separately priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products revenue from these contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the contracts 

inventory accounting 

salvage inventory salvage inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle and includes buying dismantling and where applicable auction storage and towing fees inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facility’s inventory at expected selling prices the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility’s historical vehicle profitability for salvage vehicles purchased at auction or from contracted rates for salvage vehicles acquired under direct procurement arrangements 

aftermarket and refurbished product inventory aftermarket and refurbished product inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market our aftermarket inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for parts and includes expenses incurred for freight and buying where applicable for items purchased from foreign sources import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included our refurbished product inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for wheel and bumper cores and includes expenses incurred for freight buying and refurbishing overhead 

  

for all inventory our carrying value is reduced regularly to reflect the age and current anticipated demand for our products if actual demand differs from our estimates additional reductions to our inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts the aging of the accounts receivable and our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts at december 31 2008 was approximately 58 million which represents 36 of gross receivables if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts may be insufficient to cover the uncollectible receivables which would have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence a 10 change in the 2008 annual writeoff rate would result in a change in the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately 06 million for our vehicle replacement parts operations our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable is generally limited because the majority of our sales are to a large number of small customers that are geographically dispersed we also have certain customers in our vehicle replacement parts operations that pay for products at the time of delivery the aluminum smelter and our mechanical core operation sell in larger quantities to a small number of distributors foundry customers and remanufacturers as a result our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable is greater in these operations we control credit risk through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring policies

we record goodwill as a result of our acquisitions statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” requires us to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually the determination of the value of goodwill requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events may indicate that an impairment exists in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill 

during the third quarter of 2008 we commenced a reorganization of our vehicle replacement products operations into 11 operating segments combining our wholesale recycled oem products and aftermarket products on a geographic basis with a separate operating segment for our selfservice retail oem products and one for our recycled heavy truck parts operations we utilize these 11 operating segments as reporting units without aggregation for purposes of goodwill impairment testing given the changes to our reporting units we conducted impairment tests for each unit as of our annual testing date 

our goodwill would be considered impaired if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value the fair value estimates are established using an equal weighting of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach we believe that using two methods to determine fair value limits the chances of an unrepresentative valuation as of december 31 2008 we had 9238 million in goodwill subject to future impairment tests if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results we determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarters of 2008 2007 and 2006 furthermore the sum of the fair values of each of our reporting units was less than our market capitalization at both the annual testing date as well as december 31 2008 a 10 decrease in the fair value estimates of the reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2008 impairment test would have changed this 

  

determination for one reporting unit our selfservice reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its book value by 6 in prior years the fair value of the selfservice reporting unit has exceeded the carrying value by larger amounts however a combination of factors including the decline in scrap metal and other metal prices in the fourth quarter of 2008 and our acquisition of pickyourpart auto wrecking “pyp” self service yards shortly before this drop in prices contributed to the narrowing gap between fair value and book value we could be subject to an impairment in the selfservice reporting unit which has 1015 million in goodwill as of december 31 2008 in future periods if the market conditions worsen or the economic slowdown extends into 2010 or later 

selfinsurance programs 

we selfinsure a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program we purchase certain stoploss insurance to limit our liability exposure we also selfinsure a portion of our property and casualty risk which includes automobile liability general liability workers’ compensation and property under deductible insurance programs the insurance premium costs are expensed over the contract periods 

we record an accrual for the claims expense related to our employee medical benefits automobile liability general liability and workers’ compensation claims the reserve for liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported based upon our estimate of ultimate cost which is calculated using analyses of historical data we monitor new claims and claim development as well as trends related to the claims incurred but not reported in order to assess the adequacy of our insurance reserves our insurance reserves totaled approximately 262 million net of claims deposits of 08 million at december 31 2008 while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our insurance reserves and corresponding expenses could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and assumptions 

contingencies 

we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business resulting from litigation claims and other commitments and from a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies we accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we determine the amount of reserves if any with the assistance of our outside legal counsel we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether the accruals should be adjusted if the amount of an actual loss were greater than the amount we have accrued the excess loss would have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period that the loss occurred if the loss contingency is subsequently determined to no longer be probable the amount of loss contingency previously accrued would be included in our operating results in the period such determination was made 

accounting for income taxes 

all income tax amounts reflect the use of the liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions with different tax rates and we determine the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based upon various estimates and assumptions 

we record a provision for taxes based upon our effective income tax rate we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we expect is more likely than not to be realized we consider historical taxable income expectations and risks associated with our estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we had a valuation allowance of 09 million 07 million and 09 million at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively against our 

  

deferred tax assets should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made conversely should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made 

we adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” effective january 1 2007 fin 48 establishes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns only those positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold may be recognized in the financial statements we recognize interest accrued relating to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax expense as a result of the implementation of fin 48 we recorded a 04 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits an increase in deferred tax assets of 01 million and a decrease of 03 million in the january 1 2007 retained earnings balance prior to 2007 we recorded accruals for tax contingencies and related interest when it was determined that it was probable that we had incurred a liability and the amount could reasonably be estimated based on specific events such as an audit by a taxing authority in the normal course of business we will undergo tax audits by various tax jurisdictions such audits often require an extended period of time to complete and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates under existing gaap changes in accruals for uncertainties arising from the resolution of preacquisition contingencies of acquired businesses are charged or credited to goodwill adjustments to other tax accruals we make are generally recognized in the period they are determined under statement of financial accounting standards no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas 141r” changes in accruals for uncertainties arising from the resolution of preacquisition contingencies and income taxes of acquired businesses will be recorded in earnings in the period the changes are determined after the effective date of sfas 141r see “recently issued accounting pronouncements” and note 12 “income taxes” in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for all sharebased payments including employee stock options at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all awards on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award in accordance with sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” 

several key factors and assumptions affect the valuation models currently utilized for valuing our stock option awards under sfas 123r we have been in existence since early 1998 and have been a public company since october 2003 as a result we do not have the historical data necessary to consider using a lattice valuation model at this time we have therefore elected to use the blackscholes valuation model in december 2007 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin 110 “sab 110” to amend the sec’s views discussed in staff accounting bulletin 107 “sab 107” regarding the use of the simplified method in developing an estimate of expected life of share options in accordance with sfas no 123r we will continue to use the simplified method until we have the historical data necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of expected life in accordance with sab 107 as amended by sab 110 for expected term we have what sab 107 defines as “plainvanilla” stock options and therefore used a simple average of the vesting period and the contractual term for options granted subsequent to january 1 2006 as permitted by sab 107 volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of the option for volatility we considered our own volatility for the limited time we have been a public company as well as the disclosed volatilities of companies that are considered comparable to us our forfeiture assumption is based on historical forfeiture rates both preipo and since we have been a public company sfas 123r requires that forfeitures be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the dividend yield represents the dividend rate expected to be paid over the option’s expected term and we currently have no plans to pay dividends the riskfree interest rate is based on zerocoupon us government issues available at the time each option is granted that have a remaining life approximately equal to the option’s expected life key 

  

weightedaverage assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock options granted in 2008 were expected term of 64 years riskfree interest rate of 327 dividend yield of 0 forfeiture rate of 67 and volatility of 394 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

effective january 1 2008 we adopted sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” as it pertains to financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the provisions of fasb staff position “fsp” 1572 we elected to defer the adoption of sfas 157 relating to the fair value of nonfinancial assets and liabilities we are currently evaluating the impact if any of applying sfas 157 to our nonfinancial assets and liabilities sfas 157 established a framework for reporting fair value and expands disclosures required for fair value measurements although the adoption of sfas 157 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we are now required to provide additional disclosures as part of our financial statements these additional disclosures are provided in note 15 “fair value measurements” in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas 141r” under sfas 141r companies will be required to among other things recognize the assets acquired liabilities assumed including contractual contingencies and contingent consideration at fair value on the date of acquisition sfas 141r also requires that acquisitionrelated expenses be expensed as incurred restructuring costs be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in accounting for deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period be expensed in income tax expense we adopted sfas 141r on january 1 2009 and will apply it to business combinations prospectively 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities—an amendment of sfas no 133” “sfas 161” sfas 161 requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 with early application encouraged the disclosure provisions of sfas 161 are effective as of the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year as sfas 161 specifically relates to disclosures regarding derivative and hedging activities it will not impact our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in april 2008 the fasb issued fsp no 1423 “determination of the useful life of intangible assets” fsp no 1423 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” fsp no 1423 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 the adoption of fsp no 1423 on january 1 2009 did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 

segment reporting 

over 96 of our operations are conducted in the united states during 2004 we acquired a recycled oem products business with locations in guatemala and costa rica in 2007 and 2008 we acquired a total of four recycled oem products businesses located in canada keystone which we acquired in october 2007 has bumper refurbishing operations in mexico and aftermarket products businesses located in canada revenue generated and properties located outside of the united states are not material 

during the third quarter of 2008 we commenced a reorganization of our vehicle replacement products operations into 11 operating segments combining our wholesale recycled oem products and aftermarket products on a geographic basis with a separate operating segment for our selfservice retail oem products and one for our recycled heavy truck parts operations these segments are aggregated into one reportable segment 

  

because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services customers and methods of distribution the vehicle replacement products operations account for over 95 of our revenue earnings and assets 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth statement of income data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated 

 

 year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

revenue our revenue increased 719 from 11268 million in 2007 to 19373 million in 2008 the increase in revenue was primarily due to the higher volume of products we sold and business acquisitions in particular the keystone acquisition we also processed a higher volume of vehicles in 2008 which resulted in higher revenue from processing fees and from the sale of scrap and other commodities derived from the dismantling process average scrap metal and other metal prices increased over the prior year but prices decreased in the latter part of 2008 since the october 2007 acquisition of keystone we have been integrating the sale and distribution of our preexisting aftermarket wheel and reconditioned light product offerings with keystone and with our recycled parts operations in order to provide a wider selection of products to our customers from all distribution points organic revenue growth was approximately 88 in 2008 and was calculated assuming we had owned keystone for all of 2007 the integration of our preexisting aftermarket and wheel operations with keystone prevents us from measuring revenue growth between keystone and our preexisting businesses since the acquisition 

cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased 740 from 6211 million in 2007 to 10806 million in 2008 the increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to increased volume of products sold as a percentage of revenue cost of goods sold increased from 551 to 558 our cost of goods sold percentage increased primarily due to lower gross margins at our self service facilities in the latter part of the year the ferrous and nonferrous metals markets for scrap declined significantly in that time and our margins at the self service facilities suffered as we were forced to sell at lower prices than anticipated when we had acquired the product while we have adjusted our purchasing to take into account the lower sales pricing for vehicles in our self service retail operations it normally takes several months to fully adjust our buying costs and our margins have been hurt as a result the vehicles we purchase for the self service operations are typically much older and the revenue from scrap is a higher percentage of sales than in our wholesale salvage operation additionally we experienced a difficult buying environment for our self service operations in the fourth quarter which limited our purchases as sellers either held vehicles in anticipation of improving conditions or demanded prices above our assessment of the current market value 

  

gross margin our gross margin increased 694 from 5057 million in 2007 to 8567 million in 2008 our gross margin increased primarily due to increased volume as a percentage of revenue gross margin decreased from 449 to 442 our gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased due primarily to the factors noted above in cost of goods sold 

facility and warehouse expenses facility and warehouse expenses increased 610 from 1166 million in 2007 to 1876 million in 2008 our facility and warehouse expenses increased primarily due to 345 million in higher wages and fringe benefits resulting from increased headcount for field personnel 208 million for higher facility rents taxes and utilities 46 million of higher repairs and maintenance and 29 million of higher supplies expense our acquisition of keystone accounted for a majority of the increase while our acquisition of pyp in august 2008 contributed 113 million to the increase as a percentage of revenue facility and warehouse expenses decreased from 103 to 97 primarily due to better expense leverage on increased revenue 

distribution expenses distribution expenses increased 664 from 1082 million in 2007 to 1801 million in 2008 our distribution expenses increased primarily due to 337 million of higher wage and benefit costs from an increase in the number of employees higher fuel costs of 157 million higher truck rentals and repairs of 96 million and higher third party freight of 97 million our acquisition of keystone accounted for the majority of the increases as a percentage of revenue distribution expenses decreased from 96 to 93 primarily due to better expense leverage on increased revenue 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 789 from 1408 million in 2007 to 2520 million in 2008 the majority of the expense increase was a result of an increase in labor and laborrelated expenses of 741 million due primarily to higher sales commission expenses and increased headcount our selling expenses tend to rise as revenue increases due to our commissioned sales forces our remaining selling general and administrative expenses increased due primarily to higher professional fees of 88 million higher telephone expense of 54 million higher bad debt expense of 44 million higher advertising and promotion of 50 million and higher employee travel expenses of 39 million our acquisition of keystone accounted for a majority of the increases as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses increased from 125 to 130 aftermarket products which became a larger portion of our business with the keystone acquisition have higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than our recycled products 

restructuring expenses restructuring expenses increased from 04 million in 2007 to 86 million in 2008 restructuring expenses include facility and personnel relocation costs severance and lease termination costs that we incurred when we combined some of our existing facilities into keystone facilities we completed the acquisition of keystone on october 12 2007 as of december 31 2008 we have completed the majority of our facility and systems conversions we currently anticipate the combination of operations and migration of systems will be substantially completed during the second quarter of 2009 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased 795 from 171 million in 2007 to 307 million in 2008 our acquisition of keystone accounted for the majority of the increase in depreciation and amortization expense including 30 million of higher amortization for the keystone trade name as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization increased from 15 in 2007 to 16 in 2008 

operating income operating income increased 612 from 1227 million in 2007 to 1977 million in 2008 as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased from 109 to 102 

other income expense net other expense increased 1371 from 144 million in 2007 to 341 million in 2008 net interest expense increased 1219 to 355 million in 2008 from 160 million in 2007 our average bank borrowings increased approximately 4105 million during 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to the keystone acquisition we had 09 million of proceeds from corporate owned life insurance in 2007 we use 

  

corporate owned life insurance policies to fund our obligations under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan as a percentage of revenue net other expense increased from 13 in 2007 to 18 in 2008 due primarily to higher interest expense 

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased 503 from 424 million in 2007 to 637 million in 2008 due primarily to improved operating results our effective tax rate was 389 in 2008 and 391 in 2007 we experienced an increase in our effective state tax rate of 04 compared to the prior year as a result of the keystone acquisition which affected the apportionment of our state income towards higher rate jurisdictions discrete items decreased the effective rate in 2008 as opposed to increasing the effective rate in 2007 in 2008 we identified several state tax credits for which we were eligible and recognized a tax benefit of approximately 12 million in our income tax provision for 2008 provisions for uncertain tax positions increased relative to the prior year primarily as a result of keystone tax reserves in 2007 we reduced certain deferred tax assets and net income by 06 million due to a change in a state’s income tax law where we have operations which increased our effective rate by 05 this effect was partially offset by the benefit from 09 million of nontaxable life insurance proceeds from corporate owned life insurance 

year ended december 31 2007 compared to year ended december 31 2006 

revenue our revenue increased 427 from 7894 million in 2006 to 11268 million in 2007 the increase in revenue was primarily due to the higher volume of products we sold and business acquisitions organic revenue growth was approximately 124 in 2007 we continued to expand our services to the insured repair industry and added local delivery routes and transfer routes that helped us to increase our market penetration we also continued to integrate the sale and distribution of our aftermarket wheel and refurbished light vehicle replacement product offerings with our recycled oem products in more locations in order to provide a wider selection of products to our customers business acquisitions completed in 2007 including keystone since the closing of that transaction on october 12 2007 and the full year impact of our 2006 acquisitions accounted for approximately 2396 million of incremental revenue for the year 

cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased 438 from 4318 million in 2006 to 6211 million in 2007 as a percentage of revenue cost of goods sold increased from 547 to 551 the increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to increased volume of products sold our cost of goods sold percentage increased primarily due to the lower gross margin of our aluminum smelter and purchase accounting inventory adjustments as described below relating to sfas 141 this smelter had revenue of 384 million at a gross margin of 48 in 2007 compared to 282 million at a gross margin of 71 during 2006 we were also required to writeup the value of keystone’s finished goods and work in process inventories for refurbished products in accordance with sfas 141 as a result we recorded an additional 18 million in cost of goods sold for the period we owned keystone in 2007 we will record an additional 11 million of cost of goods sold in the first quarter of 2008 related to this sfas 141 writeup 

gross margin our gross margin increased 414 from 3575 million in 2006 to 5057 million in 2007 our gross margin increased primarily due to increased volume as a percentage of revenue gross margin decreased from 453 to 449 our gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased due primarily to the factors noted above in cost of goods sold 

facility and warehouse expenses facility and warehouse expenses increased 351 from 863 million in 2006 to 1166 million in 2007 our acquisitions accounted for 240 million of the increase our remaining facility and warehouse expenses increased primarily due to 44 million of higher wages and fringe benefits resulting from an increase in the number of employees necessary to handle higher parts volume the balance of the increase is primarily related to the higher cost of rent repairs and maintenance and supplies as a percentage of revenue facility and warehouse expenses decreased from 109 to 103 primarily due to expense leverage on increased revenue 

  

distribution expenses distribution expenses increased 351 from 801 million in 2006 to 1082 million in 2007 our acquisitions accounted for 203 million of the increase our remaining distribution expenses increased primarily due to 41 million of higher wages and fringe benefits from an increase in the number of employees to handle higher parts volumes increased fuel costs of 18 million and higher freight repairs and rental costs as a percentage of revenue distribution expenses decreased from 101 to 96 primarily due to expense leverage on increased revenue 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 378 from 1022 million in 2006 to 1408 million in 2007 our acquisitions accounted for 327 million of the increase the remaining increase in our selling general and administrative expenses is due to higher compensation and fringe benefits costs as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses decreased from 129 to 125 primarily due to expense leverage on increased revenue 

restructuring expenses restructuring expenses totaled 04 million in 2007 restructuring expenses include severance and lease termination costs that we incurred when we combined some of our existing facilities into keystone facilities 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased 446 from 118 million in 2006 to 171 million in 2007 our acquisitions accounted for 36 million of the increase in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization was 15 in both 2006 and 2007 

operating income operating income increased 590 from 772 million in 2006 to 1227 million in 2007 as a percentage of revenue operating income increased from 98 to 109 

other income expense net other expense increased 2311 from 43 million in 2006 to 144 million in 2007 net interest expense increased 1749 to 160 million in 2007 from 58 million in 2006 our average bank borrowings increased approximately 1523 million during 2007 as compared to 2006 due primarily to the keystone acquisition in addition our average effective interest rate on our bank debt also increased in 2007 we had 09 million of proceeds from corporate owned life insurance in 2007 we use corporate owned life insurance policies to fund our obligations under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan included in other income in 2006 is a gain of 07 million on the sale of equity securities as a percentage of revenue net other expense increased from 06 in 2006 to 13 in 2007 due primarily to higher interest expense 

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased 491 from 284 million in 2006 to 424 million in 2007 due primarily to improved operating results our effective tax rate was 391 in 2007 and 390 in 2006 our effective tax rate in 2007 was impacted by several items we had 09 million of nontaxable life insurance proceeds from corporate owned life insurance in addition we reduced certain deferred tax assets and net income by 06 million due to a change in a state’s income tax law where we have operations we also were able to utilize certain state tax net operating loss carry forwards that we did not expect would be realized and adjusted tax reserves due to the statutory closing of certain tax years without all of these adjustments the effective tax rate would have been 400 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of ongoing liquidity are cash flow from our operations and our credit facility at december 31 2008 we had 791 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately 714 available under our bank credit agreement 115 million commitment less outstanding revolver borrowings of 53 million and letters of credit of 232 million and excluding a 15 million commitment from lehman commercial paper inc “lcp” that is unlikely to be honored as described below on september 25 2007 we completed a public offering of 276 million shares of our common stock with 236 million shares sold by us and 40 million shares sold by certain selling stockholders we received approximately 3495 million in net proceeds from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses of the offering we paid all amounts outstanding under our 

  

revolving credit facility at that time and temporarily invested the remaining proceeds in cash equivalents until we used the proceeds to acquire keystone on october 12 2007 

we obtained a senior secured debt financing facility “credit agreement” from lehman brothers inc “lehman” and deutsche bank securities inc “deutsche bank” on october 12 2007 which was amended on october 26 2007 the credit agreement has a six year term and includes a 610 million term loan a 40 million canadian currency term loan a 100 million us dollar revolving credit facility and a 15 million dual currency facility for drawings of either us dollars or canadian dollars the credit agreement also provides for i the issuance of letters of credit of up to 35 million in us dollars and up to 10 million in either us or canadian dollars ii for a swing line credit facility of 25 million under the 100 million revolving credit facility and iii the opportunity for us to add additional term loan facilities andor increase the 100 million revolving credit facility’s commitments provided that such additions or increases do not exceed 150 million in the aggregate and provided further that no existing lender is required to make its pro rata share of any such additions or increases without its consent amounts under each term loan facility are due and payable in quarterly installments of increasing amounts that began in the first quarter of 2008 with the balance payable in full on october 12 2013 amounts due under each revolving credit facility will be due and payable on october 12 2013 we are also required to prepay the term loan facilities upon the sale of certain assets upon the incurrence of certain debt upon receipt of certain insurance and condemnation proceeds and with up to 50 of our excess cash flow with the amount of such excess cash flow determined based upon our total leverage ratio 

lcp filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york on october 5 2008 lcp is the administrative agent under our credit agreement and had committed to provide 15 million under the revolving credit facility that is a part of our credit agreement our ability to draw on that 15 million is doubtful as a result of the bankruptcy filing lcp is also our swing line lender and in such capacity had committed to provide same day borrowing of swing line loans as part of our revolving credit facility we have not borrowed any amounts under any swing line loans our ability to access this short term borrowing is doubtful as a result of the bankruptcy filing however we do not believe that any inability to draw on the 15 million revolving credit facility or to access our swing line facility will have a material adverse impact on us 

the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties and contains customary covenants that restrict our ability to among other things i incur liens ii incur any indebtedness including guarantees or other contingent obligations and iii engage in mergers and consolidations the credit agreement also requires us to meet certain financial covenants including compliance with the required senior secured debt ratio we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants as of december 31 2008 

borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at variable rates which depend on the type us dollar or canadian dollar and duration of the borrowing plus an applicable margin rate the weightedaverage interest rates on borrowings outstanding against our senior secured credit facility at december 31 2008 after giving effect to the interest rate swap contracts in force described in note 5 “longterm obligations” in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k and 2007 were 462 and 753 respectively before debt issuance cost amortization borrowings against the senior secured credit facility totaled 6383 million and 6503 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively of which 198 million and 100 million are classified as current maturities respectively 

our liquidity needs are primarily to fund working capital requirements and expand our facilities and network the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under some direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles we normally pay for aftermarket parts purchases at the time of shipment or on standard payment terms depending on the manufacturer and payment options offered wheel cores acquired from third parties are normally paid for on standard payment terms we acquired approximately 144500 126000 and 111400 wholesale salvage vehicles in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively in addition we acquired 

  

approximately 297000 197500 and 138700 lower cost selfservice and crush only vehicles in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our purchases of aftermarket parts and wheels totaled approximately 4904 million 1901 million and 945 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively with the increase principally due to our acquisition of keystone 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 1330 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 544 million for the same period of 2007 net income adjusted for noncash depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation generated 1412 million of cash in 2008 a 538 million increase over the same period of 2007 working capital uses of cash net of effects of purchase acquisitions included increases in receivables and decreases in accounts payable and other accrued expenses receivables increased primarily due to a growth in revenue accounts payable decreased primarily due to accelerating some of keystone’s vendor payments in order to take advantage of discounts offered for earlier payment inventory net of effects of purchase acquisitions generated a cash inflow of 42 million for 2008 compared to a 351 million outflow in the prior year the reduction in the inventory balance is attributable to a decline in aftermarket inventory resulting from the consolidation of lkq’s former aftermarket operations with keystone’s additionally we experienced a difficult buying environment for our self service operations in the fourth quarter which limited our purchases as sellers either held vehicles in anticipation of improving conditions or demanded prices above our assessment of the current market value 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1389 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 9058 million for the same period of 2007 we invested 742 million of cash in eight acquisitions in 2008 compared to 8680 million for 12 acquisitions in the comparable period of 2007 including the acquisition of keystone for cash consideration of approximately 807 million net property and equipment and other long term asset purchases increased 269 million in 2008 which is partially attributable to a full year of capital spending for keystone compared to less than three months in 2007 additionally we continued spending to expand our salvage facilities and develop our operating systems 

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 118 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 9216 million for the same period of 2007 which resulted primarily from the term loan borrowings in october 2007 and the sale of common stock in september 2007 exercises of stock options provided 104 million and 121 million in the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the excess tax benefit from sharebased payment arrangements reduced income taxes payable by 125 million and 193 million in the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively net repayments of longterm debt obligations and line of credit borrowings totaled 109 million in 2008 while net borrowings were 5547 million in 2007 primarily resulting from term loan borrowings of 6510 million for the keystone acquisition 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 544 million in 2007 compared to 524 million in 2006 cash was provided by net income adjusted for noncash items working capital uses of cash included increases in receivables and inventory partially offset by increases in payables accruals income taxes and other noncurrent liabilities receivables increased primarily due to our increased sales volumes inventory increased to support our increased sales volume and to increase availability of our recycled oem products accounts payable and accrued expenses increased primarily due to our increased volume and restructuring costs income taxes before considering the excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options increased due to the timing of tax payments other noncurrent liabilities increased primarily due to increases in our long term incentive plan and deferred compensation liabilities 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 9058 million in 2007 compared to 1107 million in 2006 we used 8680 million of cash for acquisitions in 2007 with 8068 million used for the keystone acquisition compared to 735 million used for acquisitions in 2006 our net property and equipment purchases increased 19 million in 2007 in 2006 we repaid 26 million from escrow liabilities related to a 2004 acquisition 

  

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 9216 million in 2007 compared to 591 million in 2006 as described below we received 3495 million from the sale of 236 million shares of our common stock in a public offering in 2007 we also borrowed 6510 million under our term loan to finance the keystone acquisition in 2007 exercises of stock options totaled 121 million in 2007 compared to 55 million in 2006 while the excess tax benefit from such option exercises was 193 million in 2007 and 71 million in 2006 we exercised a call option and retired 11 million of redeemable common stock in 2007 in connection with our debt refinancing we paid 128 million in debt issuance costs in 2007 we repaid 882 million in 2007 under our previous revolving credit facility compared to net borrowings of 480 million in 2006 repayments of longterm obligations increased 59 million in 2007 

as part of the consideration for business acquisitions completed during 2008 2007 and 2006 we issued promissory notes totaling approximately 16 million 17 million and 72 million respectively the notes bear interest at annual rates of 35 to 60 and interest is payable at maturity or in monthly installments 

we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of redistribution centers processing facilities and warehouses through further integration of aftermarket refurbished and recycled oem product facilities and through selected business acquisitions our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions 

we estimate that our capital expenditures for 2009 excluding business acquisitions will be between 750 and 800 million we expect to use these funds for several major facility expansions improvement of current facilities real estate acquisitions and systems development projects we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities for 2009 will be in excess of 1450 million 

we believe that our current cash and equivalents cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements however we may from time to time raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements there can be no assurance that additional funding or refinancing of our credit facility if needed will be available on terms attractive to us or at all furthermore any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

offbalance sheet arrangements and future commitments 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to item 303 of regulation sk under the securities exchange act of 1934 additionally we do not have any synthetic leases 

  

the following table represents our future commitments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 

 

 our longterm debt under contractual obligations above includes interest on the balance outstanding under our variable rate credit facility as of december 31 2008 the long term debt outstanding at december 31 2008 in the above table includes interest computed at the average effective rate of 462 at december 31 2008

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facility where interest rates are tied to either the prime rate or libor in march 2008 we implemented a policy to manage our exposure to variable interest rates on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt instruments through the use of interest rate swap contracts these contracts convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate matching effective and maturity dates to specific debt instruments all of our interest rate swap contracts have been executed with banks jp morgan chase bank na and deutsche bank ag that we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currency that matches the underlying debt instrument net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swap contracts will be included as adjustments to interest expense in our consolidated income statement as of december 31 2008 three interest rate swap contracts representing a total of 500 million of notional amount were outstanding with various maturity dates through april 2011 all of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and modify the variable rate nature of that portion of our variable rate debt the fair market value of our outstanding interest rate swap contracts at december 31 2008 was a liability of approximately 145 million and the value of such contracts is subject to changes in interest rates 

at december 31 2008 we had unhedged variable rate debt of 1383 million using sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of a 100 basis point movement in the interest rate interest expense would change by 14 million annually 

we are also exposed to market risk related to price fluctuations in scrap metal and other metals market prices of these metals affect the amount that we pay for our inventory as well as the revenue that we generate from sales of these metals as both our revenue and costs are affected by the price fluctuations we have a natural hedge against the changes however there is typically a lag between the metal price fluctuations which influence our revenue and any inventory cost changes therefore we can experience positive or negative margin effects in periods of rising or falling metal prices particularly when such prices move rapidly scrap metal and other metal prices declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 which had a negative effect on our revenue and margins this trend will continue until inventory costs decrease by an amount commensurate with the decline of scrap metal and other metal prices 

additionally we are exposed to currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket parts in taiwan while all transactions with manufacturers based in taiwan are conducted in us dollars changes in the relationship between the us dollar and the taiwan dollar might impact the purchase price of aftermarket parts we might not be able to pass on any price increases to customers under our present policies we do not attempt to hedge this currency exchange rate exposure 

our investment in our operations in central america and canada is not material and we do not attempt to hedge our foreign currency risk related to such operations

overview 

we provide replacement systems components and parts needed to repair light vehicles cars and light trucks buyers of light vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily three sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers “oems” which are commonly known as oem products new products produced by companies other than the oems which are sometimes referred to generically as “aftermarket” products and recycled products originally produced by oems which we refer to as recycled oem products we participate in the market for recycled oem products as well as the market for collision repair aftermarket products we obtain aftermarket products and salvage vehicles from a variety of sources and we dismantle the salvage vehicles to obtain a comprehensive range of vehicle products that we distribute into the light vehicle repair market we recently entered the business of refurbishing and distributing aluminum alloy wheels head lamps and tail lamps we are not involved in the manufacture of automotive products and do not maintain any manufacturing or remanufacturing operations 

we believe we are the largest nationwide provider of recycled oem products and related services with sales processing and distribution facilities that reach most major markets in the us we believe that we are the second largest nationwide provider of aftermarket collision replacement products and refurbished wheels we believe there are opportunities for growth in both product lines through acquisitions and internal development 

we procure salvage vehicles primarily at auctions using our locally based professionals proprietary processes and a disciplined procurement system in addition as an alternative source of salvage vehicles we obtain some inventory directly from insurance companies vehicle manufacturers and other suppliers once we have received proper title which assures us that the vehicles have not been stolen we dismantle such vehicles for recycled oem products we purchase aftermarket products from manufacturers primarily in taiwan using a proprietary order management system 

our customers include collision and mechanical repair shops and indirectly insurance companies including extended warranty companies the majority of our products and services are sold to collision repair shops also known as body shops and mechanical repair shops we indirectly rely on insurance companies which ultimately pay the collision repair shops for the repair of insured vehicles as a source of business these insurance companies exert significant influence in the vehicle repair decision and increasingly look to a nationwide source for consistency quality and availability of replacement products because of their importance to the process we have formed business relationships with certain insurance 

companies and with certain extended warranty providers in order to be their preferred light vehicle parts supplier for example with some insurance companies we have vehicle repair order estimate review programs in place and provide their claims adjusters a part quote and locator service in addition we provide them an outlet to dispose of certain total loss vehicles directly to us we provide extended warranty companies a single national call desk to service their nationwide needs for mechanical products 

we believe we provide customers a value proposition that includes high quality products extensive product availability due to our regional inventory trading zones product costs lower than new oem products and quick delivery we provide benefits to repair shops and insurance companies because the lower costs for our products enable many vehicles to be repaired rather than declared a total loss by expanding our product offerings to include both recycled oem products and aftermarket products we now offer customers a more extensive range of light vehicle replacement products we believe this unique combination of recycled aftermarket and refurbished product offerings allows us to serve as a “onestop” solution for our customers looking for the most cost advantageous way to repair vehicles 

we believe that our business is environmentally responsible our recycled automotive products provide an alternative to the manufacture of new products which would require the expenditure of significantly more resources and energy and would generate a substantial amount of additional pollution also we recycle materials such as fuel motor oil and freon from the salvage vehicles that we procure 

our history 

we believe we were the first recycler of light vehicle products to achieve a national network and presence since our formation in 1998 we have grown through both internal development and acquisitions our acquisition strategy has been to target companies with strategic locations and significant market presence strong management teams a record of environmental compliance solid growth prospects and a reputation for quality and customer service we currently have 67 locations in the us that supply wholesale recycled oem products in february 2004 we expanded our product offerings by also becoming a supplier of aftermarket products and a provider of selfservice retail recycled vehicle products we currently have approximately 48 locations that supply aftermarket products 20 of which are colocated at wholesale recycle facilities we have 22   locations providing selfservice retail recycled vehicle products we also operate out of three locations in central america on january 31 2006 we acquired an aluminum alloy wheel refurbishing and distribution business our wheel subsidiary currently operates six refurbishing and distribution facilities one of which is colocated at an aftermarket facility on january 1 2007 we acquired a head and tail lamp refurbishing company 

for the year ended december 31 2006 revenue derived from recycled oem products and related services represented approximately 598 of our revenue sales of aftermarket and refurbished products and services represented approximately 244 of our revenue and sales of other products such as scrap and other bulk products represented approximately 158 of our revenue 

our strengths 

we provide a national solution to insurance companies and extended warranty providers 

we believe that our nationwide presence gives us a unique ability to service the major automobile insurance companies and extended warranty providers insurance companies and extended warranty providers operate generally at a national or regional level and play a critical role in the repair process we believe we provide a direct benefit to these companies by lowering the cost of repairs decreasing the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and providing a replacement product that is of comparable quality to the part replaced specifically we assist insurance companies by purchasing insured total loss vehicles and by providing cost effective products through sales to collision repair shops especially 

to repair shops that are part of an insurance company network we also provide a review of vehicle repair order estimates to insurance companies so they may assess the opportunity to increase usage of recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished products for extended warranty providers we provide a single national call desk to service their nationwide need for mechanical products 

we believe we have the only national network for recycled oem products and it would be difficult to replicate 

we have invested significant capital developing a national network of recycled oem product facilities that serves most major metropolitan areas in the us we have differentiated ourselves from our local competitors and made replication of our network difficult by developing our network through purchasing anchor companies that were among the largest companies in the industry the difficulty and time required to obtain proper zoning as well as dismantling and other environmental permits necessary to operate newlysited facilities would make establishing new facilities challenging in addition there are difficulties associated with recruiting and hiring an experienced management team that has strong industry knowledge and local relationships with customers finally our national network allows us to enter new adjacent markets quickly by establishing redistribution facilities which avoids the need for local dismantling capabilities and inventory 

we benefit from a local presence 

our network of facilities allows us to develop and maintain our relationships with local repair shops while providing a level of service to insurance companies and national customers that is made possible by our nationwide presence our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries that our customers require using drivers who routinely deliver to the same customers our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network 

we have a proven and effective procurement process 

we have designed information systems and methodologies to procure salvage vehicles and aftermarket products costeffectively as our largest single expenditure efficient procurement of salvage vehicles is critical to the growth operating results and cash flow of our business our processes and knowhow allow us to identify and value the parts that can be recycled on a damaged vehicle at auction and to determine rapidly the maximum price we will pay for the vehicle in order to achieve our target margins on resale of the recycled oem products we carefully analyze the market and obtain aftermarket products and salvage vehicles of the type whose parts are in demand at prices that we believe will allow us to sell products profitably we have also taken advantage of our relationships with insurance companies and vehicle manufacturers to obtain salvage vehicles outside the auction process 

we have a broad and deep inventory of products 

we believe that our customers place a high value on availability of a broad range of light vehicle replacement products we also believe that our inventory of recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished products allows us to fill a higher percentage of our customers’ orders than our competitors in addition our ability to share inventory on a regional basis increases the availability of replacement products and also helps us to fill a higher percentage of our customers’ orders we have developed regional trading zones within which we make our inventory available to our local facilities mostly via overnight product transfers we manage our inventory and purchasing on a regional basis to enhance the availability of the products that we believe will be in the highest demand within each region our broad and deep inventory furthers 

our ability to serve as a “onestop” solution for our customers’ recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished product needs 

we have implemented management disciplines 

our management and operations team is highly experienced with many managers having spent their entire careers in the light vehicle recycling industry we have developed and built procurement operating and financial systems that have allowed us to grow and develop our national network and implement professional management techniques and disciplines as our business has grown we have acquired additional management talent which has furthered the sharing of best practices throughout the company in addition our senior management team has extensive acquisition experience and will continue to use our disciplined approach in targeting growth opportunities 

our strategies 

strengthen our national network through internal growth and acquisitions 

we intend to continue to expand our market coverage through a combination of internal development and acquisitions and to look for opportunities to expand into new regions and into adjacent markets we plan to establish a presence in additional major metropolitan markets and a number of smaller markets in the us we have applied an analytical and disciplined approach to our acquisition process and have targeted companies with strong management teams a record of environmental compliance solid growth prospects and a reputation for quality and customer service 

further develop business relationships 

we intend to continue to develop business relationships with automobile insurance companies extended warranty providers and other industry participants we believe that insurance companies and extended warranty providers as payors for many repairs will take a more active role in the selection of replacement products in the repair process in order to use lower cost alternatives to new oem products on behalf of certain insurance company customers we provide a review of vehicle repair order estimates so they may assess the opportunity to increase usage of recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished products in the repair process thereby reducing their costs our employees also provide quotes for our products to assist several insurance companies with their estimate and settlement processes we also work with insurance companies and light vehicle manufacturers to procure salvage vehicles directly from them on a selected basis which provides us an additional source of supply and provides them improved economics on salvage vehicle sales we believe we are positioned to take advantage of the increasing importance of these industry participants and will continue to look for ways to enhance our relationships 

continue to improve our operating results 

we are working to improve our operating results by applying our business disciplines to our most recently acquired facilities continuing to build our network further centralizing certain functions improving our use of technology and increasing revenue at our lower volume facilities our higher volume facilities generally operate at a higher profitability level as a percentage of revenue we believe we can improve the profitability level at our lower volume facilities by achieving the higher volumes and improved economies of scale that we realize at our higher volume facilities we intend to continue to refine our procurement system which uses methodologies that analyze demand levels for our products existing inventory levels and projected margins on an individual vehicle basis 

further develop our technology and business processes 

we continue to emphasize the use of technology in our processes to improve efficiency and to increase the standardization of our business our technology and proprietary processes enhance procurement pricing and inventory management we continue to develop our technology to allow us to better manage and analyze our inventory to assist our sales people with uptodate pricing and availability of our products and to further enhance our procurement process for example many of our representatives responsible for procuring vehicles whom we refer to as “scouts” are equipped with handheld computing devices to assist them in appraising the vehicles prior to submitting a bid to purchase the vehicle 

raise industry standards by being the industry leader 

since our inception we have employed a professional approach to the light vehicle recycling business we continue to seek new ways to improve our methodologies and to communicate our standards to our customers we further believe that by elevating industry standards in areas such as customer service integrity product quality and availability delivery time warranty support environmental compliance and appearance of facilities we can help promote the acceptability of the use of recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished products 

our process 

our operations generally involve the procurement of inventory vehicle processing in the case of wholesale recycled oem products sales and distribution we also perform refurbishing of oem wheel and lighting products such refurbishing work is primarily cosmetic 

procurement of inventory 

we start the process of procuring recycled oem products for our wholesale operations by acquiring severely damaged or totaled vehicles we acquired approximately 111400 salvage vehicles for our wholesale operations in 2006 we purchase the majority of our vehicles from salvage auctions wrecked vehicles are sold at salvage auctions held each weekday throughout the country salvage auctions provide an outlet for salvage vehicles to be processed and sold primarily to automotive recyclers and rebuilders we pay third parties fees to tow the vehicles from the auction to our facilities salvage auctions charge fees both to the supplier of vehicles primarily insurance companies and to the purchaser including us 

for the vast majority of our salvage auction purchases we send a scout in advance of each auction to investigate the vehicles we would be interested in buying the scout obtains key information such as the model mileage and damage assessment and determines which parts on the targeted vehicles are recyclable this information is electronically forwarded to our bid specialists via handheld computing devices or facsimile transmissions the bid specialists analyze the data in light of current demand for the parts in question the levels of our inventory with respect to such parts and the projected margins expected for each vehicle the specialists then set a maximum bid price that our bidders use to purchase the vehicle at auction we believe that this system provides a disciplined approach to procurement 

we also obtain salvage vehicles and parts from insurance companies vehicle manufacturers abandoned vehicle programs and other salvage sources some of these arrangements allow us to acquire salvage vehicles directly from the insurance company or vehicle manufacturer at a cost calculated as a percentage of revenue from such vehicles which is remitted as products are sold from these vehicles these arrangements eliminate the fees we and the insurance company would otherwise pay to the salvage auction and provide us inventory with a lower initial expenditure of capital 

we acquire inventory for our selfservice retail recycled oem products operations from a variety of sources including but not limited to auctions towing companies municipalities insurance carriers charitable organizations and the general public in 2006 we purchased approximately 138700 salvage vehicles for our retail operations 

we purchase aftermarket products from independent manufacturers approximately 55 of our aftermarket products are purchased and imported directly from manufacturers in taiwan approximately 45 of our aftermarket products are purchased from locations in the us however we believe that the majority of these products are manufactured in taiwan and other asian countries no single supplier currently provides more than 21 of our aftermarket products we use a proprietary order management system to procure our aftermarket inventory the system prompts inventory purchases based on stocking levels and historical sales data we believe that the system helps us to procure our aftermarket inventory efficiently and to maintain one of the highest fulfillment rates in the aftermarket products industry 

our refurbished products are processed from cores obtained from our recycled oem locations and from brokers the higher quality cores are then refurbished for popular wheels we also purchase aftermarket wheels from outside vendors to fill demand 

vehicle processing 

vehicle processing for our wholesale operations involves dismantling a salvage vehicle into recycled oem products ready for delivery when a salvage vehicle arrives at one of our facilities an inventory specialist identifies catalogs and schedules the vehicle for dismantling we do not dismantle any vehicle until we have received proper title documentation thereby assuring that the vehicle was not stolen 

the dismantler removes components that will become products for sale products that are placed directly on inventory shelves generally include such items as the engine transmission hood trunk lid head and tail lamp assemblies rear bumper and doors we remove all recyclable items including fluids freon batteries tires and catalytic converters these items are sold to recyclers and reprocessors dismantlers also perform any required cutting of the vehicle frame or body 

each inventory item is entered into our inventory tracking system inspected for quality tagged for identification and prepared for storage and delivery to our customers mechanical products not in a condition to be sold as recycled products or that are in surplus supply are separated and sold in bulk to parts remanufacturers the remaining vehicle hulks and components such as fabrics rubber plastics and glass are delivered to automobile shredders crushers and scrap processors 

sales 

as of december 31 2006 we employed 462 fulltime sales staff in our wholesale recycled oem products operations of these 429 were located at sales desks at our facilities and generally are responsible for accepting incoming calls from and selling our inventory to our customers we put all of our sales personnel through a thorough training program most of our sales personnel are paid primarily on a commission basis in addition as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 33 traveling sales staff who visit our customers and focus on business development in various markets in our aftermarket products operations sales orders are accepted by either our local delivery drivers or by our dedicated aftermarket and refurbished products sales call centers 

we are continually reviewing and revising the pricing of our recycled oem products our pricing specialists take into consideration factors such as location recent demand inventory quantity inventory turnover new oem product prices recycled oem product prices aftermarket and refurbished product prices and remanufactured part prices with the goal of optimizing revenue we update the pricing of our 

aftermarket and refurbished products at least annually when we update our product catalogs or when standard pricing guides are provided to estimating systems we may adjust prices during the year in response to material price changes of oem products 

the inventory base of each of our facilities supplemented by the inventory sharing system within our regional trading zones gives us what we believe to be a competitive advantage through our ability to meet our customers’ requirements more frequently than smaller competitors 

distribution 

each sale results in the generation of a work order a dispatcher is then responsible for ensuring product accuracy printing the final invoice and including the products on the appropriate truck route for delivery to the customer we operate a delivery fleet of mediumsized trucks and smaller trucks and vans these trucks deliver products to our customers within a specified territory typically on a daily basis in markets where we offer recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished products we deliver all of our product types on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs 

additionally we have developed an internal distribution network to allow our sales representatives to sell recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished products from the inventory of nearby facilities within our regional trading zones thus improving our ability to fulfill customer requests and to improve inventory turnover we operate approximately 64 recycled oem product and 36 aftermarket product and refurbished wheel product transfers between our facilities within our regional trading zones each weekday 

our products 

when we procure salvage vehicles we focus on vehicles for which the insured repair market has the most recycled oem product demand these tend to be popular types of vehicles such as sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks and automobile models with high sales volume these vehicles generally are a few model years old as insurers tend to use new oem products on repairs of vehicles that are one to two years old similarly insurers are less likely to authorize the repair of vehicles more than ten model years old the degree of damage is not a significant factor in our process as we only assign value to the undamaged products when we prepare our bids 

our most popular recycled oem products include engines transmissions vehicle front end assemblies doors trunk lids bumper assemblies wheels head and tail lamp assemblies mirrors fenders and axles 

when we obtain a mechanical product wheels or certain lighting products from a dismantled vehicle and determine that we have an excess supply of such product or it is defective the mechanical item is then sold in bulk to mechanical remanufacturers while the wheel and lighting items are sent to our refurbishment locations we refer to these items as core products the majority of the mechanical products are transferred to our core facility in houston texas where we sort them by product and model type examples of such products are engine blocks and heads transmissions starters alternators and air conditioner compressors the wheels and lighting items are sent to our refurbishing facilities 

when we procure aftermarket products and refurbish wheels and lights we focus on products that are in the most demand by the insured repair market our most popular aftermarket products are head lamps tail lamps grilles hoods and mirrors we also focus on aftermarket and refurbished products that would best complement our recycled oem product inventory 

our customers 

insurance companies 

we consider automobile insurance companies our customers as they are a key demand driver for our products our products are delivered directly to the repair shop or installer because insurance companies and extended warranty providers generally do not take receipt of repair parts while insurance companies do not pay for our products directly the insurance company does ultimately pay for the repair of the insured vehicle as a result the insurance company often exerts significant influence in the decisionmaking process as to how a damaged vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the product used in the repair process insurance companies are also concerned with customer satisfaction with the repair process and the total time to return the repaired vehicle to its owner 

repair shops and others 

we sell the majority of our products wholesale to collision repair shops and mechanical repair shops the majority of these customers tend to be individuallyowned small businesses although over the last few years there has been a trend toward consolidation resulting in the formation of several national and regional repair companies we also sell our products to automobile dealerships and fleet management groups in addition we sell our products to individual retail customers at our selfservice retail locations and at certain of our wholesale recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished product locations 

remanufacturers 

a mechanical part that is not suitable for sale as a replacement part or that is a product for which we have an excess supply is sold to mechanical remanufacturers in bulk shipments examples of mechanical parts we sell in this manner are engine blocks and heads transmissions starters alternators and air conditioner compressors remanufacturers usually are significantly larger companies than repair shops our sales to them tend to be large orders and are dependent on their needs for a certain product line 

our employees 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 4100 employees performing operational functions and approximately 170 corporate and regional employees in july 2006 approximately 60 of our employees at our totowa new jersey facility voted to be represented by a union since shortly after the vote we have been in negotiations with the union regarding a collective bargaining agreement no agreement has been reached other than the employees in totowa new jersey none of our employees is a member of a union or participates in other collective bargaining arrangements 

our facilities 

our corporate headquarters are located at 120 north lasalle street suite 3300 chicago illinois 60602 in february 2004 we entered into a new lease which became effective on august 1 2004 to remain in our current office space the term of the new lease is ten years but either party can terminate the lease in july 2009 the primary functions performed at our corporate headquarters are financial accounting treasury marketing business development human resources information systems support and legal in addition to our corporate headquarters we have numerous operating facilities that handle recycled oem products aftermarket and refurbished products and selfservice retail products a majority of these facilities are leased 

recycled oem parts 

our wholesale recycled oem parts facilities are located among eight geographic regions a typical facility has processing sales and distribution operations including a large warehouse with multiple bays to dismantle vehicles indoor and outdoor storage areas and administrative and sales offices equipment typically used at each facility includes hydraulic lifts forklifts and loaders and hand tools to dismantle vehicles we also have facilities that operate primarily as redistribution centers as of february 23 2007 we conducted our wholesale recycled oem parts operations from 67 facilities 53 of which include a combination of processing sales and redistribution operations and 14 of which are primarily redistribution facilities we also have three recycled oem parts facilities in central america 

aftermarket parts 

we conduct our aftermarket parts business from facilities that serve as sales warehousing or distribution centers for these parts as of february 23 2007 we conducted our aftermarket parts operations from approximately   48   facilities 20 of which are colocated at wholesale recycle facilities the largest of these facilities are located in columbus ohio charlotte north carolina dallas texas oakland california pennsauken new jersey totowa new jersey landover maryland atlanta georgia chicago illinois webster massachusetts and topeka kansas 

refurbished parts 

we refurbish wheels at four facilities located in connecticut florida indiana and michigan we also distribute wheels from two locations one in illinois located within our chicago aftermarket warehouse and one in michigan as a result of a 2007 acquisition we refurbish head lamps and tail lamps at a facility in grand rapids michigan 

selfservice retail parts 

our selfservice retail parts facilities typically consist of several acres of vehicles stored outdoors and a retail building through which customers access the vehicles as of february 23 2007 we conducted our selfservice retail parts operations from 22 facilities in the united states 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry we consider all suppliers of light vehicle products to be competitors including participants in the recycled oem product market oems parts remanufacturers suppliers of aftermarket and refurbished products and internetbased suppliers we believe the principal areas of competition in our industry include pricing product quality service and availability of inventory 

we compete with more than 6000 domestic light vehicle product recyclers most of which are singleunit operators we believe most of the light vehicle parts recyclers in the us have less than 30 million in annual revenue in some markets smaller competitors have organized affiliations to share marketing and distribution resources greenleaf llc a light vehicle recycling business started by ford motor company is our largest competitor in the light vehicle oem product recycling business schnitzer steel industries inc a company with operations in the steel manufacturing metals recycling and vehicle product recycling businesses purchased greenleaf on september 30 2005 schnitzer steel is a significant operator in the selfservice retail recycling business 

we also compete with distributors of aftermarket and refurbished collision light vehicle products the largest distributor of these products in the us is keystone automotive industries inc 

manufacturers of new original equipment parts sell the majority of light vehicle replacement products we believe however that as the insurance and repair industries come to appreciate the advantages of recycled oem aftermarket and refurbished products those products can account for a larger percentage of total vehicle replacement product sales 

information technology 

we use a single third party facility management system in most of our wholesale recycled oem operations we believe that a single system helps us with the continued implementation of standard operating procedures training efficiency employee transferability access to a national inventory database management reporting and data storage it also eliminates the need to create multiple versions of proprietary applications and systems support processes 

the major features of our facility management system include inventory control customer selling and billing sales analysis vehicle tracking and profitability reporting the system also supports an electronic exchange system for identifying and locating parts at other selected recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock 

we have separate third party providers for our financial systems such as financial and budget reporting general ledger accounting accounts payable payroll and fixed assets we utilize the same common financial systems throughout the majority of our operations 

we currently protect our local customer inventory and corporate consolidated data such as financial information email files and other user files with daily backups these backups are stored off site with a third party data protection vendor 

we have consolidated our facility management systems onto regional system platforms the hardware for all such platforms is located at a single data center the center is in a secure environment with aroundtheclock monitoring redundant power backup and multiple diverse data and telecommunication routing facility management system data is “mirrored” replicated off site in real time to a disaster recovery facility located in a different part of the country this disaster recovery facility is also housed in a secure environment with aroundtheclock monitoring redundant power backup and multiple diverse data and telecommunications routing 

currently our aftermarket refurbishing and selfservice retail operations each use a separate facility management system 

regulation 

environmental compliance 

our operations and properties including the maintenance of our delivery vehicles are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations these environmental laws govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials 

we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters we have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements we cannot assure you however that we will at all times be in complete compliance with such requirements 

although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot assure you that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

contamination resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release storage transportation or disposal of gasoline motor oil antifreeze transmission fluid cfcs from air conditioners other hazardous materials or metals such as aluminum cadmium chromium lead and mercury contamination can migrate onsite or offsite which can increase the risk and the amount of any potential liability 

in addition many of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use which may have involved hazardous materials as a result some of our properties may be contaminated some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination even if these owners or operators did not know of and were not responsible for such contamination these environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of treats or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties or successors to such owners or operators for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 

when we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process we analyze the risks and when appropriate perform further environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination furthermore where appropriate we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters in addition at times we or one of the sellers from whom we purchased a business have undertaken remediation projects we do not anticipate based on currently available information and current laws that we will incur liabilities in excess of reserves to address environmental matters however in the event we discover new information or if laws change we may incur significant liabilities which may exceed our reserves 

title laws 

in some states when a vehicle is deemed a total loss a salvage title is issued whether states issue salvage titles is important to the light vehicle recycling industry because an increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles currently these titling issues are a matter of state law in 1992 the us congress commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle titling registration and salvage since then legislation has been introduced seeking to establish national uniform requirements in this area including a uniform definition of a salvage vehicle the light vehicle recycling industry will generally favor a uniform definition since it will avoid inconsistencies across state lines and will generally favor a definition that expands the number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage however certain interest groups including repair shops and some insurance associations may oppose this type of legislation national legislation has not yet been enacted in this area and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in the future 

national stolen passenger motor vehicle information system 

in 1992 congress enacted the anti car theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles this law included the establishment of the national stolen passenger motor vehicle information system to track 

and monitor stolen automotive parts in april 2002 the department of justice published for comment proposed regulations to implement the national stolen passenger motor vehicle information system the proposed regulations require among other things that insurance companies salvagers dismantlers recyclers and repairers inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the vehicle identification number and the part number for any “covered major part” that possesses the vehicle identification number the requirement to collect this information would place substantial burdens on light vehicle recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair shops which may further discourage the use by such shops of recycled products the department of justice’s comment period for the proposed regulations ended in june 2002 but final regulations have not been issued 

legislation affecting automotive repair parts 

most states have laws that restrict the use of aftermarket parts in collision repair work these restrictions range from the requirement to disclose to the vehicle owner the use of aftermarket parts in the repair process to the requirement to have aftermarket parts certified by an independent testing organization some jurisdictions have laws that prohibit or restrict the sale of certain recycled oem products that we provide such as airbags additional laws of this kind may be introduced in the future an increase in the number of states passing such legislation or the passing of legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on our business additionally congress could enact federal legislation restricting the use of aftermarket and recycled automotive parts in the repair process 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather related accidents in addition the cost of salvage vehicles tends to be lower as more weather related accidents occur generating a larger supply of total loss vehicles 




 item 1a   risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

we face intense competition from local national and internetbased light vehicle products providers and this competition could negatively affect our business 

the light vehicle replacement products industry is highly competitive and is served by numerous suppliers of oem products recycled oem products aftermarket products and refurbished products within each of these categories of suppliers there are local owneroperated companies larger regional suppliers national providers and internetbased suppliers providers of light vehicle replacement products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of light vehicle replacement products which may further increase competition some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise greater financial technical manufacturing distribution and other resources longer operating histories lower cost structures and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries in certain regions of the us local light vehicle recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in the recycled oem products industry as a result of these factors our competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply provide their products at lower costs or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve 

an adverse change in our relationships with auction companies or our suppliers could increase our expenses and hurt our ability to serve our customers 

most of our salvage inventory is obtained from vehicles offered at salvage auctions by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the us we do not have contracts with any auction company according to industry analysts three companies control over 65 of the salvage auction market in the us in some localities the automotive auction business may be even more highly concentrated if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions or significantly raised its fees our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers moreover we are facing increased competition in the purchase of salvage vehicles from shredders and scrap recyclers internetbased buyers and others this increase in the number of bidders may increase our cost of goods sold for recycled oem products 

we also acquire some of our inventory directly from insurance companies original equipment manufacturers aftermarket parts manufacturers and others to the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue these arrangements our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers 

in addition we purchase aftermarket parts primarily from foreign manufacturers in taiwan in the event that our business relationships with these suppliers deteriorated or terminated or in the event that the importing of products into the us from taiwan or the exporting of products by taiwan to the us was disrupted our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting inability to service our customers 

we may not be able to sell our products due to existing or new laws and regulations prohibiting or restricting the sale of recycled oem or aftermarket products 

some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled oem products that we provide such as airbags these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled oem products restrictions on the products we are able to sell could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

we became involved in the aftermarket products business upon the closing of an acquisition in february 2004 since 1998 most states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair work andor require enhanced disclosure or vehicle owner consent before using aftermarket products in such repair work additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future if additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business 

certain organizations test the quality and safety of light vehicle replacement products in the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product such events could adversely affect our business 

if our business relationships with insurance companies end we may lose important sales opportunities 

we rely on business relationships with several insurance companies these insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide our arrangements with these companies may be terminated at any time we rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things 

·   the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water

·   the exposure to hazardous materials and

·   the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials

we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also become liable if employees or other third parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials 

under certain environmental laws we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at or migration to or from our or our predecessors’ past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or was not responsible for the release of such hazardous substances 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits 

our operating subsidiaries must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations when we develop or acquire a new facility we must seek the approval of state and local units of government governmental agencies often resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling facility in their communities there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold 

proposed regulations under the national stolen passenger motor vehicle information system could harm our business 

in 1992 congress enacted the anti car theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles this law included the establishment of the national stolen passenger motor vehicle information system to track and monitor stolen automotive parts in april 2002 the department of justice published for comment proposed regulations to implement this system the proposed regulations require among other things that insurance companies salvagers dismantlers recyclers and repairers inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the vehicle identification number and the part number for any covered major part that possesses the vehicle identification number the requirement to collect this information would place burdens and costs on us that otherwise would not normally exist and could discourage our customers from purchasing our products if the proposed regulations are adopted 

we could be subject to product liability claims 

if customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage we could be subject to product liability claims the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business or financial condition 

we may lose business if recent litigation involving the use of aftermarket parts results in insurance companies modifying arrangements affecting the use of recycled oem or aftermarket products in the repair process 

in an illinois lawsuit involving state farm mutual automobile insurance company  “avery v state farm”  a jury decided in october 1999 that state farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using nonoem parts to repair damaged vehicles when use of such parts did not restore the vehicle to its “preloss condition” the jury found that state farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of nonoem parts and the alleged inferiority of those parts the jury assessed damages against state farm of 456 million and the judge assessed an additional 730 million of disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the illinois consumer fraud act in april 2001 the illinois appellate court upheld the verdict but reduced the damage award by 130 million because of duplicative damage awards on august 18 2005 the illinois supreme court reversed the awards made by the circuit court and found among other things that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any breach of contract on the part of state farm the us supreme court declined to hear an appeal of this case as a result of this case some insurance companies had reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket products although our products are primarily recycled oem parts we entered the aftermarket products business through an acquisition in february 2004 our financial results could be affected perhaps adversely if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled oem products from us due to a fear of similar claims with respect to such products 

if the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines our business could suffer 

because our business depends on vehicle accidents for both the supply of recycled oem products and the demand for repairs using our products factors which influence the number andor severity of accidents including but not limited to the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven the ages of drivers the use of cellular telephones and other electronic equipment by drivers the congestion of traffic the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers and the condition of roadways impact our business in this regard a number of states and municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones while driving and such restrictions could lead to a decline in accidents moreover an increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road to decline as motorists seek alternative transportation options and this also could lead to a decline in accidents 

we may not be able to successfully acquire new operations or integrate future acquisitions which could cause our business to suffer 

we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms or for other reasons if we buy a company or a division of a company we may experience difficulty integrating that company’s or division’s personnel and operations which could negatively affect our operating results in addition 

·   the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us

·   we may experience business disruptions as a result of information technology systems conversions

·   we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning treasury management and financial reporting

·   we may be held liable for environmental risks and liabilities as a result of our acquisitions some of which we may not have discovered during our due diligence

·   our ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention and

·   we may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated

in connection with future acquisitions we may assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire these liabilities including liabilities for environmentalrelated costs could materially and adversely affect our business we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition the issuance of which could involve the imposition of restrictive covenants or be dilutive to our existing stockholders 

our credit facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and requires us to meet certain financial tests 

our credit facility contains certain operating and financial restrictions that limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions including the following 

·   incurring or guarantying additional debt

·   paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming repurchasing or retiring our capital stock or subordinated obligations

·   making investments and capital expenditures

·   creating liens on our assets

·   selling transferring leasing licensing or otherwise disposing of assets other than in the ordinary course of business

·   engaging in transactions with stockholders and affiliates

·   engaging in mergers consolidations or acquisitions

·   engaging in any material line of business substantially different from and unrelated to those lines of business currently carried on by us and

·   making changes to our equity capital structure or amending our certificate of incorporation bylaws or any stockholder rights agreement

the credit facility also requires that we satisfy certain financial tests the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit facility a default if not waived could result in acceleration of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing credit facility or it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 

our future capital needs may require that we seek debt financing or additional equity funding that if not available could cause our business to suffer 

we may need to raise additional funds in the future to among other things fund our existing operations improve or expand our operations respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions from time to time we may raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic alliances or other arrangements if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to further limitations on our operations if we fail to raise capital when needed our business will be negatively affected 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control future factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the following 

·   fluctuations in the pricing of new oem replacement products

·   the availability and cost of inventory

·   variations in vehicle accident rates

·   competition in the vehicle replacement parts industry

·   changes in state or federal laws or regulations affecting our business

·   changes in the types of replacement parts that insurance carriers will accept in the repair process

·   our ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully

·   fluctuations in fuel prices

·   changes in the demand for our products and the supply of our inventory due to severity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns

·   the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business operations and infrastructure and

·   declines in the values of our assets

due to the foregoing factors our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate accordingly our results of operations may not be indicative of future performance these fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

if we lose our key management personnel we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives if we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel which could harm our business 

we rely on information technology in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business 

we use information technology systems owned by other companies for management of our facilities and our financial functions in the event that the providers of these systems terminate their relationships with us we could suffer disruptions to our operations 

in addition we continually monitor these systems to find areas for improvement in the event that we decided to switch providers or to implement our own systems we may also suffer disruptions to our business we may be unsuccessful in the development of our own systems and we may underestimate the 

costs and expenses of developing and implementing our own systems also our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system which period could extend longer than we anticipated 

if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks our business could be harmed 

we use a fleet of trucks to deliver the majority of the products we sell we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in the transportation infrastructure availability and price of fuel liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance and insurance premium increases in addition our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur significant charges to our pretax income 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations in the future goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of future acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed at least annually for impairment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business as of december 31 2006 our total goodwill subject to future impairment testing was approximately 2462 million 

challenges to the validity of aftermarket products could adversely effect our business 

original equipment manufacturers have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims the original equipment manufacturers have brought such claims in federal court and with the united states international trade commission 

in december 2005 ford global technologies llc initiated a complaint with the international trade commission against six companies including a competitor of ours keystone automotive industries inc alleging that certain aftermarket parts imported into the united states infringed on 14 design patents held by ford global we were not named in the complaint although the outcome would affect all persons and entities who import or distribute the parts including us in december 2006 an administrative law judge of the international trade commission preliminarily ruled that seven of the ford global design patents were valid and that the importation of automotive parts covered by these seven patents violated section 337 of the tariff act of 1930 the ruling of the administrative law judge is not final it will be reviewed by the international trade commission if the international trade commission agrees with the ruling it will issue an order prohibiting further importation of automotive parts covered by the patents the parties to the action can appeal the commission’s final decision to the united states circuit court of appeals for the federal circuit 

to the extent that the original equipment manufacturers are successful with intellectual property infringement claims we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business if we are subsequently named as a defendant in any such claims we would likely incur significant expenses defending the claims even if we are not named in any such claims written allegations that we are infringing another party’s intellectual property rights could involve significant expense to investigate 

risks relating to our common stock 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other stockholders 

as of december 31 2006 our executive officers directors and their affiliates in the aggregate beneficially owned approximately 21 of our common stock if they were to act together these stockholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by stockholders including the election of directors any amendments to our certificate of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions these stockholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other stockholders in addition without the consent of these stockholders we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that may be viewed as beneficial to us or our other stockholders 

future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 

we and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock in the future we may also issue shares of common stock in connection with the exercise of outstanding options or in connection with future acquisitions certain of our existing stockholders are parties to a registration rights agreement that provides such holders with the right to require us to effect the registration of their shares of common stock in specific circumstances in addition if we propose to register any of our common stock under the securities act of 1933 whether for our own account or otherwise some existing stockholders may be entitled to include their shares of common stock in that registration we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued in connection with an acquisition or the perception that such sales could occur may cause the price of our common stock to fall 

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover which could affect the price of our stock 

the antitakeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could together or separately impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult our incorporation under delaware law and these provisions could also impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquiror from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the price of our common stock

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we provide replacement systems components and parts needed to repair light vehicles cars and light trucks buyers of light vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily three sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers “oems” which are commonly known as oem products new products produced by companies other than the oems which are sometimes referred to as “aftermarket” products and recycled products originally produced by oems which we refer to as recycled oem products we participate in the market for recycled oem products as well as the market for collision repair aftermarket products we obtain aftermarket products and salvage vehicles from a variety of sources and we dismantle the salvage vehicles to obtain a comprehensive range of vehicle products that we distribute into the light vehicle repair market we recently entered the business of refurbishing and distributing aluminum alloy wheels head lamps and tail lamps these acquisitions allowed us to expand our product offerings to our customers we are not involved in the manufacture of automotive products and do not maintain any manufacturing or remanufacturing operations 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to 

·   fluctuations in the pricing of new oem replacement products

·   the availability and cost of inventory

·   variations in vehicle accident rates

·   competition in the vehicle replacement parts industry

·   changes in state or federal laws or regulations affecting our business

·   changes in the types of replacement parts that insurance carriers will accept in the repair process

·   our ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully

·   fluctuations in fuel prices

·   changes in the demand for our products and the supply of our inventory due to severity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns

·   the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business operations and infrastructure and

·   declines in the value of our assets

due to the foregoing factors our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate accordingly our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance 

acquisitions 

since our inception in 1998 we have pursued a growth strategy of both organic growth and acquisitions we have pursued acquisitions that we believe will help drive profitability cash flow and stockholder value our principal focus for acquisitions is companies that will expand our geographic presence and our ability to provide a wider choice of alternative light vehicle replacement products and services to our customers 

during 2004 we acquired six businesses five in the recycled oem automotive parts business and one in the aftermarket automotive parts business for an aggregate of approximately 617 million in cash 24 million in notes issued and 373396 shares of our common stock these business acquisitions enabled us to serve new markets expand our presence in certain markets become a significant provider of aftermarket automotive replacement parts and become a provider of selfservice retail automotive parts one of the acquisitions had operations in guatemala and costa rica the revenue of the central american businesses is not material but we are using these facilities as a platform to sell certain types of products into central america from our us based recycled oem automotive replacement parts facilities 

during 2005 we acquired eight businesses four in the recycled oem automotive parts business and four in the aftermarket automotive parts business for an aggregate of approximately 1080 million in cash 64 million in notes issued and 9 million contingently payable based on the achievement of certain future financial results certain terms of one of the contingent payment agreements were modified in 2006 such that 10 million was immediately paid and the maximum remaining amount contingently payable was reduced to 40 million these business acquisitions enabled us to serve new markets and expand our presence in existing markets 

during 2006 we acquired ten businesses one in the wheel refurbishing and distribution business two in the aftermarket automotive parts business and seven in the recycled oem automotive parts business for an aggregate of approximately 711 million in cash and 72 million in notes issued these business acquisitions enabled us to expand our product offerings to our customers serve new markets and expand our presence in existing markets 

in the first quarter of 2007 we acquired two businesses one in the recycled oem automotive parts business and one that refurbishes head lamps and tail lamps these business acquisitions enabled us to expand our presence in existing markets serve new market areas and expand our product line offering 

sources of revenue 

since 2004 our revenue from the sale of light vehicle replacement products and related services has ranged between 84 and 92 of our total revenue we sell the majority of our light vehicle replacement products to collision repair shops and mechanical repair shops our light vehicle replacement products include for example engines transmissions frontends doors trunk lids bumpers hoods fenders grilles valances wheels head lamps and tail lamps we sell extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products these contracts cover the cost of parts and labor and are sold for periods of six months one year or two years we defer the revenue from such contracts and recognize it ratably over the term of the contracts the demand for our products and services is influenced by several factors including the number of vehicles in operation the number of miles being driven the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents availability and pricing of new parts seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions additionally automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process accordingly we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our products we provide insurance companies services that include the review of vehicle repair order estimates as well as direct quotation services to their adjusters there is no standard price for recycled oem products but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as product availability quality demand new oem replacement product prices the age of the vehicle being repaired and competitor pricing the pricing for aftermarket and refurbished products is determined based on a number of factors including availability quality demand new oem replacement product prices and competitor pricing 

since 2004 approximately 8 to 16 of our revenue has been obtained from other sources these include bulk sales to mechanical remanufacturers scrap sales and sales of damaged vehicles that we sell to 

vehicle repairers our revenue from other sources has increased since 2004 primarily due to higher scrap sales from our selfservice retail and wheel operations and to higher bulk sales of certain products 

when we obtain mechanical products from dismantled vehicles and determine they are damaged or when we have a surplus of a certain mechanical product type we sell them in bulk to mechanical remanufacturers the majority of these products are sorted by product type and model type examples of such products are engine blocks and heads transmissions starters alternators and air conditioner compressors after we have recovered all the products we intend to resell the remaining materials are crushed and sold to scrap processors 

cost of goods sold 

our cost of goods sold for recycled oem products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and where applicable auction storage and towing fees we are facing increased competition in the purchase of salvage vehicles from shredders and scrap recyclers internetbased buyers and others our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles since 2004 our labor and laborrelated costs related to acquisition and dismantling have accounted for approximately 10 of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle the acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and as a result energy costs are not material 

our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts freight and other inventoried costs such as import fees and duties where applicable our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors located primarily overseas with the majority of our overseas vendors located in taiwan our cost of goods sold for refurbished wheels includes the price we pay for wheel cores freight and costs to refurbish the wheels including overhead and depreciation costs 

in the event we do not have a recycled oem product or suitable aftermarket product in our inventory we attempt to purchase the part from a competitor we refer to these parts as brokered products since 2004 the revenue from brokered products that we sell to our customers has ranged from 5 to 8 of our total revenue the gross margin on brokered product sales as a percentage of revenue is generally less than half of what we achieve from sales of our own inventory because we must pay higher prices for these products 

some of our mechanical products are sold with a standard sixmonth warranty against defects we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claim information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses our warranty activity during 2005 and 2006 was as follows in thousands 

 

  

we also sell separately priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products the expense related to extended warranty claims is recognized when the claim is made 

expenses 

our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our processing redistribution selfservice and warehouse facilities these costs include labor for both plant management and facility and warehouse personnel stockbased compensation facility rent property and liability insurance utilities and other occupancy costs 

our distribution expenses primarily include our costs to deliver our products to our customers included in our distribution expense category are labor costs for drivers local delivery and transfer truck rentals and subcontractor costs vehicle repairs and maintenance insurance and fuel 

our selling and marketing expenses primarily include our advertising promotion and marketing costs salary and commission expenses for sales personnel sales training telephone and other communication expenses and bad debt expense since 2004 personnel costs have accounted for approximately 77 to 81 of our selling and marketing expenses most of our recycled oem product sales personnel are paid on a commission basis the number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our customers’ needs and increase our sales volume our objective is to continually evaluate our sales force develop and implement training programs and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness 

our general and administrative expenses include primarily the costs of our corporate and regional offices that provide corporate and field management treasury accounting legal payroll business development human resources and information systems functions these costs include wages and benefits for corporate regional and administrative personnel stockbased compensation long term incentive compensation accounting legal and other professional fees office supplies telephone and other communication costs insurance and rent 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather related accidents in addition the cost of salvage vehicles tends to be lower as more weather related accidents occur generating a larger supply of total loss vehicles 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition warranty costs inventory valuation allowance for doubtful accounts goodwill impairments selfinsurance programs contingencies asset impairments stockbased compensation and taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue actual results may differ from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize and report revenue from the sale of light vehicle replacement products when they are shipped and title has transferred subject to a reserve for returns discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information a replacement product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment our customers may earn discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment we analyze historical returns and allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates we use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold 

we also sell separately priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products revenue from these contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the contracts 

warranty reserves 

we issue a standard sixmonth warranty against defects on some of our mechanical products we record an accrual for standard warranty claims at the time of sale using historical warranty claim information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses we analyze historical warranty claim activity by referencing the claims made and aging them from the original product sale date we use this information to project future warranty claims on actual products sold that are still under warranty at the end of an accounting period a 10 increase in our historical 2006 annual warranty claims would result in an additional annual expense of approximately 03 million 

inventory accounting 

salvage inventory   salvage inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle and includes buying dismantling and where applicable auction storage and towing fees inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facility’s inventory at expected selling prices the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility’s historical vehicle profitability for salvage vehicles purchased at auction or from contracted rates for salvage vehicles acquired under direct procurement arrangements

aftermarket and refurbished wheel inventory   aftermarket and refurbished wheel inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market our aftermarket inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for parts and includes expenses incurred for freight and buying where applicable for items purchased from foreign sources import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included our refurbished wheel inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for wheel cores and includes expenses incurred for freight buying and refurbishing overhead

for all inventory our carrying value is reduced regularly to reflect the age and current anticipated demand for our products if actual demand differs from our estimates additional reductions to our inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts the aging of the accounts receivable and our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts at december 31 2006 was approximately 26 million which represents 50 of gross receivables if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts may be insufficient to cover the uncollectible receivables which would 

have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence a 10 change in the 2006 annual writeoff rate would result in a change in the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately 02 million for our light vehicle replacement parts operations our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable is limited because the majority of our sales are to a large number of small customers that are generally geographically dispersed we also have certain customers in our light vehicle replacement parts operations that pay for products at the time of delivery the aluminum smelter and our mechanical core operation sell in larger quantities to a small number of distributors foundry customers and remanufacturers as a result our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable is greater in these operations we control credit risk through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring policies 

goodwill impairment 

we record goodwill as a result of our acquisitions statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which we refer to as sfas 142 requires us to analyze our goodwill for impairment at least annually the determination of the value of goodwill requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events may indicate that an impairment exists in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill 

we utilize outside professionals in the valuation industry to validate our assumptions and overall methodology used to determine the fair value estimates used in our goodwill impairment testing as of december 31 2006 we had 2462 million in goodwill subject to future impairment tests if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments in future periods we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results we determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarters of 2006 2005 and 2004 a 10 decrease in the fair value estimates used in the fourth quarter of 2006 impairment test would not have changed this determination 

selfinsurance programs 

we selfinsure a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program we also selfinsure a portion of automobile general liability and workers’ compensation claims we have purchased stoploss insurance coverage that limits our exposure to both individual claims as well as our overall claims the cost of the stoploss insurance is expensed over the contract periods 

we record an accrual for the claims expense related to our employee medical benefits automobile general liability and workers’ compensation claims based upon the expected amount of all such claims if actual claims are higher than what we anticipated our accrual might be insufficient to cover our claims costs which would have an adverse impact on our operating results in that period if we were to incur claims up to our aggregate stoploss insurance coverage during the open policy years we would have an additional expense of approximately 133 million 

contingencies 

we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business resulting from litigation claims and other commitments and from a variety of environmental and pollution 

control laws and regulations we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies we accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we determine the amount of reserves if any with the assistance of our outside legal counsel we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether the accruals should be adjusted if the amount of an actual loss were greater than the amount we have accrued the excess loss would have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period that the loss occurred if the loss contingency is subsequently determined to no longer be probable the amount of loss contingency previously accrued would be included in our operating results in the period such determination was made 

accounting for income taxes 

all income tax amounts reflect the use of the liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions with different tax rates and we determine the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based upon various estimates and assumptions in the normal course of business we will undergo tax audits by various tax jurisdictions such audits often require an extended period of time to complete and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates although we have recorded all probable income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” and sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” these accruals represent estimates that are subject to the inherent uncertainties associated with the tax audit process and therefore include contingencies 

we record a provision for taxes based upon our effective income tax rate we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we expect is more likely than not to be realized we consider historical taxable income expectations and risks associated with our estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we had a valuation allowance of 09 million 07 million and 05 million at december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively against our deferred tax assets should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made conversely should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made 

stockbased compensation 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” a revision of sfas 123 sfas 123r supersedes accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and amends sfas 95 “statement of cash flows” sfas 123r requires us to measure compensation cost for all sharebased payments including employee stock options at fair value and to recognize the cost over the vesting period and was effective for us on january 1 2006 in march 2005 the securities and exchange commission the “sec” issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” regarding the sec staff position concerning the application of sfas 123r including interpretive guidance we implemented the provisions of sfas 123r and sab 107 in the first quarter of 2006 using the modified prospective method pursuant to which prior periods are not restated compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized prospectively based upon the requirements of sfas 123r and compensation expense for all unvested sharebased payments as of january 1 2006 that were issued 

subsequent to the filing of our registration statement for our initial public offering in october 2003 is recognized prospectively based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” net of estimated forfeitures we have elected to recognize compensation expense for all awards on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award the impact of adopting sfas 123r on 2006 results was as follows 

·   a reduction of income before income taxes by 24 million

·   a reduction of net income by 14 million and

·   a reduction of diluted earnings per share by 003

prior to january 1 2006 we accounted for our stock option plans under the intrinsic value method as defined in apb 25 and related interpretations compensation cost was recognized in net income for options granted under our plans only when the exercise price was less than the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant for nonqualified stock options granted under our plans with an exercise price equal to the market value of the stock on the date of grant no compensation cost was recognized in our financial statements rather stockbased compensation expense was included as a pro forma disclosure in the notes to our financial statements pro forma disclosures of net earnings and earnings per share continue to be provided for periods prior to january 1 2006 

for valuing our stock option awards under sfas 123r several key factors and assumptions are required for use in the valuation models currently utilized we have been in existence since early 1998 and have been a public company since october 2003 as a result we do not have the historical data necessary to consider using a lattice valuation model at this time we have therefore elected to use the blackscholes valuation model using the guidance in sab 107 for determining our expected term and volatility assumptions for expected term we have what sab 107 defines as “plainvanilla” stock options and therefore used a simple average of the vesting period and the contractual term for options granted in 2006 as permitted by sab 107 volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of the option for volatility we considered our own volatility for the limited time we have been a public company as well as the disclosed volatilities of companies that are considered comparable to us our forfeiture assumption is based on historical forfeiture rates both preipo and since we have been a public company sfas 123r requires that forfeitures be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the dividend yield represents the dividend rate expected to be paid over the option’s expected term and we currently have no plans to pay dividends the riskfree interest rate is based on zerocoupon us government issues available at the time each option is granted that have a remaining life approximately equal to the option’s expected life key assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock options granted in 2006 were expected term of 62 years riskfree interest rate of 438 dividend yield of 0 forfeiture rate of 7 and volatility of 40 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” “sfas 151” sfas 151 amended arb 43 chapter 4 to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted materials spoilage must be recognized as current period charges it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities sfas 151 was effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we adopted sfas 151 and its adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” “sfas 154” sfas 154 replaced accounting principles board opinion no 20 “accounting changes” and sfas no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statementsan amendment of apb opinion no 28” sfas 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections sfas 154 requires “retrospective application” of the direct effect of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior periods’ financial statements where it is practicable to do so sfas 154 also redefines the term “restatement” to mean the correction of an error by revising previously issued financial statements sfas 154 was effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 we adopted sfas 154 and its adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows except to the extent that the statement subsequently requires retrospective application of a future item 

in july 2006 the fasb issued financial interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” fin 48 provides guidance on the measurement recognition and disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 provides that a tax position should only be recognized if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties transition and disclosure the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin 48 will be reported as an adjustment of beginning retained earnings in the period of adoption and will be effective for our fiscal year beginning january 1 2007 we are currently assessing the impact of fin 48 on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of ongoing liquidity are cash flow from our operations and our credit facility at december 31 2006 we had cash and equivalents amounting to 40 million and we had 860 million outstanding under our 135 million unsecured bank credit facility we generated 524 million in cash flow from operating activities in 2006 and based on our current plans we expect to generate positive cash flow from operating activities for 2007 we believe that cash flow from operating activities and availability under our credit facility will be adequate to fund our short term liquidity needs under an accordion option feature in our bank agreement we can increase the total credit facility to 150 million subject to the approval of our bank group in addition with a senior debt to ebitda ratio of approximately 11 at the end of 2006 we believe we would be able to further increase our debt capacity significantly if needed 

our liquidity needs are primarily to fund working capital requirements and expand our facilities and network the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under some direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles we normally pay for aftermarket parts purchases at the time of shipment or on standard payment terms depending on the manufacturer and payment options offered wheel cores acquired from third parties are normally paid on standard payment terms we acquired approximately 84600 97600 and 111400 wholesale salvage vehicles in 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively in addition we acquired approximately 27700 55800 and 138700 salvage vehicles for our selfservice retail operations in 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively our purchases of aftermarket parts and wheels totaled approximately 234 million 460 million and 945 million in 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively 

we completed the sale of 64 million shares of our common stock at a price of 1450 per share in a public offering in october 2005 this resulted in approximately 879 million of cash proceeds to us net of underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses of the offering in connection with the offering certain members of management exercised stock options to purchase 600000 shares of our common stock resulting in approximately 21 million of proceeds to us we used all of the proceeds from the offering and the option exercises to pay down our then outstanding bank debt and invested the remaining proceeds in short term cash equivalents until we used them for general corporate purposes which included three acquisitions completed by the end of 2005 we have since used the remaining proceeds for business acquisitions during 2006 

we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of redistribution centers processing facilities and warehouses through further integration of aftermarket refurbished and recycled oem product facilities and through selected business acquisitions our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1107 million in 2006 compared to 1260 million in 2005 we invested 735 million of cash for acquisitions in 2006 compared to 1038 million in 2005 we repaid 26 million from escrow liabilities in 2006 compared to receiving 26 million deposited in 2005 all related to a 2004 acquisition net property and equipment purchases increased 105 million in 2006 due primarily to land acquisitions and facility expansions

recycled salvage locations accounts payable decreased as we accelerated payments to certain foreign vendors in order to realize improved pricing on certain aftermarket product purchases escrow liabilities increased as a result of the deposit in escrow with us of 26 million in cash as collateral in connection with an acquisition by us accrued liabilities increased primarily due to the timing of wage payments higher incentive compensation accruals and higher selfinsurance reserves for workers’ compensation and auto liability claims income taxes payable increased primarily due to higher levels of taxable income 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1260 million in 2005 compared to 878 million in 2004 we invested 1038 million of cash in eight acquisitions in 2005 compared to 616 million in six acquisitions in 2004 we received 26 million in proceeds from the escrow deposit we also realized 07 million in increased proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and 04 million from the sale of investment securities in 2005

on february 17 2004 we entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility that was originally scheduled to mature in february 2007 replacing a secured credit facility that would have expired on june 30 2005 the new credit facility initially had a maximum availability of 750 million which was amended to 100 million on january 31 2005 on june 1 2005 the agreement was further amended to increase the maximum availability to 135 million extend the maturity date to june 1 2010 and modify certain other terms in order to make any borrowing under the credit facility after giving effect to any such borrowing we must be in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit facility including without limitation a senior debt to ebitda ratio which cannot exceed 300 to 100 the credit facility contains customary covenants including among other things limitations on payment of cash dividends restrictions on our payment of other dividends and on purchases redemptions and acquisitions of our stock limitations on additional indebtedness certain limitations on acquisitions mergers and consolidations and the maintenance of certain financial ratios we were in compliance with all covenants throughout all of 2006 and 2005 the interest rate on advances under the credit facility may be at our option either the bank prime lending rate on the one hand or the interbank offering rate ibor plus an additional percentage ranging from 875 to 1625 on the other hand the percentage added to ibor is dependent upon our total funded debt to ebitda ratio for the trailing four quarters 

we may in the future borrow additional amounts under our credit facility or enter into new or additional borrowing arrangements we anticipate that any proceeds from such new or additional borrowing arrangements will be used for general corporate purposes including to develop and acquire businesses and redistribution facilities to further the integration of our aftermarket wheel refurbishing and recycled oem product facilities to expand and improve existing facilities to purchase property equipment and inventory and for working capital 

as part of the consideration for business acquisitions completed during 2006 we issued promissory notes totaling approximately 72 million the notes bear interest at annual rates of 35 to 50 and interest is payable at maturity 

as part of the consideration for business acquisitions completed during 2005 we issued promissory notes totaling approximately 64 million the notes bear interest at annual rates of 30 to 35 and interest is payable at maturity we also assumed certain liabilities in connection with a business acquisition 

which included a promissory note with a remaining principal balance of 02 million the annual interest rate on that note is 51 

we estimate that our capital expenditures for 2007 excluding business acquisitions will be between 450 and 500 million we expect to use these funds for several major facility expansions improvement of current facilities real estate acquisitions and systems development projects we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities for 2007 will be in excess of 550 million 

we believe that our current cash and equivalents cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements however we may from time to time raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements there can be no assurance that additional funding or refinancing of our credit facility if needed will be available on terms attractive to us or at all furthermore any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

offbalance sheet arrangements and future commitments 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to item 303 of regulation sk under the securities exchange act of 1934 additionally we have not entered into any derivative contracts nor do we have any synthetic leases 

the following table represents our future commitments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 

 

  

our longterm debt under contractual obligations above includes interest on the balance outstanding under our variable rate credit facility as of december 31 2006 the 860 million outstanding at december 31 2006 was assumed to remain unpaid until the facility matures on june 1 2010 and interest was computed at the average effective rate of 652 at december 31 2006 

the interest rate on advances under the credit facility our primary debt outstanding may be at our option either the bank prime lending rate on the one hand or the interbank offering rate ibor plus an additional percentage ranging from 875 to 1625 on the other hand the percentage added to ibor is dependent upon our total funded debt to ebitda ratio as defined for the trailing four quarters 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facility where interest rates are tied to either the prime rate or ibor as of december 31 2006 we had 860 million outstanding under our credit facility we do not as a matter of policy enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes based upon our variable rate debt at december 31 2006 a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would result in an annual increase in interest expense of approximately 09 million 

the company is also exposed to currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket parts in taiwan while all transactions with manufacturers based in taiwan are conducted in us dollars changes in the relationship between the us dollar and the new taiwan dollar might impact the purchase price of aftermarket parts we might not be able to pass on any price increases to customers under our present policies we do not attempt to hedge this currency exchange rate exposure 

our investment in our central american operations is not material and we do not attempt to hedge our foreign currency risk related to such operations

 item 1   business

overview 

we provide replacement systems components and parts needed to repair light vehicles cars and light trucks buyers of light vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily three sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers “oems” which are commonly known as oem products new products produced by companies other than the oems which are sometimes referred to generically as “aftermarket” products and recycled products originally produced by oems which we refer to as recycled oem products we participate in the market for recycled oem products as well as the market for collision repair aftermarket products we obtain aftermarket products and salvage vehicles from a variety of sources and we dismantle the salvage vehicles to obtain a comprehensive range of vehicle products that we distribute into the light vehicle repair market we are not involved in the manufacture of automotive products and do not maintain any manufacturing or remanufacturing operations 

we believe we are the largest nationwide provider of recycled oem products and related services with sales processing and distribution facilities that reach most major markets in the us we believe that we are the second largest nationwide provider of aftermarket collision replacement products while we currently service the majority of the major metropolitan areas in the us with both recycled oem and aftermarket products we estimate our current share of the light vehicle recycling market to be less than 10 and our current share of the aftermarket products market to be less than 10 we believe there are opportunities for growth in both product lines through acquisitions and internal development 

we procure salvage vehicles primarily at auctions using our locally based professionals proprietary processes and a disciplined procurement system in addition as an alternative source of salvage vehicles we obtain some inventory directly from insurance companies vehicle manufacturers and other suppliers once we have received proper title which assures us that the vehicles have not been stolen we dismantle such vehicles for recycled oem products we purchase aftermarket products from manufacturers primarily in taiwan using a proprietary order management system 

our customers include collision and mechanical repair shops and indirectly insurance companies including extended warranty companies the majority of our products and services are sold to collision repair shops also known as body shops and mechanical repair shops we indirectly rely on insurance companies which ultimately pay the collision repair shops for the repair of insured vehicles as a source of business these insurance companies exert significant influence in the vehicle repair decision and increasingly look to a nationwide source for consistency quality and availability of replacement products because of their importance to the process we have formed business relationships with certain insurance companies and with certain extended warranty providers in order to be their preferred light vehicle parts supplier for example with some insurance companies we have vehicle repair order estimate review programs in place and provide their claims adjusters a part quote and locator service in addition we provide them an outlet to dispose of certain total loss vehicles directly to us we provide extended warranty companies a single national call desk to service their nationwide needs for mechanical products 

we believe we provide customers a value proposition that includes high quality products extensive product availability due to our regional inventory trading zones product costs lower than new oem products and quick delivery we provide benefits to repair shops and insurance companies because the lower costs for our products enable many vehicles to be repaired rather than declared a total loss by expanding our product offerings to include both recycled oem products and aftermarket products we now offer customers a more extensive range of light vehicle replacement products we believe this unique combination of recycled and aftermarket product offerings allows us to serve as a “onestop” solution for our customers looking for the most cost advantageous way to repair vehicles 

our history 

we believe we were the first recycler of light vehicle products to achieve a national network and presence since our formation in 1998 we have grown through both internal development and acquisitions our acquisition strategy has been to target companies with strategic locations and significant market presence strong management teams a record of environmental compliance solid growth prospects and a reputation for quality and customer service we currently have 65 locations in the us that supply wholesale recycled oem products in february 2004 we expanded our product offerings by also becoming a supplier of aftermarket products and a provider of selfservice retail recycled vehicle products we currently have approximately 45 locations that supply aftermarket products serving 23 states primarily east of the mississippi river and 12 locations providing selfservice retail recycled vehicle products in florida illinois oregon and tennessee on january 31 2006 we acquired transwheel corporation an aluminum alloy wheel refurbishing and distribution business transwheel currently operates refurbishing and distribution facilities in indiana connecticut florida and maryland and distribution facilities in illinois and michigan 

for the year ended december 31 2005 revenue derived from recycled oem products and related services represented approximately 75 of our revenue sales of aftermarket products and services represented approximately 155 of our revenue and sales of other products such as scrap and other bulk products represented approximately 95 of our revenue 

our strengths 

we provide a national solution to insurance companies and extended warranty providers 

we believe that our nationwide presence gives us a unique ability to service the major automobile insurance companies and extended warranty providers insurance companies and extended warranty providers operate generally at a national or regional level and play a critical role in the repair process we believe we provide a direct benefit to these companies by lowering the cost of repairs decreasing the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer and providing a replacement product that is of comparable quality to the part replaced specifically we assist insurance companies by purchasing insured total loss vehicles and by providing cost effective products through sales to collision repair shops especially to repair shops that are part of an insurance company network we also provide a review of vehicle repair order estimates to insurance companies so they may assess the opportunity to increase usage of recycled oem and aftermarket products for extended warranty providers we provide a single national call desk to service their nationwide need for mechanical products 

we believe we have the only national network for recycled oem products and it would be difficult to replicate 

we have invested significant capital developing a national network of recycled oem product facilities that serves most major metropolitan areas in the us we have differentiated ourselves from our local competitors and made replication of our network difficult by developing our network through purchasing anchor companies that were among the largest companies in the industry the difficulty and time required to obtain proper zoning as well as dismantling and other environmental permits necessary to operate newlysited facilities would make establishing new facilities challenging in addition there are difficulties 

associated with recruiting and hiring an experienced management team that has strong industry knowledge and local relationships with customers finally our national network allows us to enter new adjacent markets quickly by establishing redistribution facilities which avoids the need for local dismantling capabilities and inventory 

we benefit from a local presence 

our network of facilities allows us to develop and maintain our relationships with local repair shops while providing a level of service to insurance companies and national customers that is made possible by our nationwide presence our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries that our customers require using drivers who routinely deliver to the same customers our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network 

we have a proven and effective procurement process 

we have designed information systems and methodologies to procure salvage vehicles and aftermarket products costeffectively as our largest single expenditure efficient procurement of salvage vehicles is critical to the growth operating results and cash flow of our business our processes and knowhow allow us to identify and value the parts that can be recycled on a damaged vehicle at auction and to determine rapidly the maximum price we will pay for the vehicle in order to achieve our target margins on resale of the recycled oem products we carefully analyze the market and obtain aftermarket products and salvage vehicles of the type whose parts are in demand at prices that we believe will allow us to sell products profitably we have also taken advantage of our relationships with insurance companies and vehicle manufacturers to obtain salvage vehicles outside the auction process 

we have a broad and deep inventory of products 

we believe that our customers place a high value on availability of a broad range of light vehicle replacement products we also believe that our inventory of both recycled oem and aftermarket products allows us to fill a higher percentage of our customers’ orders than our competitors in addition our ability to share inventory on a regional basis increases the availability of replacement products and also helps us to fill a higher percentage of our customers’ orders we have developed regional trading zones within which we make our inventory available to our local facilities mostly via overnight product transfers we manage our inventory and purchasing on a regional basis to enhance the availability of the products that we believe will be in the highest demand within each region our broad and deep inventory furthers our ability to serve as a “onestop” solution for our customers’ recycled oem and aftermarket product needs 

we have implemented management disciplines 

our management and operations team is highly experienced with many managers having spent their entire careers in the light vehicle recycling industry we have developed and built procurement operating and financial systems that have allowed us to grow and develop our national network and implement professional management techniques and disciplines as our business has grown we have acquired additional management talent which has furthered the sharing of best practices throughout the company in addition our senior management team has extensive acquisition experience and will continue to use our disciplined approach in targeting growth opportunities 

our strategies 

strengthen our national network through internal growth and acquisitions 

we intend to continue to expand our market coverage through a combination of internal development and acquisitions and to look for opportunities to expand into new regions and into adjacent markets we plan to establish a presence in additional major metropolitan markets and a number of smaller markets in 

the us we have applied an analytical and disciplined approach to our acquisition process and have targeted companies with strong management teams a record of environmental compliance solid growth prospects and a reputation for quality and customer service 

further develop business relationships 

we intend to continue to develop business relationships with automobile insurance companies extended warranty providers and other industry participants we believe that insurance companies and extended warranty providers as payors for many repairs will take a more active role in the selection of replacement products in the repair process in order to use lower cost alternatives to new oem products on behalf of certain insurance company customers we provide a review of vehicle repair order estimates so they may assess the opportunity to increase usage of recycled oem and aftermarket products in the repair process thereby reducing their costs our employees also provide quotes for our products to assist several insurance companies with their estimate and settlement processes we also work with insurance companies and vehicle manufacturers to procure salvage vehicles directly from them on a selected basis which provides us an additional source of supply and provides them improved economics on salvage vehicle sales we believe we are positioned to take advantage of the increasing importance of these industry participants and will continue to look for ways to enhance our relationships 

continue to improve our operating results 

we are working to improve our operating results by applying our business disciplines to our most recently acquired facilities continuing to build our network further centralizing certain functions improving our use of technology and increasing revenue at our lower volume facilities our higher volume facilities generally operate at a higher profitability level as a percentage of revenue we believe we can improve the profitability level at our lower volume facilities by achieving the higher volumes and improved economies of scale that we realize at our higher volume facilities we intend to continue to refine our procurement system which uses methodologies that analyze demand levels for our products existing inventory levels and projected margins on an individual vehicle basis 

further develop our technology and business processes 

we continue to emphasize the use of technology in our processes to improve efficiency and to increase the standardization of our business our technology and proprietary processes enhance procurement pricing and inventory management we continue to develop our technology to allow us to better manage and analyze our inventory to assist our sales people with uptodate pricing and availability of our products and to further enhance our procurement process for example many of our representatives responsible for procuring vehicles whom we refer to as “scouts” are equipped with handheld computing devices to assist them in appraising the vehicles prior to submitting a bid to purchase the vehicle additionally we have begun implementing a bar code system that we believe will facilitate improved inventory tracking and management of our recycled products 

raise industry standards by being the industry leader 

since our inception we have employed a professional approach to the light vehicle recycling business we continue to seek new ways to improve our methodologies and to communicate our standards to our customers we further believe that by elevating industry standards in areas such as customer service integrity product quality and availability delivery time warranty support environmental compliance and appearance of facilities we can help promote the acceptability of the use of recycled oem and aftermarket products 

our process 

our operations generally involve the procurement of inventory vehicle processing in the case of wholesale recycled oem products sales and distribution 

procurement of inventory 

we start the process of procuring recycled oem products for our wholesale operations by acquiring severely damaged or totaled vehicles we acquired approximately 97000 salvage vehicles for our wholesale operations in 2005 we purchase the majority of our vehicles from salvage auctions wrecked vehicles are sold at salvage auctions held each weekday throughout the country salvage auctions provide an outlet for salvage vehicles to be processed and sold primarily to automotive recyclers and rebuilders we pay third parties fees to tow the vehicles from the auction to our facilities salvage auctions charge fees both to the supplier of vehicles primarily insurance companies and to the purchaser including us 

for the vast majority of our salvage auction purchases we send a scout in advance of each auction to investigate the vehicles we would be interested in buying the scout obtains key information such as the model mileage and damage assessment and determines which parts on the targeted vehicles are recyclable this information is electronically forwarded to our bid specialists via handheld computing devices or facsimile transmissions the bid specialists analyze the data in light of current demand for the parts in question the levels of our inventory with respect to such parts and the projected margins expected for each vehicle the specialists then set a maximum bid price that our bidders use to purchase the vehicle at auction we believe that this system provides a disciplined approach to procurement 

we also obtain salvage vehicles and parts from insurance companies vehicle manufacturers abandoned vehicle programs and other salvage sources some of these arrangements allow us to acquire salvage vehicles directly from the insurance company or vehicle manufacturer at a cost calculated as a percentage of revenue from such vehicles which is remitted as products are sold from these vehicles these arrangements eliminate the fees we and the insurance company would otherwise pay to the salvage auction and provide us inventory with a lower initial expenditure of capital 

we acquire inventory for our selfservice retail recycled oem products operations from a variety of sources including but not limited to auctions towing companies municipalities insurance carriers charitable organizations and the general public in 2005 we purchased approximately 55800 salvage vehicles for our retail operations 

we purchase aftermarket products from independent manufacturers approximately 90 of the aftermarket products we purchase originate in taiwan we obtain the balance of our aftermarket products from sources in the us no single supplier currently provides more than 21 of our aftermarket products we use a proprietary order management system to procure our aftermarket inventory the system prompts inventory purchases based on stocking levels and historical sales data we believe that the system helps us to procure our aftermarket inventory efficiently and to maintain one of the highest fulfillment rates in the aftermarket products industry 

vehicle processing 

vehicle processing for our wholesale operations involves dismantling a salvage vehicle into recycled oem products ready for delivery when a salvage vehicle arrives at one of our facilities an inventory specialist identifies catalogs and schedules the vehicle for dismantling we do not dismantle any vehicle until we have received proper title documentation thereby assuring that the vehicle was not stolen 

the dismantler removes components that will become products for sale products that are placed directly on inventory shelves generally include such items as the engine transmission hood trunk lid head and tail lamp assemblies rear bumper and doors we remove all recyclable items including fluids freon batteries tires and catalytic converters these items are sold to recyclers and reprocessors dismantlers also perform any required cutting of the vehicle frame or body 

each inventory item is entered into our inventory tracking system inspected for quality tagged for identification and prepared for storage and delivery to our customers mechanical products not in a condition to be sold as recycled products or that are in surplus supply are separated and sold in bulk to 

parts remanufacturers the remaining vehicle hulks and components such as fabrics rubber plastics and glass are delivered to automobile shredders crushers and scrap processors 

sales 

as of december 31 2005 we employed approximately 475 fulltime sales staff in our wholesale recycled oem products operations of these approximately 450 were located at sales desks at our facilities and generally are responsible for accepting incoming calls from and selling our inventory to our customers we put all of our sales personnel through a thorough training program most of our sales personnel are paid primarily on a commission basis in addition as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 25 traveling sales staff who visit our customers and focus on business development in various markets in our aftermarket products operations sales orders are accepted by either our local delivery drivers or by our dedicated aftermarket products sales call center located in columbus ohio 

we are continually reviewing and revising the pricing of our recycled oem products our pricing specialists take into consideration factors such as location recent demand inventory quantity inventory turnover new oem product prices recycled oem product prices aftermarket product prices and remanufactured part prices with the goal of optimizing revenue we update the pricing of our aftermarket products at least annually when we update our product catalog and we may adjust aftermarket prices during the year in response to material price changes of oem products 

the inventory base of each of our facilities supplemented by the inventory sharing system within our regional trading zones gives us what we believe to be a competitive advantage through our ability to meet our customers’ requirements more frequently than smaller competitors 

distribution 

each sale results in the generation of a work order a dispatcher is then responsible for ensuring product accuracy printing the final invoice and including the products on the appropriate truck route for delivery to the customer we operate a delivery fleet of mediumsized trucks and smaller trucks and vans these trucks deliver products to our customers within a specified territory typically on a daily basis in markets where we offer both recycled oem and aftermarket products we deliver both types of products on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs 

additionally we have developed an internal distribution network to allow our sales representatives to sell both recycled oem and aftermarket products from the inventory of nearby facilities within our regional trading zones thus improving our ability to fulfill customer requests and to improve inventory turnover we operate approximately 55 recycled oem product and 26 aftermarket product transfers between our facilities within our regional trading zones each weekday 

our products 

when we procure salvage vehicles we focus on vehicles for which the insured repair market has the most recycled oem product demand these tend to be popular types of vehicles such as sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks and popular models like the accord taurus camry lumina and explorer these vehicles generally are a few model years old as insurers tend to use new oem products on repairs of vehicles that are one to two years old similarly insurers are less likely to authorize the repair of vehicles more than ten model years old the degree of damage is not a significant factor in our process as we only assign value to the undamaged product when we prepare our bids 

our most popular recycled oem products include engines vehicle front end assemblies doors transmissions trunk lids bumper assemblies wheels head and tail lamp assemblies mirrors fenders and axles 

when we obtain a mechanical product from a dismantled vehicle and determine that we have an excess supply of such product or it is defective it is then sold in bulk to mechanical remanufacturers we refer to these items as core products the majority of these products are transferred to our core facility in houston texas where we sort them by product and model type examples of such products are engine blocks and heads transmissions starters alternators and air conditioner compressors 

when we procure aftermarket products we focus on aftermarket products that are in the most demand by the insured repair market our most popular aftermarket products are head lamps tail lamps grilles hoods and mirrors we also focus on aftermarket products that would best complement our recycled oem product inventory 

our customers 

insurance companies 

we consider automobile insurance companies our customers as they are a key demand driver for our products our products are delivered directly to the repair shop or installer because insurance companies and extended warranty providers generally do not take receipt of repair parts while insurance companies do not pay for our products directly the insurance company does ultimately pay for the repair of the insured vehicle as a result the insurance company often exerts significant influence in the decisionmaking process as to how a damaged vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the product used in the repair process insurance companies are also concerned with customer satisfaction with the repair process and the total time to return the repaired vehicle to its owner 

repair shops and others 

we sell the majority of our products wholesale to collision repair shops and mechanical repair shops the majority of these customers tend to be individuallyowned small businesses although over the last few years there has been a trend toward consolidation resulting in the formation of several national and regional repair companies we also sell our products to automobile dealerships and fleet management groups in addition we sell our products to individual retail customers at our selfservice retail locations and at certain of our wholesale recycled oem and aftermarket product locations 

remanufacturers 

a mechanical part that is not suitable for sale as a replacement part or that is a product for which we have an excess supply is sold to mechanical remanufacturers in bulk shipments examples of mechanical parts we sell in this manner are engine blocks and heads transmissions starters alternators and air conditioner compressors remanufacturers usually are significantly larger companies than repair shops our sales to them tend to be large orders and are dependent on their needs for a certain product line 

our employees 

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 3370 employees performing operational functions and approximately 130 corporate and regional employees none of our employees is a member of a union or participates in other collective bargaining arrangements 

our facilities 

our corporate headquarters are located at 120 north lasalle street suite 3300 chicago illinois 60602 in february 2004 we entered into a new lease which became effective on august 1 2004 to remain in our current office space the term of the new lease is ten years but either party can terminate the lease in july 2009 the primary functions performed at our corporate headquarters are financial accounting treasury marketing business development human resources information systems support and legal in 

addition to our corporate headquarters we have numerous operating facilities that handle recycled oem products aftermarket products and selfservice retail products 

recycled oem parts 

our wholesale recycled oem parts facilities are located among eight geographic regions a typical facility has processing sales and distribution operations including a large warehouse with multiple bays to dismantle vehicles indoor and outdoor storage areas and administrative and sales offices equipment typically used at each facility includes hydraulic lifts forklifts and loaders and hand tools to dismantle vehicles we also have facilities that operate primarily as redistribution centers as of march 1 2006 we conducted our wholesale recycled oem parts operations from 65 facilities 52 of which include a combination of processing sales and redistribution operations and 13 of which are primarily redistribution facilities we also have three recycled oem parts facilities in san jose costa rica guatemala city guatemala and xela guatemala 

aftermarket parts 

we conduct our aftermarket parts business from facilities that serve as sales warehousing or distribution centers for these parts as of march 1 2006 we conducted our aftermarket parts operations from approximately 45 facilities the largest of these facilities are located in columbus ohio charlotte north carolina dallas texas oakland california pennsauken new jersey totowa new jersey landover maryland atlanta georgia chicago illinois webster massachusetts and topeka kansas 

selfservice retail parts 

our selfservice retail parts facilities typically consist of several acres of vehicles stored outdoors and a retail building through which customers access the vehicles as of march 1 2006 we conducted our selfservice retail parts operations from 12 facilities in the united states 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry we consider all suppliers of light vehicle products to be competitors including participants in the recycled oem product market oems parts remanufacturers and suppliers of aftermarket products we believe the principal areas of competition in our industry include pricing product quality service and availability of inventory 

we compete with more than 6000 domestic light vehicle product recyclers most of which are singleunit operators we believe most of the light vehicle parts recyclers in the us have less than 30 million in annual revenue in some markets smaller competitors have organized affiliations to share marketing and distribution resources greenleaf llc a light vehicle recycling business started by ford motor company is our largest competitor in the light vehicle oem product recycling business schnitzer steel industries inc a company with operations in the steel manufacturing metals recycling and vehicle product recycling businesses reported that it purchased greenleaf on september 30 2005 schnitzer steel is a significant operator in the selfservice retail recycling business 

we also compete with distributors of aftermarket collision light vehicle products the largest distributor of these products in the us is keystone automotive industries inc 

manufacturers of new original equipment parts sell the majority of light vehicle replacement products we believe however that as the insurance and repair industries come to appreciate the advantages of recycled oem and aftermarket products those products can account for a larger percentage of total vehicle replacement product sales 

information technology 

we use a single third party facility management system in most of our wholesale recycled oem operations we believe that a single system helps us with the continued implementation of standard operating procedures training efficiency employee transferability access to a national inventory database management reporting and data storage it also eliminates the need to create multiple versions of proprietary applications and systems support processes 

the major features of our facility management system include inventory control customer selling and billing sales analysis vehicle tracking and profitability reporting the system also supports an electronic exchange system for identifying and locating parts at other selected recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock 

we have separate third party providers for our financial systems such as financial and budget reporting general ledger accounting accounts payable payroll and fixed assets we utilize the same common financial systems throughout the majority of our operations 

we currently protect our local customer inventory and corporate consolidated data such as financial information email files and other user files with daily backups these backups are stored off site with a third party data protection vendor 

we have consolidated our facility management systems onto regional system platforms the hardware for all such platforms is located at a single data center the center is in a secure environment with aroundtheclock monitoring redundant power backup and multiple diverse data and telecommunication routing facility management system data is “mirrored” replicated off site in real time to a disaster recovery facility located in a different part of the country this disaster recovery facility is also housed in a secure environment with aroundtheclock monitoring redundant power backup and multiple diverse data and telecommunications routing 

currently our aftermarket and selfservice retail operations each use a separate facility management system 

regulation 

environmental compliance 

our operations and properties including the maintenance of our delivery vehicles are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations these environmental laws govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water the exposure to hazardous materials and the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials 

we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters we have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements we cannot assure you however that we will at all times be in complete compliance with such requirements 

although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us we may be required to make such expenditures in the future environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot assure you that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

contamination resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release storage transportation or disposal of gasoline motor oil antifreeze transmission fluid cfcs from air conditioners other hazardous materials or metals such as aluminum cadmium chromium lead and mercury contamination can migrate onsite or offsite which can increase the risk and the amount of any potential liability 

in addition many of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use which may have involved hazardous materials as a result some of our properties may be contaminated some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination even if these owners or operators did not know of and were not responsible for such contamination these environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of treats or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties or successors to such owners or operators for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 

when we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process we analyze the risks and when appropriate perform further environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination furthermore where appropriate we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters in addition at times we or one of the sellers from whom we purchased a business have undertaken remediation projects we do not anticipate based on currently available information and current laws that we will incur liabilities in excess of reserves to address environmental matters however in the event we discover new information or if laws change we may incur significant liabilities which may exceed our reserves

in some states when a vehicle is deemed a total loss a salvage title is issued whether states issue salvage titles is important to the light vehicle recycling industry because an increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles currently these titling issues are a matter of state law in 1992 the us congress commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle titling registration and salvage since then legislation has been introduced seeking to establish national uniform requirements in this area including a uniform definition of a salvage vehicle the light vehicle recycling industry will generally favor a uniform definition since it will avoid inconsistencies across state lines and will generally favor a definition that expands the number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage however certain interest groups including repair shops and some insurance associations may oppose this type of legislation national legislation has not yet been enacted in this area and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in the future 

national stolen passenger motor vehicle information system 

in 1992 congress enacted the anti car theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles this law included the establishment of the national stolen passenger motor vehicle information system to track and monitor stolen automotive parts in april 2002 the department of justice published for comment proposed regulations to implement the national stolen passenger motor vehicle information system the proposed regulations require among other things that insurance companies salvagers dismantlers recyclers and repairers inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the vehicle identification number and the part number for any “covered major part” that possesses the vehicle identification number the requirement to collect this information would place substantial burdens on light vehicle recyclers including us that otherwise would not normally exist it would place similar burdens on repair 

shops which may further discourage the use by such shops of recycled products the department of justice’s comment period for the proposed regulations ended in june 2002 but final regulations have not been issued 

legislation affecting automotive repair parts 

most states have laws that restrict the use of aftermarket parts in collision repair work these restrictions range from the requirement to disclose to the vehicle owner the use of aftermarket parts in the repair process to the requirement to have aftermarket parts certified by an independent testing organization some jurisdictions have laws that prohibit or restrict the sale of certain recycled oem products that we provide such as airbags additional laws of this kind may be introduced in the future an increase in the number of states passing such legislation or the passing of legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on our business additionally congress could enact federal legislation restricting the use of aftermarket and recycled automotive parts in the repair process 




 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

we face intense competition from local national and internetbased light vehicle products providers and this competition could negatively affect our business 

the light vehicle replacement products industry is highly competitive and is served by numerous suppliers of oem products recycled oem products and aftermarket products within each of these categories of suppliers there are local owneroperated companies larger regional suppliers national providers and internetbased suppliers providers of light vehicle replacement products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of light vehicle replacement products which may further increase competition some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise greater financial technical manufacturing distribution and other resources longer operating histories lower cost structures and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries in certain regions of the us local light vehicle recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in the recycled oem products industry as a result of these factors our competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply provide their products at lower costs or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve 

an adverse change in our relationships with auction companies or our suppliers could increase our expenses and hurt our relationships with our customers 

most of our salvage inventory consists of vehicles offered at salvage auctions by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the us we do not have contracts with any auction company according to industry analysts three companies control over 50 of the salvage auction market in the us in some localities the automotive auction business may be even more highly concentrated if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions or significantly raised its fees our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers moreover auction companies have begun to allow bids to be submitted on salvage vehicles through the internet which increases the number of potential bidders and may increase our cost of goods sold for recycled oem products 

we also acquire some of our inventory directly from insurance companies original equipment manufacturers aftermarket parts manufacturers and others to the extent that these suppliers decide to 

discontinue these arrangements our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers 

in addition we purchase aftermarket parts primarily from foreign manufacturers in taiwan in the event that our business relationships with these suppliers deteriorated or terminated or in the event that the importing of products into the us from taiwan or the exporting of products by taiwan to the us was disrupted our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting inability to service our customers 

we may not be able to sell our products due to existing or new laws and regulations prohibiting or restricting the sale of recycled oem or aftermarket products 

some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled oem products that we provide such as airbags these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled oem products restrictions on the products we are able to sell could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

we became involved in the aftermarket products business upon the closing of an acquisition in february 2004 since 1998 most states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair work andor require enhanced disclosure or vehicle owner consent before using aftermarket products in such repair work additional bills of this kind may be introduced in the future if additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business 

certain organizations test the quality and safety of light vehicle replacement products in the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product such events could adversely affect our business 

if our business relationships with insurance companies end we may lose important sales opportunities 

we rely on business relationships with certain insurance companies these insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide our arrangements with these companies may be terminated at any time we rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things 

·   the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water

·   the exposure to hazardous materials and

·   the generation handling storage use treatment identification transportation and disposal of industrial byproducts waste water storm water and mercury and other hazardous materials

we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also become liable if employees or other third parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials 

under certain environmental laws we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at or migration to or from our or our predecessors’ past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or was not responsible for the release of such hazardous substances 

environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits 

our operating subsidiaries must receive certain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations when we develop or acquire a new facility we must seek the approval of state and local units of government governmental agencies often resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling facility in their communities there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold 

proposed regulations under the national stolen passenger motor vehicle information system could harm our business 

in 1992 congress enacted the anti car theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles this law included the establishment of the national stolen passenger motor vehicle information system to track and monitor stolen automotive parts in april 2002 the department of justice published for comment proposed regulations to implement this system the proposed regulations require among other things that insurance companies salvagers dismantlers recyclers and repairers inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the vehicle identification number and the part number for any covered major part that possesses the vehicle identification number the requirement to collect this information would place burdens and costs on us that otherwise would not normally exist and could discourage our customers from purchasing our products if the proposed regulations are adopted 

we could be subject to product liability claims 

if customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage we could be subject to product liability claims the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business or financial condition 

we may lose business if recent litigation involving the use of aftermarket parts results in insurance companies modifying arrangements affecting the use of recycled oem or aftermarket products in the repair process 

in an illinois lawsuit involving state farm mutual automobile insurance company  “avery v state farm”  a jury decided in october 1999 that state farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using nonoem parts to repair damaged vehicles when use of such parts did not restore the vehicle to its “preloss condition” the jury found that state farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of nonoem parts and the alleged inferiority of those parts the jury assessed damages against state farm of 456 million and the judge assessed an additional 730 million of disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the illinois consumer fraud act in april 2001 the illinois appellate court upheld the verdict but reduced the damage award by 130 million because of duplicative damage awards on august 18 2005 the illinois supreme court reversed the awards made by the circuit court and found among other things that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any breach of contract on the part of state farm as a result of this case some insurance companies had reduced or eliminated their use of 

aftermarket products although our products are primarily recycled oem parts we entered the aftermarket products business through an acquisition in february 2004 because the decision by the illinois supreme court was rendered so recently we are uncertain how the decision will affect the practices of insurance companies in the future but our financial results could be affected perhaps adversely if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled oem products from us due to a fear of similar claims with respect to such products 

if the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines our business could suffer 

because our business depends on vehicle accidents for both the supply of recycled oem products and the demand for repairs using our products factors which influence the number andor severity of accidents including but not limited to the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven the ages of drivers the use of cellular telephones and other electronic equipment by drivers the congestion of traffic the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers and the condition of roadways impact our business in this regard a number of states and municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones while driving and such restrictions could lead to a decline in accidents moreover rising fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road to decline as motorists seek alternative transportation options and this also could lead to a decline in accidents 

we may not be able to successfully acquire new operations or integrate future acquisitions which could cause our business to suffer 

we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms or for other reasons if we buy a company or a division of a company we may experience difficulty integrating that company’s or division’s personnel and operations which could negatively affect our operating results in addition 

·   the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us

·   we may experience business disruptions as a result of information technology systems conversions

·   we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning treasury management and financial reporting

·   we may be held liable for environmental risks and liabilities as a result of our acquisitions some of which we may not have discovered during our due diligence

·   our ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention and

·   we may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated

in connection with future acquisitions we may assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire these liabilities including liabilities for environmentalrelated costs could materially and adversely affect our business we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition the issuance of which could involve the imposition of restrictive covenants or be dilutive to our existing stockholders 

our credit facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and requires us to meet certain financial tests 

our credit facility contains certain operating and financial restrictions that limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions including the following 

·   incurring or guarantying additional debt

·   paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming repurchasing or retiring our capital stock or subordinated obligations

·   making investments and capital expenditures

·   creating liens on our assets

·   selling transferring leasing licensing or otherwise disposing of assets other than in the ordinary course of business

·   engaging in transactions with stockholders and affiliates

·   engaging in mergers consolidations or acquisitions

·   engaging in any material line of business substantially different from and unrelated to those lines of business currently carried on by us and

·   making changes to our equity capital structure or amending our certificate of incorporation bylaws or any stockholder rights agreement

the credit facility also requires that we satisfy certain financial tests the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit facility a default if not waived could result in acceleration of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing credit facility or it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 

our future capital needs may require that we seek debt financing or additional equity funding that if not available could cause our business to suffer 

we may need to raise additional funds in the future to among other things fund our existing operations improve or expand our operations respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions from time to time we may raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic alliances or other arrangements if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to further limitations on our operations if we fail to raise capital when needed our business will be negatively affected 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control future factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the following 

·   fluctuations in the pricing of new oem replacement products

·   the availability and cost of inventory

·   variations in vehicle accident rates

·   competition in the vehicle replacement parts industry

·   changes in state or federal laws or regulations affecting our business

·   changes in the types of replacement parts that insurance carriers will accept in the repair process

·   our ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully

·   fluctuations in fuel prices

·   changes in the demand for our products and the supply of our inventory due to severity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns

·   the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business operations and infrastructure and

·   declines in the values of our assets

due to the foregoing factors our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate accordingly our results of operations may not be indicative of future performance these fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to decline 

if we lose our key management personnel we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives if we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel which could harm our business 

we rely on information technology in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business 

we use information technology systems owned by other companies for management of our facilities and our financial functions in the event that the providers of these systems terminate their relationships with us we could suffer disruptions to our operations 

in addition we continually monitor these systems to find areas for improvement in the event that we decided to switch providers or to implement our own systems we may also suffer disruptions to our 

business we may be unsuccessful if we try to develop our own systems and we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing our own systems also our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system which period could extend longer than we anticipated 

if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks our business could be harmed 

we use a fleet of trucks to deliver the majority of the products we sell we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in the transportation infrastructure availability and price of fuel liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance and insurance premium increases in addition our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur significant charges to our pretax income 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations in the future goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of future acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed at least annually for impairment impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business as of december 31 2005 our total goodwill subject to future impairment testing was approximately 1818 million 

challenges to the validity of aftermarket products could adversely effect our business 

original equipment manufacturers have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims the original equipment manufacturers have brought such claims in federal court and with the united states international trade commission to the extent that the original equipment manufacturers are successful with these claims we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business 

risks relating to our common stock 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other stockholders 

as of december 31 2005 our executive officers directors and their affiliates in the aggregate beneficially owned approximately 21 of our common stock if they were to act together these stockholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by stockholders including the election of directors any amendments to our certificate of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions these stockholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other stockholders in addition without the consent of these stockholders we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that may be viewed as beneficial to us or our other stockholders 

future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 

we and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock in the future we may also issue shares of common stock in connection with the exercise of outstanding options or in connection with future acquisitions certain of our existing stockholders are parties to a registration rights agreement that provides such holders with the right to require us to effect the registration of their shares of common stock 

in specific circumstances in addition if we propose to register any of our common stock under the securities act of 1933 whether for our own account or otherwise some existing stockholders may be entitled to include their shares of common stock in that registration we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued in connection with an acquisition or the perception that such sales could occur may cause the price of our common stock to fall 

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover which could affect the price of our stock 

the antitakeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could together or separately impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult our incorporation under delaware law and these provisions could also impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquiror from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the price of our common stock

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview 

we provide replacement systems components and parts needed to repair light vehicles cars and light trucks buyers of light vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily three sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers “oems” which are commonly known as oem products new products produced by companies other than the oems which are sometimes referred to generically as “aftermarket” products and recycled products originally produced by oems which we refer to as recycled oem products we participate in the market for recycled oem products as well as the market for collision repair aftermarket products we obtain aftermarket products and salvage vehicles from a variety of sources and we dismantle the salvage vehicles to obtain a comprehensive range of vehicle products that we distribute into the light vehicle repair market we are not involved in the manufacture of automotive products and do not maintain any manufacturing or remanufacturing operations 

our revenue cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors some of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to 

·   fluctuations in the pricing of new oem replacement products

·   the availability and cost of inventory

·   variations in vehicle accident rates

·   competition in the vehicle replacement parts industry

·   changes in state or federal laws or regulations affecting our business

·   changes in the types of replacement parts that insurance carriers will accept in the repair process

·   our ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully

·   fluctuations in fuel prices

·   changes in the demand for our products and the supply of our inventory due to severity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns

·   the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business operations and infrastructure and

·   declines in the value of our assets

due to the foregoing factors our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate accordingly our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance 

acquisitions 

since our inception in 1998 we have pursued a growth strategy of both organic growth and acquisitions we have pursued acquisitions that we believe will help drive profitability cash flow and stockholder value our principal focus for acquisitions is companies that will expand our geographic presence and our ability to provide a wider choice of alternative light vehicle replacement products and services to our customers 

during 2003 we acquired three automotive recycling businesses located in upstate new york california and nevada respectively for an aggregate of approximately 33 million in cash 02 million in notes issued and 100000 redeemable shares of our common stock these business acquisitions enabled us to serve new market areas 

during 2004 we acquired six businesses five in the recycled oem automotive parts business and one in the aftermarket automotive parts business for an aggregate of approximately 617 million in cash 24 million in notes issued and 373396 shares of our common stock these business acquisitions enabled us to serve new markets expand our presence in certain markets become a significant provider of aftermarket automotive replacement parts and become a provider of selfservice retail automotive parts one of the acquisitions had operations in guatemala and costa rica the revenue of the central american businesses is not material but we are using these facilities as a platform to sell certain types of products into central america from our us based recycled oem automotive replacement parts facilities 

during 2005 we acquired eight businesses four in the recycled oem automotive parts business and four in the aftermarket automotive parts business for an aggregate of approximately 1052 million in cash 64 million in notes issued and 9 million contingently payable based on the achievement of certain future financial results these business acquisitions enabled us to serve new markets and expand our presence in existing markets 

in the first quarter of 2006 we completed an acquisition in the wheel refurbishment and distribution business with four locations for the refurbishment and distribution of wheels and two additional distribution locations this acquisition allows us to expand our product offerings to our customers we also acquired three recycled oem automotive parts businesses two in the selfserve retail business in the first quarter these business acquisitions enable us to expand our presence in existing markets and serve new market areas 

sources of revenue 

since 2003 our revenue from the sale of light vehicle replacement products and related services has ranged between 90 and 93 of our total revenue we sell the majority of our light vehicle replacement products to collision repair shops and mechanical repair shops our light vehicle replacement products include for example engines transmissions frontends doors trunk lids bumpers hoods fenders grilles valances headlights and taillights we sell extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products these contracts cover the cost of parts and labor and are sold for periods of six months one year or two years we defer the revenue from such contracts and recognize it ratably over the term of the contracts the demand for our products and services is influenced by several factors including the number of vehicles in operation the number of miles being driven the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents availability and pricing of new parts seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions additionally automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process accordingly we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our products we provide insurance companies services that include the review of vehicle repair order estimates as well as direct quotation services to their adjusters there is no standard price for recycled oem products but rather a pricing structure that varies from daytoday based upon such factors as product availability quality demand new oem replacement product prices the age of the vehicle being repaired and competitor pricing the pricing for aftermarket products is determined based on a number of factors including availability quality demand new oem replacement product prices and competitor pricing 

since 2003 approximately 7 to 10 of our revenue has been obtained from other sources these include bulk sales to mechanical remanufacturers scrap sales and sales of damaged vehicles that we sell to vehicle repairers 

when we obtain mechanical products from dismantled vehicles and determine they are damaged or when we have a surplus of a certain mechanical product type we sell them in bulk to mechanical remanufacturers the majority of these products are sorted by product type and model type examples of such products are engine blocks and heads transmissions starters alternators and air conditioner compressors after we have recovered all the products we intend to resell the remaining materials are crushed and sold to scrap processors 

cost of goods sold 

our cost of goods sold for recycled oem products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and where applicable auction storage and towing fees our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles since 2003 our labor and laborrelated costs related to acquisition and dismantling have accounted for approximately 10 of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle the acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and as a result energy costs are not material 

our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts freight and other inventoried costs such as other costs to acquire including import fees and duties where applicable our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors located primarily overseas with the majority of our overseas vendors located in taiwan 

in the event we do not have a recycled oem product or suitable aftermarket product in our inventory we attempt to purchase the part from a competitor we refer to these parts as brokered products since 2003 the revenue from brokered products that we sell to our customers has ranged from 7 to 10 of our total revenue the gross margin on brokered product sales as a percentage of revenue is generally less than half of what we achieve from sales of our own inventory because we must pay higher prices for these products 

some of our mechanical products are sold with a standard sixmonth warranty against defects we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claim information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses our warranty activity during 2004 and 2005 was as follows in thousands 

 

  

we also sell separately priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products the expense related to extended warranty claims is recognized when the claim is made 

expenses 

our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our processing redistribution selfservice and warehouse facilities these costs include labor for both plant management and facility and warehouse personnel facility rent property and liability insurance utilities and other occupancy costs 

our distribution expenses primarily include our costs to deliver our products to our customers included in our distribution expense category are labor costs for drivers local delivery and transfer truck rentals and subcontractor costs vehicle repairs and maintenance insurance and fuel 

our selling and marketing expenses primarily include our advertising promotion and marketing costs salary and commission expenses for sales personnel sales training telephone and other communication expenses and bad debt expense since 2003 personnel costs have accounted for approximately 80 of our selling and marketing expenses most of our recycled oem product sales personnel are paid on a commission basis the number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our customers’ needs and increase our sales volume our objective is to continually evaluate our sales force develop and implement training programs and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness 

our general and administrative expenses include primarily the costs of our corporate and regional offices that provide corporate and field management treasury accounting legal payroll business development human resources and information systems functions 

seasonality 

our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather related accidents in addition the cost of salvage vehicles tends to be lower as more weather related accidents occur generating a larger supply of total loss vehicles 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition warranty costs inventory valuation allowance for doubtful accounts goodwill impairments selfinsurance programs contingencies asset impairments and taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue actual results may differ from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize and report revenue from the sale of light vehicle replacement products when they are shipped and title has transferred subject to a reserve for returns discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information a replacement product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment our customers may earn discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment we analyze historical returns and allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates we use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold 

we also sell separately priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products revenue from these contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the contracts 

warranty reserves 

we issue a standard sixmonth warranty against defects on some of our mechanical products we record an accrual for standard warranty claims at the time of sale using historical warranty claim information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses we analyze historical warranty claim activity by referencing the claims made and aging them from the original product sale date we use this information to project future warranty claims on actual products sold that are still under warranty at the end of an accounting period a 10 increase in our historical 2005 annual warranty claims would result in an additional annual expense of approximately 02 million 

inventory accounting 

salvage inventory salvage inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle and includes buying dismantling and where applicable auction storage and towing fees inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facility’s inventory at expected selling prices the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility’s historical vehicle profitability for salvage vehicles purchased at auction or from contracted rates for salvage vehicles acquired under direct procurement arrangements 

aftermarket inventory aftermarket inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market our aftermarket inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for parts and includes expenses incurred for freight and buying where applicable for items purchased from foreign sources import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included 

for all inventory our carrying value is reduced regularly to reflect the age and current anticipated demand for our products if actual demand differs from our estimates additional reductions to our inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts the aging of the accounts receivable and our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts at december 31 2005 was approximately 21 million which represents 50 of gross receivables if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts may be insufficient to cover the uncollectible receivables which would have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence a 10 change in the 2005 annual writeoff rate would result in a change in the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately 02 million our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable is limited because we have a large number of small customers that are generally geographically dispersed we control credit risk through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring policies we also have certain customers that pay for products at the time of delivery 

goodwill impairment 

we record goodwill as a result of our acquisitions statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which we refer to as sfas 142 requires us to analyze our goodwill for impairment at least annually the determination of the value of goodwill requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events may indicate that 

an impairment exists in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill 

we utilize outside professionals in the valuation industry to validate our assumptions and overall methodology used to determine the fair value estimates used in our goodwill impairment testing as of december 31 2005 we had 1818 million in goodwill subject to future impairment tests if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments in future periods we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results we determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2005 2004 and 2003 a 10 decrease in the fair value estimates used in the fourth quarter of 2005 impairment test would not have changed this determination 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable if our review indicates that the carrying value of longlived assets is not recoverable we reduce the carrying amount of the assets to fair value we have had no adjustments to the carrying value of longlived assets in 2005 2004 or 2003 

selfinsurance programs 

we selfinsure a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program we also selfinsure a portion of automobile general liability and workers’ compensation claims we have purchased stoploss insurance coverage that limits our exposure to both individual claims as well as our overall claims the cost of the stoploss insurance is expensed over the contract periods 

we record an accrual for the claims expense related to our employee medical benefits automobile general liability and workers’ compensation claims based upon the expected amount of all such claims if actual claims are higher than what we anticipated our accrual might be insufficient to cover our claims costs which would have an adverse impact on our operating results in that period if we were to incur claims up to our aggregate stoploss insurance coverage during the open policy years we would have an additional expense of approximately 89 million 

contingencies 

we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business resulting from litigation claims and other commitments and from a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies we accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we determine the amount of reserves if any with the assistance of our outside legal counsel we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether the accruals should be adjusted if the amount of an actual loss were greater than the amount we have accrued the excess loss would have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period that the loss occurred if the loss contingency is subsequently determined to no longer be probable the amount of loss contingency previously accrued would be included in our operating results in the period such determination was made 

accounting for income taxes 

all income tax amounts reflect the use of the liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions with different tax rates and we determine the allocation of income to 

each of these jurisdictions based upon various estimates and assumptions in the normal course of business we will undergo tax audits by various tax jurisdictions such audits often require an extended period of time to complete and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates although we have recorded all probable income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” and sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” these accruals represent estimates that are subject to the inherent uncertainties associated with the tax audit process and therefore include contingencies 

we record a provision for taxes based upon our expected annual effective income tax rate we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we expect is more likely than not to be realized we consider historical taxable income expectations and risks associated with our estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we had a valuation allowance of 02 million 05 million and 07 million at december 31 2003 and 2004 and 2005 respectively against our deferred tax assets should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made conversely should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” “sfas 151” sfas 151 amends arb 43 chapter 4 to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted materials spoilage must be recognized as current period charges it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities sfas 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we do not expect sfas 151 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” a revision of sfas 123 sfas 123r supersedes accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and amends sfas 95 “statement of cash flows” under the standard companies will no longer be able to account for stockbased employee compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb no 25 instead sfas 123r requires the adoption of a fairvalue method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation sfas 123r is effective for us as of january 1 2006 we have historically accounted for stockbased compensation to employees under apb no 25’s intrinsic value method and accordingly have generally not recognized compensation expense for options granted to employees we will adopt the provisions of sfas 123r using the modified prospective method in which prior periods are not restated and compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized prospectively based upon the requirements of sfas 123r and compensation expense for all unvested sharebased payments as of january 1 2006 that were issued subsequent to our initial public offering in october 2003 is recognized prospectively based on sfas 123 in applying the fair value concepts of sfas 123r we will be required to choose among alternative valuation models and other assumptions our current estimates concerning 2006 indicate we will recognize equitybased compensation expense of approximately 003 per diluted share this amount is subject to revisions as we finalize our assumptions including the amount of future awards and forfeiture rates sfas 123r also requires us to calculate the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies that arise subsequent to adopting sfas 123r the “apic pool” we are currently evaluating the acceptable methods for calculating our apic pool sfas 123r further requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of 

recognized book compensation expense be reported as a financing cash flow item as opposed to an operating cash flow item we cannot estimate what the future tax benefits will be as the amounts depend on among other things future employee stock option exercises and the price of our stock if and when such exercises occur 

in march 2005 the fasb issued interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirements—an interpretation of sfas no 143” “fin 47” fin 47 clarifies that uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the obligation we have adopted fin 47 and its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” “sfas 154” sfas 154 replaces accounting principles board opinion no 20 “accounting changes” and sfas no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statementsan amendment of apb opinion no 28” sfas 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections sfas 154 requires “retrospective application” of the direct effect of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior periods’ financial statements where it is practicable to do so sfas 154 also redefines the term “restatement” to mean the correction of an error by revising previously issued financial statements sfas 154 is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 unless adopted early we do not expect the adoption of sfas 154 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows except to the extent that the statement subsequently requires retrospective application of a future item 

segment reporting 

over 99 of our operations are conducted in the us during 2004 we acquired a recycled oem products business with locations in guatemala and costa rica revenue generated and properties located outside of the us are not material we manage our operations geographically our light vehicle replacement products operations are organized into nine operating segments eight for recycled oem products and one for aftermarket products these segments are aggregated into one reportable segment because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services customers and methods of distribution our light vehicle replacement products operations account for over 90 of our revenue earnings and assets

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of ongoing liquidity are cash flow from our operations and our credit facility at december 31 2005 we had cash and equivalents amounting to 32 million and we had 380 million outstanding under our 135 million unsecured bank credit facility we generated 375 million in cash flow from operating activities in 2005 and based on our current plans we expect to generate positive cash flow from operating activities for 2006 we believe that cash flow from operating activities and availability under our credit facility will be adequate to fund our short term liquidity needs 

our liquidity needs are primarily to fund working capital requirements and expand our facilities and network the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under some direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles we normally pay for aftermarket parts purchases at the time of shipment or on standard payment terms depending on the manufacturer and payment options offered we acquired approximately 75000 85000 and 97000 wholesale salvage vehicles in 2003 2004 and 2005 respectively in addition we acquired approximately 27700 and 55800 salvage vehicles for our selfservice retail operations in 2004 and 2005 respectively our purchases of aftermarket parts totaled approximately 234 million and 452 million in 2004 and 2005 respectively 

we completed the sale of 64 million shares of our common stock at a price of 1450 per share in a public offering in october 2005 as adjusted for our january 2006 twoforone stock split this resulted in approximately 879 million of cash proceeds to us net of underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses of the offering in connection with the offering certain members of management exercised stock options to purchase 600000 shares of our common stock resulting in approximately 21 million of proceeds to us we used all of the proceeds from the offering and the option exercises to pay down our then outstanding bank debt and invested the remaining proceeds in short term cash equivalents until we 

used them for general corporate purposes which included three acquisitions completed by the end of the year 

we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of redistribution centers processing facilities and aftermarket warehouses through further integration of aftermarket and recycled oem product facilities and through selected business acquisitions our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 375 million in 2005 compared to 259 million in 2004 cash was provided by net income adjusted for noncash items working capital uses of cash included increases in receivables and inventory and decreases in accounts payable partially offset by increases in escrow liabilities accruals and income taxes payable receivables increased due to our increased sales volume partially offset by repayments of employee relocation loans and other receivables inventory increased to support our increased volume and to add aftermarket products to some of our wholesale recycled salvage locations accounts payable decreased as we accelerated payments to certain foreign vendors in order to realize improved pricing on certain aftermarket product purchases escrow liabilities increased as a result of the deposit in escrow with us of 26 million in cash as collateral in connection with an acquisition by us accrued liabilities increased primarily due to the timing of wage payments higher incentive compensation accruals and higher selfinsurance reserves for workers’ compensation and auto liability claims income taxes payable increased primarily due to higher levels of taxable income 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1260 million in 2005 compared to 878 million in 2004 we invested 1038 million of cash in eight acquisitions in 2005 compared to 616 million in six acquisitions in 2004 we received 26 million in proceeds from the escrow deposit we also realized 07 million in increased proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and 04 million from the sale of investment securities in 2005 

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 900 million in 2005 compared to 475 million in 2004 included in 2005 net cash amounts is 879 million from the sale of 64 million shares of common stock in a public offering exercises of stock options and warrants totaled 118 million in 2005 and 49 million in 2004 in addition we had net repayments of 90 million under our credit facility in 2005 compared to net borrowings of 470 million in 2004 repayments of longterm debt obligations decreased 39 million in 2005 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 259 million in 2004 compared to 209 million in 2003 cash was provided by net income adjusted for noncash items working capital uses of cash included increases in receivables and inventory plus decreases in accounts payable and other noncurrent liabilities partially offset by decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets plus increases in accrued expenses income taxes payable and deferred revenue receivables increased due to our increased sales volume and increases of 06 million for employee relocation loans inventory increased to support our increased volume accounts payable decreased as we accelerated payments to certain foreign vendors in order to realize improved pricing on certain aftermarket product purchases and also due to the timing of payments for certain facility construction projects and information systems licenses other noncurrent liabilities decreased primarily due to reductions in legal claim reserves partially offset by an increase in employee deferred compensation liabilities prepaid expenses and other assets decreased due primarily to amortization of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation plan assets and cash paid in connection with the exercise of a warrant net of decreases in that investment’s value subsequent to acquisition accrued expenses increased primarily due to increases in our selfinsurance reserves property taxes and timing of wage payments income taxes payable increased due primarily to our higher levels of taxable income deferred revenue increased primarily due to higher sales of extended warranty contracts 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 878 million in 2004 compared to 122 million in 2003 we invested 616 million of cash in six acquisitions in 2004 compared to 33 million in three acquisitions in 2003 while net property and equipment purchases increased 166 million due primarily to exercises of purchase options on previously leased facilities and investments in facility expansions and information systems we also exercised a warrant and paid an exercise price of 07 million in 2004 see note 1 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further discussion of this investment 

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 475 million in 2004 compared to 68 million in 2003 included in these net cash amounts are 49 million in 2004 from the exercises of stock options and warrants and 600 million in 2003 from the sale of shares in our initial public offering and exercises of stock options and warrants in addition we borrowed 470 million under our credit facility in 2004 primarily to fund acquisitions compared to net repayments of 298 million in 2003 repayments of longterm debt obligations increased 38 million in 2004 we also incurred 02 million in 2004 for debt issuance costs related to our new unsecured credit facility compared to 01 million in 2003 in 2003 we repurchased 3557498 shares of our common stock for 229 million 

on february 17 2004 we entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility that originally matured in february 2007 replacing a secured credit facility that would have expired on june 30 2005 the new credit facility initially had a maximum availability of 750 million which was amended to 100 million on january 31 2005 on june 1 2005 the agreement was further amended to increase the maximum availability to 135 million extend the maturity date to june 1 2010 and modify certain other terms in order to make any borrowing under the credit facility after giving effect to any such borrowing we must be in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit facility including without limitation a senior debt to ebitda ratio which cannot exceed 300 to 100 the credit facility contains customary covenants including among other things limitations on payment of cash dividends restrictions on our payment of other dividends and on purchases redemptions and acquisitions of our stock limitations on additional indebtedness certain limitations on acquisitions mergers and consolidations and the maintenance of certain financial ratios we were in compliance with all covenants throughout all of 2005 and 2004 the interest rate on advances under the credit facility may be at our option either the bank prime lending rate on the one hand or the interbank offering rate ibor plus an additional percentage ranging from 875 to 1625 on the other hand the percentage added to ibor is dependent upon our total funded debt to ebitda ratio for the trailing four quarters 

we may in the future borrow additional amounts under our credit facility or enter into new or additional borrowing arrangements we anticipate that any proceeds from such new or additional borrowing arrangements will be used for general corporate purposes including to develop and acquire businesses and redistribution facilities to further the integration of our aftermarket wheel refurbishing and recycled oem product facilities to expand and improve existing facilities to purchase property equipment and inventory and for working capital 

during august 2002 as required by our credit facility we entered into a twoyear interest rate swap agreement with a total notional amount of 100 million and a fixed rate of 265 the counterparty to the agreement was a member of our bank group this swap agreement expired on august 22 2004 under the terms of the agreement we were required to make quarterly payments at the specified fixed rate and in return received payments at variable rates the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap was a loss of 01 million at december 31 2003 and a gain of 01 million at december 31 2004 in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are included in current period earnings as the agreement had not been designated as a hedging instrument 

during 2004 as part of the consideration for business acquisitions completed during the year we issued promissory notes totaling approximately 24 million the notes bear interest at annual rates of 30 to 50 and interest is payable at maturity one of these notes for 10 million is secured by certain real property that we acquired in the acquisition we also assumed certain liabilities in connection with a business acquisition which included two bankers acceptances totaling 115 million which were fully paid in the second quarter of 2004 

during 2005 as part of the consideration for business acquisitions completed during the year we issued promissory notes totaling approximately 64 million the notes bear interest at annual rates of 30 to 35 and interest is payable at maturity we also assumed certain liabilities in connection with a business acquisition which included a promissory note with a remaining principal balance of 02 million the annual interest rate on that note is 50 

we estimate that our capital expenditures for 2006 will be approximately 330 million excluding business acquisitions we expect to use these funds for four major facility expansions improvement of current facilities consolidation of two wholesale recycling operations and conversion of one to a selfservice operation real estate acquisitions and systems development projects we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 will be approximately 400 million 

we believe that our current cash and equivalents cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements however we may from time to time raise additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements there can be no assurance that additional funding or refinancing of our credit facility if needed will be available on terms attractive to us or at all furthermore any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

offbalance sheet arrangements and future commitments 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to item 303 of regulation sk under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended additionally we have not entered into any derivative contracts other than our interest rate swap agreement discussed above that expired in august 2004 nor do we have any synthetic leases 

the following table represents our future commitments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 

 

  

our longterm debt under contractual obligations above includes interest on the balance outstanding under our variable rate credit facility as of december 31 2005 the 380 million outstanding at december 31 2005 was assumed to remain unpaid until the facility matures on june 1 2010 and interest was computed at the average effective rate of 725 at december 31 2005 the 380 million balance 

outstanding at december 31 2005 was converted to an iborbased loan at a rate of 5415 on january 4 2006 

the interest rate on advances under the credit facility our primary debt outstanding may be at our option either the bank prime lending rate on the one hand or the interbank offering rate ibor plus an additional percentage ranging from 875 to 1625 on the other hand the percentage added to ibor is dependent upon our total funded debt to ebitda ratio as defined for the trailing four quarters 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facility where interest rates are tied to either the prime rate or ibor as of december 31 2005 we had 380 million outstanding under our credit facility our previous secured credit facility required that we enter into an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate our interest rate risk on a portion of the balance outstanding we do not however as a matter of policy enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes the swap agreement which expired on august 22 2004 had a notional amount of 100 million under which we paid a fixed rate of interest of 265 and received payments based upon variable rates the swap agreement was not designated as a hedging instrument and as a result changes in the fair value of the swap agreement were included in current period earnings we recorded noncash credits of 69000 and 90000 during 2003 and 2004 respectively related to the change in fair value of the interest rate swap agreement 

based upon our variable rate debt at december 31 2005 a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would result in an annual increase in interest expense of approximately 04 million 

the company is also exposed to currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket parts in taiwan while all transactions with manufacturers based in taiwan are conducted in us dollars changes in the relationship between the us dollar and the new taiwan dollar might impact the purchase price of aftermarket parts we might not be able to pass on any price increases to customers under our present policies we do not attempt to hedge this currency exchange rate exposure 

our investment in our central american operations is not material and we do not attempt to hedge our foreign currency risk related to such operations
