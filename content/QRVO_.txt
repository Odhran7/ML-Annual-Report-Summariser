for a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business see below 

risks related to our business and industry 

our operating results fluctuate 

our revenue earnings margins and other operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future if demand for our products fluctuates as a result of economic conditions or for other reasons our revenue and profitability could be impacted our future operating results will depend on many factors including the following 

• business and macroeconomic changes including trade restrictions and recession or slowing growth in the semiconductor industry and the overall global economy 

• political andor civil unrest acts of war or other military actions including any resulting sanctions or other restrictive actions 

• changes in consumer confidence caused by many factors including changes in interest rates credit markets unemployment levels energy or other commodity prices as well as changes in existing and expected rates of inflation 

• fluctuations in demand for our customers’ products 

• our ability to forecast our customers’ demand for our products accurately 

• the ability of thirdparty foundries and other thirdparty suppliers to manufacture assemble and test our products and otherwise deliver on their commitments to us in a timely and costeffective manner 

• our customers’ and distributors’ ability to manage the inventory that they hold and to forecast accurately their demand for our products 

• delays in the widespread deployment of commercial 5g networks or in consumer adoption of 5genabled devices 

• our ability to achieve cost savings and improve yields and margins on our new and existing products 

• our ability to successfully integrate into our business and realize the expected benefits of our acquisitions and strategic investments and 

• our ability to utilize our capacity efficiently or to acquire additional capacity in response to customer demand 

our operating results have been and our future operating results could be adversely affected by one or more of the factors set forth above or other similar factors if our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market analysts or our investors our stock price may decline 

our operating results are substantially dependent on developing new products and achieving design wins as our customers requirements can change rapidly and product life cycles can be short 

our largest markets are characterized by the frequent introduction of new products in response to evolving product requirements driven by end user demand for more functionality improved performance lower costs and a variety of form factors our largest mp customers typically refresh some or all of their product portfolios by releasing new models each year in some cases product designs we pursue represent either opportunities to substantially increase our revenue by winning a new design or a risk of a substantial decrease in revenue by losing a product on which we are the incumbent 

our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely and costeffective manner and secure production orders from our customers the development of new products is a highly complex process and we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products at times our successful product development depends on a number of factors including the following 

• our ability to predict market requirements and define and design new products that address those requirements 

• our ability to design products that meet our customers’ cost size and performance requirements 

• our ability to introduce new products that are competitive and can be manufactured at lower costs or that command higher prices based on superior performance 

• acceptance of our new product designs 

• the availability of qualified product design engineers 

• our timely completion of product designs and ramp up of new products according to our customers’ needs with acceptable manufacturing yields and 

• market acceptance of our customers’ products and the duration of the life cycle of such products 

we may not be able to design and introduce new products in a timely or costefficient manner and our new products may fail to meet market or customer requirements most major product design opportunities that we pursue involve multiple competitors and we could lose a new product design opportunity to a competitor that offers a lower cost or equal or superior performance if we are unsuccessful in achieving design wins our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected even when a design win is achieved our success is not assured design wins may require significant expenditures by us and typically precede a higher volume revenue by six to nine months or more many customers seek a second source for all major components in their devices which can significantly reduce the revenue obtained from a design win in many cases the average selling prices of our products decline over the products’ lives and we must achieve yield improvements cost reductions and other productivity enhancements in order to maintain profitability the actual value of a design win to us will ultimately depend on the commercial success of our customers’ products 

we depend on several large customers for a substantial portion of our revenue and the loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a substantial portion of our mp revenue is currently from several large customers our future operating results will be affected by both the success of our largest customers and on our success in diversifying our products and customer base collectively our two largest end customers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 44 39 and 43 of our revenue for fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively if demand for their products increases our results are favorably impacted while if demand for their products decreases they may reduce their purchases of or stop purchasing our products and our operating results would suffer even if we achieve a design win our customers can delay or cancel the release of a new handset for any reason most of our customers can cease incorporating our products into their devices with little notice to us and with little or no penalty the loss of a large customer and failure to add new customers to replace lost revenue would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face risks of a loss of revenue if contracts with the united states government or defense and aerospace contractors are canceled or delayed or if defense spending is reduced 

we receive a portion of our revenue from the united states government and from prime contractors on united states governmentsponsored programs principally for defense and aerospace applications these programs are subject to delays or cancellation further spending on defense and aerospace programs can vary significantly depending on funding from the united states government we believe our government and defense and aerospace business has been negatively affected in the past by external factors such as sequestration and political pressure to reduce federal defense spending reductions in defense and aerospace funding or the loss of a significant defense and aerospace program or contract would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we may be subject to continued volatility and uncertainty in customer demand worldwide economies and financial markets resulting from the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has caused government authorities to implement numerous public health measures including quarantines business closures travel bans and lockdowns to contain the virus we have experienced and expect to continue to experience disruptions to our business as these measures have and may continue to have an effect on our customer demand and operations 

the covid19 pandemic including the recent covid19 lockdowns in china has been a contributing factor of the semiconductor industry supply constraints and may continue to cause volatility and uncertainty in customer demand worldwide economies and financial markets we have experienced and may continue to experience disruptions to our supply chain and increased costs in connection with our sources of materials components logistics services and other services caused in part by the pandemic to date any negative impact of covid19 on the overall demand for our products cash flows from operations need for capital expenditures and our liquidity position has been limited although we are addressing capacity constraints in our supply chain 

the spread of covid19 caused us to modify our business practices including employee travel employee work locations and cancellation of events and conferences and we may reinstitute these and take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed 

the degree to which covid19 and its variants impact our results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and spread of the pandemic its severity and the actions to contain the virus or immunize against or treat its impact 

we depend heavily on third parties 

we purchase numerous component parts substrates and siliconbased products from external suppliers we also utilize thirdparty suppliers for numerous services including die processing wafer bumping test and tape and reel the use of external suppliers involves a number of risks including the possibility of material disruptions in the 

supply of key components and the lack of control over delivery schedules capacity constraints manufacturing yields product quality and cost increases furthermore the covid19 pandemic and related supply chain disruptions and labor market constraints have created heightened risk that external suppliers may be unable to meet their obligations to us if we experience any significant difficulty in obtaining the materials or services used in the conduct of our business these supply challenges may limit our ability to fully satisfy customer demand 

as the semiconductor industry continued to experience supply constraints for certain items during fiscal 2022 we have entered into certain supply agreements to address short and longterm supply requirements however even with supply agreements we are still subject to risks that a supplier will be unable to meet its supply commitments achieve anticipated manufacturing yields produce wafers on a timely basis or provide additional wafer capacity beyond its current contractual commitments sufficient to meet our supply needs if so we may experience delays in product launches or supply shortages for certain products which could cause an unanticipated decline in our sales and damage our existing customer relationships and our ability to establish new customer relationships in addition if a supplier experiences financial difficulties or goes into bankruptcy it could be difficult or impossible or may require substantial time and expense for us to recover any or all of our fees and deposits made as part of any supply agreement 

although our key suppliers commit to us to be compliant with applicable iso 9001 andor ts16949 quality standards we have experienced quality and reliability issues with suppliers in the past quality or reliability issues in our supply chain could negatively affect our products our reputation and our results of operations 

we face risks related to sales through distributors 

we sell a significant portion of our products through thirdparty distributors we depend on these distributors to help us create end customer demand provide technical support and other valueadded services to customers fill customer orders and stock our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products may be limited because our end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor due to advantages in the incumbent distributors’ technical support and favorable business terms related to payments discounts and stocking of acceptable inventory levels using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks including competitive pressure concentration credit risk and compliance risks other third parties may use one of our distributors to sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to the distributors to focus them on the sale of our products our distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by our distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

we face risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing facilities 

we operate wafer fabrication facilities in north carolina oregon and texas we currently use several international and domestic assembly suppliers as well as internal assembly facilities in china costa rica germany and the us to assemble and test our products we currently have our own test and tape and reel facilities located in china costa rica and the us and we also utilize contract suppliers and partners in asia to test our products 

a number of factors related to our facilities will affect our business and financial results including the following 

• our ability to adjust production capacity in a timely fashion in response to changes in demand for our products 

• the significant fixed costs of operating the facilities 

• factory utilization rates 

• our ability to qualify our facilities for new products and new technologies in a timely manner 

• the availability of raw materials the impact of the volatility of commodity pricing and tariffs imposed on raw materials including substrates gold platinum and high purity source materials such as gallium aluminum arsenic indium silicon phosphorous and palladium 

• our manufacturing cycle times 

• our manufacturing yields 

• the political regulatory and economic risks associated with our international manufacturing operations 

• potential violations by our international employees or thirdparty agents of international or us laws relevant to foreign operations 

• our ability to hire train and manage qualified production personnel 

• our compliance with applicable environmental and other laws and regulations and 

• our ability to avoid prolonged periods of downtime in our facilities for any reason including but not limited to covid19 

business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs 

our worldwide operations and business could be and in some cases have been disrupted by natural disasters industrial accidents cybersecurity incidents telecommunications failures power or water shortages extreme weather conditions public health issues including the covid19 pandemic terrorist attacks political andor civil unrest acts of war or other military actions political or regulatory issues and other manmade disasters or catastrophic events global climate change could result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity such as drought wildfires storms and flooding we carry commercial property damage and business interruption insurance against various risks with limits we deem adequate for reimbursement for damage to our fixed assets and resulting disruption of our operations however the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses any disruptions from these events could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations and could also have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results to the extent that losses are uninsured or exceed insurance recoveries and to the extent that such disruptions adversely impact our relationships with our customers furthermore even if our own operations are unaffected or recover quickly if our customers or suppliers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a business disruption natural disaster or catastrophic event customers may reduce or cancel their orders and suppliers may delay manufacturing and delivery of our products which may adversely affect our results of operations 

if we experience poor manufacturing yields our operating results may suffer 

our products have unique designs and are fabricated using multiple process technologies that are highly complex in many cases our products are assembled in customized packages many of our products consist of multiple components in a single module and feature enhanced levels of integration and complexity our customers insist that our products be designed to meet their exact specifications for quality performance and reliability our manufacturing yield is a combination of yields across the entire supply chain including wafer fabrication assembly and test yields defects in a single component in an assembled module product can impact the yield for the entire module which means the adverse economic impacts of an individual defect can be multiplied many times over if we fail to discover the defect before the module is assembled due to the complexity of our products we periodically experience difficulties in achieving acceptable yields and other quality issues particularly with respect to new products furthermore as our customers test our products once assembled into their products we may be exposed to additional quality issues and costs 

the number of usable products that result from our production process can fluctuate as a result of many factors including 

• design errors 

• defects in photomasks which are used to print circuits on a wafer 

• minute impurities and variations in materials used 

• contamination of the manufacturing environment 

• equipment failure or variations in the manufacturing processes 

• losses from broken wafers or other human error and 

• defects in substrates and packaging 

we constantly seek to improve our manufacturing yields typically for a given level of sales when our yields improve our gross margins improve and when our yields decrease our unit costs are higher our margins are lower and our operating results are adversely affected costs of product defects and deviations from required specifications include the following 

• writing off inventory 

• scrapping products that cannot be reworked 

• accepting returns of products that have been shipped 

• providing product replacements at no charge 

• reimbursement of direct and indirect costs incurred by our customers in recalling or reworking their products due to defects in our products 

• travel and personnel costs to investigate potential product quality issues and to identify or confirm the failure mechanism or root cause of product defects and 

• defending against litigation 

these costs could be significant and could reduce our gross margins our reputation with customers also could be damaged as a result of product defects and quality issues and product demand could be reduced which could harm our business and financial results 

we are subject to inventory risks and costs because we purchase materials and build our products based on forecasts provided by customers before receiving purchase orders for the products in order to ensure availability of our products for some of our largest end customers we purchase materials and start manufacturing certain products in advance of receiving purchase orders based on forecasts provided by these customers however these forecasts do not represent binding purchase commitments and we do not recognize sales for these products until they are shipped to or consumed by the customer as a result we incur significant inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales for example amidst ongoing industrywide supply constraints we entered into a capacity reservation agreement with a foundry supplier during the second quarter ended october 2 2021 under the agreement we are required to purchase and the supplier is required to supply a certain number of wafers for calendar years 2022 through 2025 see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information because demand for our products may not materialize or may be lower than expected purchasing materials and manufacturing based on forecasts subjects us to heightened risks of higher inventory carrying costs increased obsolescence and higher operating costs these inventory risks are exacerbated when our customers purchase indirectly through contract manufacturers or hold component inventory levels greater than their consumption rate because this reduces our visibility regarding the customers’ accumulated levels of inventory if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory which would have a negative impact on our gross margin and other operating results 

we sell certain of our products based on reference designs of chipset suppliers and our inability to effectively manage or maintain our evolving relationships with these companies may have an adverse effect on our business 

chipset suppliers are typically large companies that provide system reference designs for oems and odms that include the chipset suppliers baseband and other complementary products a chipset supplier may own or control ip that gives it a strong market position for its baseband products for certain air interface standards which provides it with significant influence and control over sales of rf products for these standards chipset suppliers historically looked to us and our competitors to provide rf products to their customers as part of the overall system design and we competed with other rf companies to have our products included in the chipset suppliers system reference design this market dynamic has evolved as chipset suppliers have worked to develop more fully integrated solutions that include their own rf technologies and components 

chipset suppliers may be in a different business from ours or we may be their customer or direct competitor accordingly we must balance our interest in obtaining new business with competitive and other factors because chipset suppliers control the overall system reference design if they offer competitive rf technologies or their own rf solutions as a part of their reference design and exclude our products from the design we are at a distinct competitive disadvantage with oems and odms that are seeking a turnkey design solution even if our products offer superior performance this requires us to work more closely with oems and odms to secure the design of our products in their handsets and other devices 

our relationships with chipset suppliers are complex and evolving and the inability to effectively manage or maintain these relationships could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in a very competitive industry and must continue to innovate 

we compete with several companies primarily engaged in the business of designing manufacturing and selling rf solutions as well as suppliers of discrete integrated circuits and modules in addition to our direct competitors some of our largest end customers and leading platform partners also compete with us to some extent by designing and manufacturing their own products increased competition from any source could adversely affect our operating results through lower prices for our products reduced demand for our products losses of existing design slots with key customers and a corresponding reduction in our ability to recover development engineering and manufacturing costs 

many of our existing and potential competitors have entrenched market positions historical affiliations with oems considerable internal manufacturing capacity established ip rights and substantial technological capabilities the semiconductor industry has experienced increased industry consolidation over the last several years a trend we expect to continue many of our existing and potential competitors may have greater financial technical manufacturing or marketing resources than we do we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully with our competitors 

overcapacity could cause us to underutilize our manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

it is difficult to predict future demand for our products which makes it difficult to estimate future requirements for production capacity and avoid periods of overcapacity fluctuations in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products also can lead to overcapacity and contribute to cyclicality in the semiconductor market 

capacity expansion projects have long lead times and require capital commitments based on forecasted product trends and demand well in advance of production orders from customers in recent years we have made significant capital investments to expand our premium filter capacity to address forecasted future demand patterns in certain cases these capacity additions exceeded the nearterm demand requirements leading to overcapacity situations and underutilization of our manufacturing facilities 

as many of our manufacturing costs are fixed these costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues experienced during periods of underutilization underutilization of our manufacturing facilities can adversely affect 

our gross margin and other operating results if demand for our products experiences a prolonged decrease we may be required to close or idle facilities and write down our longlived assets or shorten the useful lives of underutilized assets and accelerate depreciation which would increase our expenses for example to address manufacturing overcapacity in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we commenced a phased closure of a saw filter manufacturing facility in florida and a transfer of production to our north carolina facility which was completed in fiscal 2020 in fiscal 2021 we temporarily idled a baw manufacturing facility in texas these actions resulted in impairment charges accelerated depreciation and other restructuring related charges and expenses 

unfavorable changes in interest rates pricing of certain precious metals utility rates and foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we may utilize hedging strategies from time to time to mitigate the impact due to underlying exposures such as interest rates precious metal prices utility rates or currency exchange rates however the impact from these underlying exposures cannot always be predicted or hedged and there can be no assurance that our hedging strategies will be effective in minimizing risk 

our acquisitions and other strategic investments could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives disrupt our ongoing business and adversely impact our results of operations 

as part of our business strategy we expect to continue to review potential acquisitions and strategic investments that could complement our current product offerings augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth or margin improvement opportunities in the event of future acquisitions of businesses products or technologies we could issue equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership incur substantial debt or other financial obligations or assume contingent liabilities such actions could harm our results of operations or the price of our common stock acquisitions and strategic investments also entail numerous other risks that could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition including 

• failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner if at all due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals ip disputes or other litigation difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us or other unforeseen factors 

• controls processes and procedures of an acquired business may not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations and we may fail to identify compliance issues or liabilities 

• unanticipated costs capital expenditures or working capital requirements 

• acquisitionrelated charges and amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles 

• the potential loss of key employees from a company we acquire or in which we invest 

• diversion of management’s attention from our business 

• disruption of our ongoing operations 

• dissynergies or other harm to existing business relationships with suppliers and customers 

• losses or impairment of investments from unsuccessful research and development by companies in which we invest 

• failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses operations products technologies and personnel and 

• unrealized expected synergies 

moreover our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs accordingly if we pursue a particular transaction we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could 

help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows particularly in the case of a large acquisition 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate key employees and our failure to do so could harm our business and our results of operations 

in order to compete effectively we must hire and retain qualified employees continue to develop leaders for key business units and functions expand our presence in international locations and adapt to cultural norms of foreign locations and train and motivate our employee base labor is further subject to external factors that are beyond our control including our industrys highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders cost inflation the covid19 pandemic and workforce participation rates our future operating results and success depend on keeping key technical personnel and management and expanding our sales and marketing rd and administrative support we do not have employment agreements with the vast majority of our employees we must also continue to attract qualified personnel the competition for qualified personnel is intense and the number of people with experience particularly in rf engineering software engineering integrated circuit and filter design and technical marketing and support is limited in addition existing or new immigration laws policies or regulations in the us may limit the pool of available talent travel bans difficulties obtaining visas and other restrictions on international travel could make it more difficult to effectively manage our international operations operate as a global company or service our international customer base changes in the interpretation and application of employmentrelated laws to our workforce practices may also result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain skilled personnel in the future which could harm our business and our results of operations 

we are subject to warranty claims product recalls and product liability 

from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expense we may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters and our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims 

product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and such insurance may be unavailable or inadequate to protect against all claims if one of our customers recalls a product containing one of our devices we may incur significant costs and expenses including replacement costs direct and indirect product recallrelated costs diversion of technical and other resources and reputational harm our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions relating to product quality issues the potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant and in some cases including in agreements with some of our largest end customers are potentially unlimited any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from sale of the relevant products costs payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in our effective tax rate may adversely impact our results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in china germany singapore the us and numerous other foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuations and impacted by a number of factors including the following 

• changes in our overall profitability and the amount of profit determined to be earned and taxed in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates 

• the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities including those described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

• changes in the valuation of either our gross deferred tax assets or gross deferred tax liabilities 

• adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns 

• changes in expenses not deductible for tax purposes 

• changes in available tax credits and 

• changes in tax laws domestic and foreign or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles 

any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

changes in the favorable tax status of our subsidiaries in costa rica and singapore would have an adverse impact on our operating results 

our subsidiaries in costa rica and singapore have been granted tax holidays that minimize our tax expense and that are expected to be effective through december 2027 and december 2031 respectively in their efforts to deal with budget deficits governments around the world are focusing on increasing tax revenues through increased audits and potentially increased tax rates for corporations as part of this effort governments continue to review their policies on granting tax holidays future changes in the status of either tax holiday could have a negative effect on our net income in future years 

the enactment of international or domestic tax legislation or changes in regulatory guidance may adversely impact our results of operations 

corporate tax reform baseerosion efforts and increased tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions in which we have business operations in 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which included a number of changes to us tax laws that impacted us including the onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the transitional repatriation tax and the global intangible lowtaxed income gilti provisions in addition other countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and action plan which aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder tax transfer pricing documentation rules nexusbased tax incentive practices allocating greater taxing rights to countries where customers are located and establishing a minimum tax on global income legislative changes interpretations and guidance and changes in prior tax rulings and decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes resulting from these initiatives could increase tax uncertainty increase our effective tax rate and result in taxes we previously paid being subject to change which may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to risks associated with environmental health and safety regulations including those related to climate change 

we are subject to a broad array of us and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations include those related to the use transportation storage handling emission discharge and recycling or disposal of hazardous materials used in our manufacturing assembly and testing processes our failure to comply with any of these existing or future laws or regulations could result in 

• regulatory penalties and fines 

• legal liabilities including financial responsibility for remedial measures if our properties are contaminated 

• expenses to secure required permits and governmental approvals 

• reputational damage 

• suspension or curtailment of our manufacturing assembly and test processes and 

• increased costs to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment or to modify our equipment facilities or manufacturing processes to bring them into compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

existing and future environmental laws and regulations could also impact our product designs and limit or restrict the materials or components that are included in our products in addition many of our largest end customers require us to comply with corporate social responsibility policies which often include employment health safety environmental and other requirements that exceed applicable legal requirements further an increasing number of investors are also expecting companies to disclose environmental social and governance esg policies practices and metrics on topics such as climate change carbon emissions water usage waste management and human capital compliance with these policies increases our operating expenses and noncompliance can adversely affect customer and investor relationships and harm our business and the price of our common stock 

regulations in the us currently require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products referred to as conflict minerals originated in the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries or were from recycled or scrap sources we may face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently make any required determination that the metals used in our products are conflict free 

new climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or procure substitute raw materials that may cost more or be more difficult to procure in addition new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in increased costs for us and our suppliers various jurisdictions are developing other climate changebased regulations that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results we expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future future compliance with these laws and regulations as well as meeting related customer and investor expectations may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

risks related to our international sales and operations 

we are subject to risks from international sales and operations 

we operate globally with sales offices and rd activities as well as manufacturing assembly and test facilities in multiple countries and some of our business activities are concentrated in asia as a result we are subject to regulatory geopolitical and other risks associated with doing business outside the us including 

• global and local economic social and political conditions and uncertainty 

• currency controls and currency exchange rate fluctuations 

• inflation as well as changes in existing and expected rates of inflation which vary across the jurisdictions in which we do business 

• formal or informal imposition of export import or doingbusiness regulations including trade sanctions tariffs and other related restrictions 

• labor market conditions and workers’ rights affecting our manufacturing operations or those of our customers or suppliers 

• disruptions in capital and securities and commodities trading markets 

• occurrences of geopolitical crises such as terrorist activity armed conflict civil or military unrest or political instability such as the conflict in ukraine which may disrupt manufacturing assembly logistics security and communications and result in reduced demand for our products 

• compliance with laws and regulations that differ among jurisdictions including those covering taxes intellectual property ownership and infringement imports and exports anticorruption and antibribery antitrust and competition data privacy and environment health and safety 

• markets for 5g infrastructure not developing in the manner or in the time periods we anticipate including as a result of unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide and 

• pandemics and similar major health concerns including covid19 and related mitigation actions such as the recent lockdowns in china which could adversely affect our business and our customer order patterns 

sales to customers located outside the us accounted for approximately 58 of our revenue in fiscal 2022 of which approximately 32 was attributable to sales to customers located in china we expect that revenue from international sales to china and other markets will continue to be a significant part of our total revenue any weakness in the chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for consumer products that contain our products which could materially and adversely affect our business the imposition by the us of tariffs on goods imported from china countermeasures imposed by china in response us export restrictions on sales of products to china and other government actions that restrict or otherwise adversely affect our ability to sell our products to chinese customers may have a material impact on our business including our ability to sell products and to manufacture or source components 

as a global company our results are affected by movements in currency exchange rates our exposure may increase or decrease over time as our foreign business levels fluctuate in the countries where we have operations and these changes could have a material impact on our financial results the functional currency for most of our international operations is the us dollar we have foreign operations in asia europe and central america and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the us our international revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars operating expenses and certain working capital items related to our foreignbased operations are in some instances denominated in the local foreign currencies and therefore are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies such as the costa rican colon euro pound sterling renminbi and singapore dollar if the us dollar weakens compared to these and other currencies our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when remeasured back into us dollars 

economic regulation in china could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we have a significant portion of our assembly and testing capacity in china for many years the chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid growth and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation in response to these factors the chinese government has from time to time adopted measures to regulate growth and to contain inflation including currency controls and measures designed to restrict credit control prices or set currency exchange rates such actions in the future as well as other changes in chinese laws and regulations including actions in furtherance of china’s stated policy of reducing its dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers could increase the cost of doing business in china foster the emergence of chinesebased competitors decrease the demand for our products in china and reduce the supply of critical materials for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

changes in government trade policies including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions have limited and could continue to limit our ability to sell or provide our products and other items to certain customers and suppliers which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the us or foreign governments have taken and may continue to take administrative legislative or regulatory action that could materially interfere with our ability to export reexport and transfer products and other items in certain countries particularly in china for example the imposition of tariffs has not had a direct material adverse impact on our business however the direct and indirect effects of tariffs and other restrictive trade actions are difficult to measure and are only one part of economic and trade policy 

furthermore we have experienced and may continue to experience restrictions on our ability to export reexport and transfer our products and other items to certain foreign customers and suppliers where exports reexports or transfers of products require export licenses or are prohibited by government action the us government has in the past imposed export restrictions that effectively banned american companies from exporting reexporting and transferring products to certain of our customers if such restrictions are imposed again in the future and even if subsequently lifted any financial or other penalties could have a continuing negative impact on our future revenue and results of operations in addition our customers or suppliers affected by future us government sanctions or threats of sanctions may respond by developing their own solutions to replace our products or by adopting our foreign competitors solutions 

we cannot predict what further actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or other trade measures between the us and china or other countries what products or entities may be subject to such actions or what actions may be taken by other countries in response the loss of foreign customers or suppliers or the imposition of restrictions on our ability to sell or transfer products to such customers or suppliers as a result of tariffs export restrictions or other us regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our sales business and results of operations 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt or to fund capital expenditures and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our debt obligations and financing requirements which may not be successful or on terms favorable to us 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund working capital planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts and any strategic alliances or acquisitions we may make in the future depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we cannot be sure that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay our debt if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may face liquidity issues and be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service and other obligations additionally our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition as a result we may not be allowed under these documents to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy our debt service obligations further we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt at or before maturity and we cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the agreements and instruments governing our debt impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility 

the credit agreement governing our revolving facility and term loan and the indentures governing our senior notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to 

• incur additional debt 

• pay dividends make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock 

• prepay redeem or repurchase certain debt 

• make loans and investments 

• sell transfer or otherwise dispose of assets 

• incur or permit to exist certain liens 

• enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates 

• enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends and 

• consolidate amalgamate merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets 

these covenants could have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete in addition our credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants operating results below current levels or other adverse factors including a significant increase in interest rates could result in our being unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in our revolving facility if we violate covenants under our credit agreement and are unable to obtain a 

waiver from our lenders our debt under our revolving facility would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders because of crossdefault provisions in the agreements and instruments governing our debt a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under and the acceleration of our other debt if our debt is accelerated we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if we are able to obtain new financing it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us if our debt is in default for any reason our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions 

risks related to intellectual property information technology and data privacy 

we rely on our intellectual property portfolio and may not be able to successfully protect against the use of our intellectual property by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that patents will be issued in all countries where our products can be sold further we cannot be certain that any claims allowed from pending applications will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection against our competitors our competitors may also be able to design around our patents 

the laws of some countries in which our products are developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws this increases the possibility of misappropriation or infringement of our technology and products although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology additionally our competitors may be able to independently develop noninfringing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours 

we may need to engage in legal actions to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights generally intellectual property litigation is both expensive and unpredictable our involvement in intellectual property litigation could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights 

our operating results may be adversely affected if third parties were to assert claims that our products infringed their patent copyright or other intellectual property rights such assertions could lead to expensive and unpredictable litigation diverting the attention of management and technical personnel an unsuccessful result in any such litigation could have adverse effects on our business which may include injunctions exclusion orders and royalty payments to third parties in addition if one of our customers or another supplier to one of our customers were found to be infringing on thirdparty intellectual property rights such a finding could adversely affect the demand for our products 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our proprietary information expose us to liability or disrupt our ability to operate critical business functions which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

we rely on trade secrets technical knowhow and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities to provide us with competitive advantages we protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants strategic partners and other third parties we also design our computer systems and networks and implement various procedures to restrict unauthorized access to dissemination of our proprietary information 

we face internal and external data security threats current departing or former employees or third parties could attempt to improperly use or access our computer systems and networks to copy obtain or misappropriate our proprietary information or otherwise interrupt our business like others we are also subject to significant system or network disruptions from numerous causes including computer viruses and other cyberattacks facility access issues new system implementations and energy blackouts 

security breaches computer malware phishing spoofing and other cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years while we defend against these threats on a daily basis we do not believe that such attacks to date have caused us any material damage because the techniques used by computer hackers and others to access or sabotage networks constantly evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate counter or ameliorate all of these techniques as a result our and our customers’ proprietary information may be misappropriated and the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted any loss of such information could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence in the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the incident and divert management and other resources we routinely implement improvements to our network security safeguards and we are devoting increasing resources to the security of our information technology systems we cannot however assure that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future cyberattack or network disruptions 

furthermore we rely on products and services provided by thirdparty suppliers to operate certain critical business systems including without limitation cloudbased infrastructure encryption and authentication technology employee email and other functions which exposes us to supplychain attacks or other business disruptions we cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems including our products and services or the thirdparty information technology systems that support our services our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited and these may not have adequate information security measures in place in addition if one of our thirdparty suppliers suffers a security breach our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems logs and other information related to the security breach 

if any of our systems are damaged fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions which could affect adversely our business and results of operations furthermore the costs related to cyberattacks or other security threats or computer systems disruptions typically would not be fully insured or indemnified by others occurrence of any of the events described above could also result in loss of competitive advantages derived from our rd efforts or our ip moreover these events may result in the early obsolescence of our products product development delays or diversion of the attention of management and key information technology and other resources or otherwise adversely affect our internal operations and reputation 

we may be subject to theft loss or misuse of personal data by or about our employees customers or other third parties which could increase our expenses damage our reputation or result in legal or regulatory proceedings 

in the ordinary course of our business we have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information regarding our employees and others that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations as well as our own policies and standards the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business or by our thirdparty service providers including business process software applications providers and other vendors that have access to sensitive data could result in damage to our reputation disruption of our business activities significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims 

global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment for example the european union has adopted the general data protection regulation gdpr which requires companies to comply with rules regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices complying with these changing laws has caused and could continue to cause us to incur substantial costs which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations further failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity finally even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in audits regulatory inquiries or proceedings against us by governmental entities or others 

risks related to owning our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying deterring preventing or rendering more difficult a change in control of qorvo that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests these provisions include 

• granting to the board of directors sole power to set the number of directors and fill any vacancy on the board of directors whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise 

• the ability of the board of directors to designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock without stockholder approval the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of the board of directors 

• the inability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders 

• establishment of advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to the board of directors at stockholder meetings and 

• the inability of stockholders to act by written consent 

in addition the general corporation law of the state of delaware contains provisions that regulate business combinations between corporations and interested stockholders who own 15 or more of the corporation’s voting stock except under certain circumstances these provisions could also discourage potential acquisition proposals and delay or prevent a change in control 

these provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit of any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context and may also make it more difficult for a third party to replace directors on our board of directors further the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 

the price of our common stock has recently been and may in the future be volatile 

the price of our common stock which is traded on the nasdaq global select market has been and may continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in addition the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include 

• general market and economic and political conditions including market conditions in the semiconductor industry 

• actual or expected variations in quarterly operating results 

• pandemics and similar major health concerns including the covid19 pandemic 

• differences between actual operating results and those expected by investors and analysts 

• changes in recommendations by securities analysts 

• operations and stock performance of competitors and major customers

• sales of our common stock including sales by our directors and officers or significant investors 

• repurchases of our common stock 

• recruitment or departure of key personnel and 

• loss of key customers 

we cannot assure that the price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future in addition the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to our performance

cash flows from operating activities 

operating activities in fiscal 2022 generated cash of 10492 million compared to 13019 million in fiscal 2021 this decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increased inventory as well as prepayments of certain fees and deposits associated with a longterm capacity reservation agreement the increased inventory related to the lower demand for 5g handsets from chinabased oems and the build of inventory in anticipation of certain customers product ramps these decreases to cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by increased profitability as a result of demand and revenue growth 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2022 was 5960 million compared to 2187 million in fiscal 2021 this increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisitions of nextinput and united sic in fiscal 2022 which resulted in net cash outflows of 3891 million as compared to the acquisition of 7hugs labs sas in fiscal 2021 which resulted in net cash outflows of 477 million see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our business acquisitions 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 was 8755 million compared to 4019 million in fiscal 2021 this increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to stock repurchases see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our stock repurchases 

our future capital requirements may differ materially from those currently anticipated and will depend on many factors including market acceptance of and demand for our products acquisition opportunities technological advances and our relationships with suppliers and customers based on current and projected levels of cash flows from operations coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents and our credit facility we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet both our shortterm and longterm cash requirements however if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products or if our revenue grows faster than we anticipate operating cash flows may be insufficient to meet our needs if existing resources and cash from operations are not sufficient to meet our future requirements or if we perceive conditions to be favorable we may seek additional debt or equity financing additional debt or equity financing could be dilutive to holders of our common stock further we cannot be sure that additional debt or equity financing if required will be available on favorable terms if at all

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to use judgment and estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could materially differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management our critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies however these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

inventory reserves the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons generally 12 to 24 months the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory reserves are the same as those used in our revenue forecasts and are also consistent with the estimates used in our manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory 

table of contents 

valuation process include a review of the customer base market conditions and customer acceptance of our products and technologies as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost 

historically inventory reserves have fluctuated as new technologies have been introduced and customers’ demand has shifted inventory reserves had an impact on margins of less than 2 in fiscal years 2022 and 2021 

property and equipment periodically we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property and equipment considering factors such as changes in machinery and equipment technology our ability to reuse equipment across generations of process technology and historical usage trends when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the revised useful lives of the assets 

we assess property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset group may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include an adverse change in our use of the assets or an expectation that the assets will be sold or otherwise disposed we assess the recoverability of the assets held and used by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts assets identified as held for sale are recorded at the lesser of their carrying value or their fair market value less costs to sell impairment if any is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets the process of evaluating property and equipment for impairment is highly subjective and requires significant judgment as we are required to make assumptions about items such as future demand for our products and industry trends 

business acquisitions we allocate the fair value of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded to goodwill goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination 

a number of assumptions estimates and judgments are used in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities particularly with respect to the intangible assets acquired the valuation of intangible assets requires the use of valuation techniques such as the income approach the income approach includes management’s estimation of future cash flows including expected revenue growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles and the discount rates applied to future cash flows 

judgment is also required in estimating the fair values of deferred tax assets and liabilities uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date as well as inventory property and equipment preexisting liabilities or legal claims deferred revenue and contingent consideration each as may be applicable 

while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill after the measurement period any purchase price adjustments are recognized in our consolidated statements of income 

goodwill impairment testing in accordance with asc 350  intangibles  goodwill and other  asc 350 goodwill is not amortized but rather is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on the first day of our fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recovered 

under asc 350 we have the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill 

table of contents 

we establish our reporting units based on our current organizational structure product and technology characteristics and segment managements view of the business as of january 2 2022 we identified three reporting units within the mp operating segment and two reporting units within the idp operating segment and we performed the optional qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its respective carrying value 

in performing qualitative assessments we consider i our overall historical and projected future operating results ii if there was a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period iii if there was a significant change in our market capitalization relative to our net book value and iv if there was a prolonged or more significant slowdown in the worldwide economy of the semiconductor industry as well as other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit 

in fiscal 2022 we completed our annual qualitative assessments and concluded that based on the relevant events and circumstances it was more likely than not that four of our five reporting units’ fair values exceeded their related carrying values however for one of our mp reporting units the acquired nextinput business it was determined that the market adoption of the acquired technology into mobile handsets is expected to be delayed compared to the previous assumptions therefore we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount and we performed a quantitative assessment to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit 

our quantitative assessment considered both the income and market approaches to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit the income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses estimates of the reporting units forecasted future financial performance including revenues operating expenses taxes and capital expenditures these estimates are developed as part of our longterm planning process based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share estimated costs based on historical data and various internal estimates projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate that properly accounts for the estimated market weightedaverage cost of capital as well as any risk unique to the cash flows the market approach is based on financial multiples ie multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization of comparable companies 

based on the quantitative assessment performed we determined that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of approximately 480 million the goodwill impairment charge is recorded in “other operating expense” in the statement of income for the fiscal year ended april 2 2022 

inherent in the fair value determination are significant judgments and estimates including assumptions about our future revenue profitability and cash flows our operational plans and our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations to the extent these assumptions are incorrect or there are further declines in our business outlook additional goodwill impairment charges may be recorded in future periods 

in fiscal 2021 we completed qualitative assessments and concluded that based on the relevant events and circumstances it was more likely than not that each of the reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its related carrying value and no further impairment testing was required 

identified intangible assets we amortize definitelived intangible assets including developed technology customer relationships technology licenses backlog and trade names over their estimated useful lives inprocess research and development iprd assets represent the fair value of incomplete rd projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of the acquisition initially these are classified as iprd and are not subject to amortization upon completion of development iprd assets are transferred to developed technology and are amortized over their useful lives the asset balances relating to abandoned projects are impaired and expensed to rd 

table of contents 

we evaluate definitelived intangible assets for impairment in accordance with asc 3601035  impairment or disposal of longlived assets  to determine whether facts and circumstances including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and forecasts indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable if such facts and circumstances exist we assess the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts impairments if any are based on the excess of the carrying amounts over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the impairment determination was made 

in connection with completing our fiscal 2022 annual goodwill impairment assessment we also evaluated our longlived intangible assets and determined that the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows related to these assets were in excess of their carrying values no definitelived intangible asset impairment charges were recorded for fiscal years 2022 or 2021 

revenue recognition we generate revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products either directly to a customer or to a distributor or at completion of a consignment process revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services a majority of our revenue is recognized at a point in time either on shipment or delivery of the product depending on individual customer terms and conditions revenue from sales to our distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors sellin revenue is recognized from our consignment programs at a point in time when the products are pulled from consignment inventory by the customer revenue recognized for products and services overtime is immaterial less than 3 of overall revenue we apply a fivestep approach as defined in asc 606  revenue from contracts with customers  in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized 1 identifying the contract with a customer 2 identifying the performance obligations in the contract 3 determining the transaction price 4 allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognizing revenue when the corresponding performance obligation is satisfied 

sales agreements are in place with certain customers and contain terms and conditions with respect to payment delivery warranty and supply but typically do not require minimum purchase commitments in the absence of a sales agreement our standard terms and conditions apply we consider a customers purchase order which is governed by a sales agreement or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer 

our pricing terms are negotiated independently on a standalone basis in determining the transaction price we evaluate whether the price is subject to a refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled variable consideration in the form of rebate programs is offered to certain customers including distributors and represents less than 7 of net revenue we determine variable consideration by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer our terms and conditions do not give our customers a right of return associated with the original sale of our products however we may authorize sales returns under certain circumstances which include courtesy returns and likekind exchanges we reduce revenue and record reserves for product returns and allowances rebate programs and scrap allowance based on historical experience or specific identification depending on the contractual terms of the arrangement 

our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from our customers payments are due upon completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing substantially all payments are collected within our standard terms which do not include any financing components to date there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable contract assets and contract liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets were immaterial as of april 2 2022 and april 3 2021 

we invoice customers upon shipment and recognize revenues in accordance with delivery terms as of april 2 2022 we had 4247 million in remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original 

table of contents 

duration greater than one year of which the majority is expected to be recognized as income over the next 12 months 

we include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and include the related shipping costs in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income taxes assessed by government authorities on revenueproducing transactions including tariffs valueadded and excise taxes are excluded from revenue in the consolidated statements of income 

we incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers sales commissions which are recorded in the selling general and administrative expense line item in the consolidated statements of income are expensed when incurred because such commissions are not owed until the performance obligation is satisfied which coincides with the end of the contract term therefore no remaining period exists over which to amortize the commissions 

income taxes in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense the resultant tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

as part of our financial process we assess on a tax jurisdictional basis the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not more likely than not a likelihood of less than 50 percent the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to ultimately be recoverable in this process certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the amount of income or loss in prior years the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies changes in taxable income market conditions us or international tax laws and other factors may change our judgment regarding whether we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets these changes if any may require material adjustments to the net deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding changes in the valuation allowance and net deferred tax assets 

as part of our financial process we also assess the likelihood that our tax reporting positions will ultimately be sustained to the extent it is determined it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of a tax reporting position will ultimately not be recognized and sustained a provision for unrecognized tax benefit is provided by either reducing the applicable deferred tax asset or accruing an income tax liability our judgment regarding the sustainability of our tax reporting positions may change in the future due to changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to the related deferred tax assets or accrued income tax liabilities and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions and the amount of unrecognized tax benefits 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

the primary objective of our financial risk management activities is to reduce the negative financial impact resulting from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices the underlying exposures we manage these underlying exposures through operational means as well as through the use of various financial instruments when deemed appropriate the method and extent to which we are able to reduce the financial impact related to the underlying exposures may vary over time similarly there can be no assurance that our financial risk management activities will be successful in mitigating the financial impact resulting from movements in the underlying exposures 

table of contents 

interest rate risk 

we may be exposed to interest rate risk via the terms of our credit facility if the credit facility were to be drawn through a term loan or our revolving facility it would bear interest at a variable rate see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information as of april 2 2022 we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as a global company our results are affected by movements in currency exchange rates our exposure may increase or decrease over time as our foreign business levels fluctuate in the countries where we have operations and these changes could have a material impact on our financial results the functional currency for most of our international operations is the us dollar we have foreign operations in asia central america and europe and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the us our international revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars operating expenses and certain working capital items related to our foreignbased operations are in some instances denominated in the local foreign currencies and therefore are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies such as the costa rican colon euro pound sterling renminbi and singapore dollar if the us dollar weakens compared to these and other currencies our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when remeasured back into us dollars we seek to manage our foreign currency exchange risk in part through operational means 

for fiscal 2022 we incurred a foreign currency loss of 15 million as compared to a loss of 38 million in fiscal 2021 which is recorded in other income expense net 

our financial instrument holdings including foreign receivables cash and payables at april 2 2022 were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes in this sensitivity analysis we assumed that the change in one currencys rate relative to the us dollar would not have an effect on other currencies rates relative to the us dollar all other factors were held constant if the us dollar declined in value 10 in relation to the remeasured foreign currency instruments our net income would have decreased by approximately 44 million in fiscal 2022 if the us dollar increased in value 10 in relation to the remeasured foreign currency instruments our net income would have increased by approximately 36 million in fiscal 2022 

equity price risk 

our marketable equity investments in publicly traded companies are subject to equity market price risk accordingly a fluctuation in the price of each equity security could have an adverse impact on the fair value of our investments as of april 2 2022 our marketable equity investments were immaterial see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

commodity price risk 

we routinely use precious metals in the manufacture of our products supplies for such commodities may from time to time become restricted or general market factors and conditions may affect the pricing of such commodities we also have an active reclamation process to capture any unused gold while we attempt to mitigate the risk of increases in commoditiesrelated costs there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully safeguard against potential shortterm and longterm commodity price fluctuations

we operate wafer fabrication facilities for the production of baw gan gaas saw and tcsaw wafers in north carolina oregon and texas we also use multiple siliconbased process technologies including soi sige and bulk cmos which are principally sourced from leading silicon foundries located throughout the world we have a global supply chain and ship millions of units per day 

we have our own flip chip wire bond and waferlevel packaging wlp technologies we primarily use internal assembly facilities in china costa rica germany and the us and we also use external suppliers for these and other packaging technologies 

manufacturing yields can vary significantly between products based on a number of factors including product complexity performance requirements and the maturity of our manufacturing processes to maximize wafer yields and quality we test products multiple times maintain continuous reliability monitoring and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the production flow 

our internal manufacturing facilities require a high level of fixed costs consisting primarily of occupancy costs maintenance repair equipment depreciation and labor costs related to manufacturing and process engineering 

semiconductor fabrication requires highly controlled and clean environments die on a wafer can be found to be nonfunctional or wafers can be rejected due to a number of reasons including minute impurities variances in the fabrication process or defects in the masks used to transfer circuit patterns onto the wafers 

our manufacturing facilities worldwide are certified to the iso 9001 quality standard and select locations are certified to additional automotive iatf 16949 aerospace as 9100 and environmental iso 14001 standards 

these stringent standards are audited and certified by thirdparty auditors in addition to our continuous internal selfaudits the iso 9001 standard is based on a number of quality management principles including a strong customer focus the motivation of top management the process approach and continual improvement iatf 16949 is the highest international quality standard for the global automotive industry and incorporates specific additional requirements for the automotive industry as 9100 is the standardized quality management system for the aerospace industry iso 14001 is an internationally agreed upon standard for an environmental management system we require that all of our key vendors and suppliers be compliant with select standards as applicable

seasonality 

our sales are the result of standard purchase orders or specific agreements with customers historically we have experienced seasonal fluctuations in the sale of mobile products with revenue typically strongest in our second and third fiscal quarters 

competition 

we operate in a competitive industry generally characterized by rapid advances in technology and new product introductions our customers’ product life cycles can be short and our competitiveness depends on our ability to improve our products and processes faster than our competitors anticipate changing customer requirements and successfully develop and launch new products while reducing our costs our competitiveness is also affected by the quality of our customer service and technical support and our ability to design customized products that address each customer’s particular requirements the selection process for our products is highly competitive and our customers provide no guarantees that our products will be included in the nextgeneration of products introduced 

mp competes primarily with broadcom inc murata manufacturing co ltd nxp semiconductors nv qualcomm technologies inc and skyworks solutions inc idp competes primarily with analog devices inc cree inc macom technology solutions inc nxp semiconductors nv silicon laboratories inc skyworks solutions inc stmicroelectronics nv and sumitomo electric device innovations 

many of our current and potential competitors have entrenched market positions and customer relationships established patents and other ip and substantial technological capabilities in some cases our competitors are also our customers or suppliers additionally many of our competitors may have significant financial technical manufacturing and marketing resources which may allow them to more quickly implement new technologies and develop new products 

intellectual property 

our ip including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets is important to our business and we actively seek opportunities to leverage our ip portfolio to promote our business interests we also actively seek to monitor and protect our global ip rights and to deter unauthorized use of our ip and other assets such efforts can be difficult because of the absence of consistent international standards and laws moreover we respect the ip rights of others and have implemented policies and procedures to mitigate the risk of infringing or misappropriating thirdparty ip 

patent applications are filed within the us and in other countries where we have a market presence on occasion some applications do not mature into patents for various reasons including rejections based on prior art in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect ip rights to the same extent as us laws we have approximately 2180 patents that expire from 2021 to 2041 we also continue to acquire patents through acquisitions or direct prosecution efforts and engage in licensing transactions to secure the right to use thirdparties’ patents in view of our rapid innovation and product development and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes there is no guarantee that our products will not be obsolete before the related patents expire or are granted however we believe the duration and scope of our most relevant patents are sufficient to support our business which as a whole is not significantly dependent on any particular patent or other ip right as we expand our products and offerings we also seek to expand our patent prosecution efforts to cover such products 

we periodically register federal trademarks service marks and trade names that distinguish our product brand names in the market we also monitor these marks for their proper and intended use additionally we rely on nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our interest in confidential and proprietary information that gives us a competitive advantage including business strategies unpatented inventions designs and process technology such information is closely monitored and made available only to those employees whose responsibilities require access to the information 

human capital 

we believe that our employees are our greatest assets and we must continue to attract develop retain and motivate our employees to remain competitive and execute our business strategy we strive to meet these objectives by offering competitive pay and benefits in a diverse inclusive and safe workplace and by providing opportunities for our employees to grow and develop their careers 

as of april 3 2021 we had approximately 8400 employees and approximately 700 temporary employees in 21 countries by region approximately 50 of our total employees are located in the united states 41 in asia 5 in europe and 4 in costa rica by major job function approximately 58 are engineering or technician roles 26 are manufacturing and 16 are professional or other administrative 

competitive pay and benefits 

we provide compensation and benefit packages that we believe are competitive within the applicable market we use a combination of compensation and other programs which vary by region and salary grade to attract motivate and retain our employees including semiannual performance bonuses stock awards an employee stock purchase plan retirement programs and health and wellness benefits and programs we benchmark our compensation and benefit packages annually to ensure we remain competitive with our peers and continue to attract and retain talent throughout our organization 

employee recruitment retention and development 

we are committed to recruiting hiring retaining promoting and engaging a diverse workforce to best serve our global customers we have established relationships with professional associations and industry groups to proactively attract talent and we partner with universities to recruit undergraduate and graduate students for our internship program and entry level positions we also invest in employee development programs to provide employees with the training and education they need to help achieve their career goals build relevant skills and lead their organizations 

we believe our competitive compensation and benefit programs along with career growth and development opportunities offered by us promote longer employee tenure and reduce turnover we monitor employee turnover rates as our success depends upon retaining and investing in our highly skilled manufacturing and technical staff our global attrition rate has consistently been below the technology industry average 

diversity equity and inclusion 

at qorvo we value the uniqueness that an inclusive and diverse global team brings to our company and we are focused on creating an environment that leverages the perspectives and contributions of each employee diversity equity and inclusion principles are included in our workplace training activities guidelines processes and programs employees are equipped with the knowledge and capabilities to welcome and embrace diversity and advocate for inclusion through employeedriven groups called qorvo employee networks our employees have an opportunity to connect through shared interests and goals and spur growth through professional and personal development these and other efforts help foster an inclusive workplace of talented employees and drive employee engagement 

safety health and wellness 

we are a member of the responsible business alliance rba an industry coalition dedicated to driving sustainable value for workers in global supply chains among other things as an rba member we have adopted the rba code of conduct which establishes standards to ensure that working conditions are safe that employees are treated with respect and dignity and that business operations are environmentally responsible and conducted ethically the rba code of conduct has been reflected in our other employee policies and procedures 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we reduced business travel and instituted comprehensive safety protocols for all qorvo facilities we successfully transitioned a significant number of our employees to work from home and we invested in additional wellness benefits including reimbursement programs to help employees improve home workspaces 

as always we prioritize safe working conditions we are committed to an injury free workplace and provide dedicated workplace training and leadership support to reduce or eliminate health and safety risks in fiscal 2021 we achieved a declining injury rate for the third consecutive year and recorded our lowest injury rate in qorvos history 

government regulations 

by virtue of operating our wafer fabrication facilities we are subject to a variety of extensive and changing domestic and international federal state and local governmental laws regulations and ordinances related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in the manufacturing process we pretreat and dispose of our wastewater from our manufacturing facilities to meet or exceed regulatory requirements our hazardous waste is only sent to licensed and permitted disposal facilities state agencies require us to report storage and emissions of environmentally hazardous materials and we have retained appropriate personnel to help ensure compliance with all applicable environmental regulations we believe that costs arising from existing environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

we are an iso 140012015 certified manufacturer with a comprehensive environmental management system ems in place to help ensure control of the environmental aspects of the manufacturing process our ems mandates compliance and establishes appropriate checks and balances to minimize the potential for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations 

we actively monitor the hazardous materials that are used in the manufacture assembly and test of our products particularly materials that are retained in the final product we have developed specific restrictions on the content of certain hazardous materials in our products as well as those of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers and subcontractors this helps to ensure that our products are compliant with the requirements of the markets into which the products will be sold and with our customers’ requirements for example our products are compliant with the european union rohs directive 201165eu on the restriction of use of hazardous substances which prohibits the sale in the european union market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing certain families of substances above a specified threshold 

historically the costs to comply with applicable environmental regulations have not been material and we currently do not expect the costs of complying with existing environmental regulations to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity capital resources or financial condition in fiscal 2022 

we are also subject to importexport controls tariffs and other traderelated regulations and restrictions in countries in which we have operations or otherwise do business these controls tariffs regulations and restrictions including those related to or affected by united stateschina relations as discussed below in item 1a risk factors may have a material impact on our business including our ability to sell products and to manufacture or source components 

government regulations are subject to change in the future and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether our compliance with such regulations will materially impact our business results of operations or financial condition

for a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business see below 

risks related to our business and industry 

our operating results fluctuate 

our revenue earnings margins and other operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future if demand for our products fluctuates as a result of economic conditions or for other reasons our revenue and profitability could be impacted our future operating results will depend on many factors including the following 

• business political and macroeconomic changes including trade restrictions and recession or slowing growth in the semiconductor industry and the overall global economy 

• changes in consumer confidence caused by many factors including changes in interest rates credit markets expectations for inflation unemployment levels and energy or other commodity prices 

• fluctuations in demand for our customers’ products 

• our ability to forecast our customers’ demand for our products accurately 

• the ability of thirdparty foundries and other thirdparty suppliers to manufacture assemble and test our products in a timely and costeffective manner 

• our customers’ and distributors’ ability to manage the inventory that they hold and to forecast accurately their demand for our products 

• our ability to achieve cost savings and improve yields and margins on our new and existing products 

• our ability to successfully integrate into our business and realize the expected benefits of our acquisitions and strategic investments and 

• our ability to utilize our capacity efficiently or to acquire additional capacity in response to customer demand 

our future operating results could be adversely affected by one or more of the factors set forth above or other similar factors if our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market analysts or our investors our stock price may decline 

our operating results are substantially dependent on developing new products and achieving design wins as our industry’s product life cycles are short and our customers’ requirements change rapidly 

our largest markets are characterized by the frequent introduction of new products in response to evolving product requirements driven by end user demand for more functionality improved performance lower costs and a variety of form factors our largest mp customers typically refresh some or all of their product portfolios by releasing new models each year in some cases product designs we pursue represent either opportunities to substantially increase our revenue by winning a new design or a risk of a substantial decrease in revenue by losing a product on which we are the incumbent 

our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely and costeffective manner and secure production orders from our customers the development of new products is a highly complex process and we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products at times our successful product development depends on a number of factors including the following 

• our ability to predict market requirements and define and design new products that address those requirements 

• our ability to design products that meet our customers’ cost size and performance requirements 

• our ability to introduce new products that are competitive and can be manufactured at lower costs or that command higher prices based on superior performance 

• acceptance of our new product designs 

• the availability of qualified product design engineers 

• our timely completion of product designs and ramp up of new products according to our customers’ needs with acceptable manufacturing yields and 

• market acceptance of our customers’ products and the duration of the life cycle of such products 

we may not be able to design and introduce new products in a timely or costefficient manner and our new products may fail to meet market or customer requirements most major product design opportunities that we pursue involve multiple competitors and we could lose a new product design opportunity to a competitor that offers a lower cost or equal or superior performance if we are unsuccessful in achieving design wins our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected even when a design win is achieved our success is not assured design wins may require significant expenditures by us and typically precede a higher volume revenue by six to nine months or more many customers seek a second source for all major components in their devices which can significantly reduce the revenue obtained from a design win in many cases the average selling prices of our products decline over the products’ lives and we must achieve yield improvements cost reductions and other productivity enhancements in order to maintain profitability the actual value of a design win to us will ultimately depend on the commercial success of our customers’ products 

we depend on several large customers for a substantial portion of our revenue 

a substantial portion of our mp revenue is currently from several large customers our future operating results will be affected by both the success of our largest customers and on our success in diversifying our products and customer base collectively our two largest end customers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 39 43 and 47 of our revenue for fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively if demand for their products increases our results are favorably impacted while if demand for their products decreases they may reduce their purchases of or stop purchasing our products and our operating results would suffer even if we achieve a design win our customers can delay or cancel the release of a new handset for any reason most of our customers can cease incorporating our products into their devices with little notice to us and with little or no penalty the loss of a large customer and failure to add new customers to replace lost revenue would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face risks of a loss of revenue if contracts with the united states government or defense and aerospace contractors are canceled or delayed or if defense spending is reduced 

we receive a portion of our revenue from the united states government and from prime contractors on united states governmentsponsored programs principally for defense and aerospace applications these programs are subject to delays or cancellation further spending on defense and aerospace programs can vary significantly depending on funding from the united states government we believe our government and defense and aerospace business has been negatively affected in the past by external factors such as sequestration and political pressure to reduce federal defense spending reductions in defense and aerospace funding or the loss of a significant defense and aerospace program or contract would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

the covid19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns these measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers there is continued uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures and restrictions on our access to our manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce or similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers and restrictions or disruptions of transportation such as reduced availability of air transport port closures and increased border controls or closures could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty the continued effects of the covid19 pandemic may cause an economic slowdown which would adversely affect our business demand for our products and the value of our common stock the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including employee travel employee work locations and cancellation of events and conferences and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed 

the degree to which covid19 impacts our results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and spread of the pandemic its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume 

we depend heavily on third parties 

we purchase numerous component parts substrates and siliconbased products from external suppliers we also utilize thirdparty suppliers for numerous services including die processing wafer bumping test and tape and reel the use of external suppliers involves a number of risks including the possibility of material disruptions in the supply of key components and the lack of control over delivery schedules capacity constraints manufacturing yields product quality and fabrication costs the semiconductor industry has experienced supply constraints for certain items including capacitors laminates and silicon if we experience any significant difficulty in obtaining the materials used in the conduct of our business these supply challenges may limit our ability to fully satisfy the demand for some of our products furthermore the covid19 pandemic has created heightened risk that external suppliers may be unable to perform their obligations to us or suffer financial distress due to the economic impact of the pandemic and the regulatory measures that have been enacted by governments to contain the virus 

although our key suppliers commit to us to be compliant with applicable iso 9001 andor ts16949 quality standards we have experienced quality and reliability issues with suppliers in the past quality or reliability issues in our supply chain could negatively affect our products our reputation and our results of operations 

we face risks related to sales through distributors 

we sell a significant portion of our products through thirdparty distributors we depend on these distributors to help us create end customer demand provide technical support and other valueadded services to customers fill customer orders and stock our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products may be limited because our end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor due to advantages in the incumbent distributors’ technical support and favorable business terms related to payments discounts and stocking of acceptable inventory levels using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks including competitive pressure concentration credit risk and compliance risks other third parties may use one of our distributors to sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to the distributors to focus them on the sale of our products our distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by our distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

we face risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing facilities 

we operate wafer fabrication facilities in north carolina oregon and texas we currently use several international and domestic assembly suppliers as well as internal assembly facilities in china costa rica germany and the us to assemble and test our products we currently have our own test and tape and reel facilities located in china costa rica and the us and we also utilize contract suppliers and partners in asia to test our products 

a number of factors related to our facilities will affect our business and financial results including the following 

• our ability to adjust production capacity in a timely fashion in response to changes in demand for our products 

• the significant fixed costs of operating the facilities 

• factory utilization rates 

• our ability to qualify our facilities for new products and new technologies in a timely manner 

• the availability of raw materials the impact of the volatility of commodity pricing and tariffs imposed on raw materials including substrates gold platinum and high purity source materials such as gallium aluminum arsenic indium silicon phosphorous and palladium 

• our manufacturing cycle times 

• our manufacturing yields 

• the political regulatory and economic risks associated with our international manufacturing operations 

• potential violations by our international employees or thirdparty agents of international or us laws relevant to foreign operations 

• our ability to hire train and manage qualified production personnel 

• our compliance with applicable environmental and other laws and regulations and 

• our ability to avoid prolonged periods of downtime in our facilities for any reason 

business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs 

our worldwide operations and business could be disrupted by natural disasters industrial accidents cybersecurity incidents telecommunications failures power or water shortages extreme weather conditions public health issues including the covid19 pandemic military actions acts of terrorism political or regulatory issues and other manmade disasters or catastrophic events global climate change could result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity such as drought wildfires storms and flooding we carry commercial property damage and business interruption insurance against various risks with limits we deem adequate for reimbursement for damage to our fixed assets and resulting disruption of our operations however the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses any disruptions from these events could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations and could also have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results to the extent that losses are uninsured or exceed insurance recoveries and to the extent that such disruptions adversely impact our relationships with our customers furthermore even if our own operations are unaffected or recover quickly if our customers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a business disruption natural disaster or catastrophic event they may reduce or cancel their orders which may adversely affect our results of operations 

if we experience poor manufacturing yields our operating results may suffer 

our products have unique designs and are fabricated using multiple semiconductor process technologies that are highly complex in many cases our products are assembled in customized packages many of our products consist of multiple components in a single module and feature enhanced levels of integration and complexity our customers insist that our products be designed to meet their exact specifications for quality performance and reliability our manufacturing yield is a combination of yields across the entire supply chain including wafer fabrication assembly and test yields defects in a single component in an assembled module product can impact the yield for the entire module which means the adverse economic impacts of an individual defect can be multiplied many times over if we fail to discover the defect before the module is assembled due to the complexity of our products we periodically experience difficulties in achieving acceptable yields and other quality issues particularly with respect to new products 

our customers test our products once they have been assembled into their products the number of usable products that result from our production process can fluctuate as a result of many factors including 

• design errors 

• defects in photomasks which are used to print circuits on a wafer 

• minute impurities and variations in materials used 

• contamination of the manufacturing environment 

• equipment failure or variations in the manufacturing processes 

• losses from broken wafers or other human error and 

• defects in substrates and packaging 

we constantly seek to improve our manufacturing yields typically for a given level of sales when our yields improve our gross margins improve and when our yields decrease our unit costs are higher our margins are lower and our operating results are adversely affected costs of product defects and deviations from required specifications include the following 

• writing off inventory 

• scrapping products that cannot be fixed 

• accepting returns of products that have been shipped 

• providing product replacements at no charge 

• reimbursement of direct and indirect costs incurred by our customers in recalling or reworking their products due to defects in our products 

• travel and personnel costs to investigate potential product quality issues and to identify or confirm the failure mechanism or root cause of product defects and 

• defending against litigation 

these costs could be significant and could reduce our gross margins our reputation with customers also could be damaged as a result of product defects and quality issues and product demand could be reduced which could harm our business and financial results 

we are subject to inventory risks and costs because we build our products based on forecasts provided by customers before receiving purchase orders for the products in order to ensure availability of our products for some of our largest end customers we start manufacturing certain products in advance of receiving purchase orders based on forecasts provided by these customers however these forecasts do not represent binding purchase commitments and we do not recognize sales for these products until they are shipped to or consumed by the customer as a result we incur significant inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales because demand for our products may not materialize or may be lower than expected manufacturing based on forecasts subjects us to heightened risks of higher inventory carrying costs increased obsolescence and higher operating costs these inventory risks are exacerbated when our customers purchase indirectly through contract manufacturers or hold component inventory levels greater than their consumption rate because this reduces our visibility regarding the customers’ accumulated levels of inventory if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory which would have a negative impact on our gross margin and other operating results 

we sell certain of our products based on reference designs of platform providers and our inability to effectively manage or maintain our evolving relationships with these companies may have an adverse effect on our business 

platform providers are typically large companies that provide system reference designs for oems and odms that include the platform provider’s baseband and other complementary products a platform provider may own or 

control ip that gives it a strong market position for its baseband products for certain air interface standards which provides it with significant influence and control over sales of rf products for these standards platform providers historically looked to us and our competitors to provide rf products to their customers as part of the overall system design and we competed with other rf companies to have our products included in the platform provider’s system reference design this market dynamic has evolved as platform providers have worked to develop more fully integrated solutions that include their own rf technologies and components 

platform providers may be in a different business from ours or we may be their customer or direct competitor accordingly we must balance our interest in obtaining new business with competitive and other factors because platform providers control the overall system reference design if they offer competitive rf technologies or their own rf solutions as a part of their reference design and exclude our products from the design we are at a distinct competitive disadvantage with oems and odms that are seeking a turnkey design solution even if our products offer superior performance this requires us to work more closely with oems and odms to secure the design of our products in their handsets and other devices 

our relationships with platform providers are complex and evolving and the inability to effectively manage or maintain these relationships could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in a very competitive industry and must continue to innovate 

we compete with several companies primarily engaged in the business of designing manufacturing and selling rf solutions as well as suppliers of discrete integrated circuits and modules in addition to our direct competitors some of our largest end customers and leading platform partners also compete with us to some extent by designing and manufacturing their own products increased competition from any source could adversely affect our operating results through lower prices for our products reduced demand for our products losses of existing design slots with key customers and a corresponding reduction in our ability to recover development engineering and manufacturing costs 

many of our existing and potential competitors have entrenched market positions historical affiliations with oems considerable internal manufacturing capacity established ip rights and substantial technological capabilities the semiconductor industry has experienced increased industry consolidation over the last several years a trend we expect to continue many of our existing and potential competitors may have greater financial technical manufacturing or marketing resources than we do we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully with our competitors 

industry overcapacity could cause us to underutilize our manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

it is difficult to predict future demand for our products which makes it difficult to estimate future requirements for production capacity and avoid periods of overcapacity fluctuations in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products also can lead to overcapacity and contribute to cyclicality in the semiconductor market 

capacity expansion projects have long lead times and require capital commitments based on forecasted product trends and demand well in advance of production orders from customers in recent years we have made significant capital investments to expand our premium filter capacity to address forecasted future demand patterns in certain cases these capacity additions exceeded the nearterm demand requirements leading to overcapacity situations and underutilization of our manufacturing facilities 

as many of our manufacturing costs are fixed these costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues experienced during periods of underutilization underutilization of our manufacturing facilities can adversely affect our gross margin and other operating results if demand for our products experiences a prolonged decrease we may be required to close or idle facilities and write down our longlived assets or shorten the useful lives of underutilized assets and accelerate depreciation which would increase our expenses for example to address manufacturing overcapacity in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we commenced a phased closure of a saw filter manufacturing facility in florida and a transfer of production to our north carolina facility which was completed in fiscal 2020 in 

texas we have temporarily idled a baw manufacturing facility these actions resulted in impairment charges accelerated depreciation and other restructuring related charges and expenses 

unfavorable changes in interest rates pricing of certain precious metals utility rates and foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we may utilize hedging strategies from time to time to mitigate the impact due to underlying exposures such as interest rates precious metal prices utility rates or currency exchange rates however the impact from these underlying exposures cannot always be predicted or hedged and there can be no assurance that our hedging strategies will be effective in minimizing risk 

our acquisitions and other strategic investments could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives disrupt our ongoing business and adversely impact our results of operations 

as part of our business strategy we expect to continue to review potential acquisitions and strategic investments that could complement our current product offerings augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth or margin improvement opportunities in the event of future acquisitions of businesses products or technologies we could issue equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership incur substantial debt or other financial obligations or assume contingent liabilities such actions could harm our results of operations or the price of our common stock acquisitions and strategic investments also entail numerous other risks that could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition including 

• failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner if at all due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals ip disputes or other litigation difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us or other unforeseen factors 

• controls processes and procedures of an acquired business may not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations and we may fail to identify compliance issues or liabilities 

• unanticipated costs capital expenditures or working capital requirements 

• acquisitionrelated charges and amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles 

• the potential loss of key employees from a company we acquire or in which we invest 

• diversion of management’s attention from our business 

• disruption of our ongoing operations 

• dissynergies or other harm to existing business relationships with suppliers and customers 

• losses or impairment of investments from unsuccessful research and development by companies in which we invest 

• failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses operations products technologies and personnel and 

• unrealized expected synergies 

moreover our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs accordingly if we pursue a particular transaction we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows particularly in the case of a large acquisition 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate key employees and our failure to do so could harm our business and our results of operations 

in order to compete effectively we must hire and retain qualified employees continue to develop leaders for key business units and functions expand our presence in international locations and adapt to cultural norms of foreign locations and train and motivate our employee base our future operating results and success depend on keeping key technical personnel and management and expanding our sales and marketing rd and administrative support we do not have employment agreements with the vast majority of our employees we must also continue to attract qualified personnel the competition for qualified personnel is intense and the number of people with experience particularly in rf engineering software engineering integrated circuit and filter design and technical marketing and support is limited in addition existing or new immigration laws policies or regulations in the us may limit the pool of available talent travel bans difficulties obtaining visas and other restrictions on international travel could make it more difficult to effectively manage our international operations operate as a global company or service our international customer base changes in the interpretation and application of employmentrelated laws to our workforce practices may also result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain skilled personnel in the future which could harm our business and our results of operations 

we are subject to warranty claims product recalls and product liability 

from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expense we may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters and our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims 

product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and such insurance may be unavailable or inadequate to protect against all claims if one of our customers recalls a product containing one of our devices we may incur significant costs and expenses including replacement costs direct and indirect product recallrelated costs diversion of technical and other resources and reputational harm our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions relating to product quality issues the potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant and in some cases including in agreements with some of our largest end customers are potentially unlimited any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from sale of the relevant products costs payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in our effective tax rate may adversely impact our results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in china germany singapore the us and numerous other foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuations and impacted by a number of factors including the following 

• changes in our overall profitability and the amount of profit determined to be earned and taxed in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates 

• the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities including those described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

• changes in the valuation of either our gross deferred tax assets or gross deferred tax liabilities 

• adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns 

• changes in expenses not deductible for tax purposes 

• changes in available tax credits and 

• changes in tax laws domestic and foreign or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles 

any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

changes in the favorable tax status of our subsidiaries in singapore and costa rica would have an adverse impact on our operating results 

our subsidiaries in singapore and costa rica have been granted tax holidays that minimize our tax expense and that are expected to be effective through december 2021 and december 2027 respectively in their efforts to deal with budget deficits governments around the world are focusing on increasing tax revenues through increased audits and potentially increased tax rates for corporations as part of this effort governments continue to review their policies on granting tax holidays future changes in the status of either tax holiday could have a negative effect on our net income in future years 

the enactment of international or domestic tax legislation or changes in regulatory guidance may adversely impact our results of operations 

corporate tax reform baseerosion efforts and increased tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions in which we have business operations in 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which included a number of changes to us tax laws that impacted us including the onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the “transitional repatriation tax” and the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” provisions in addition other countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and action plan which aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder tax transfer pricing documentations rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices legislative changes interpretations and guidance and changes in prior tax rulings and decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes resulting from these initiatives could increase our effective tax rate and result in taxes we previously paid being subject to change which may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to risks associated with environmental health and safety regulations and climate change 

we are subject to a broad array of us and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations include those related to the use transportation storage handling emission discharge and recycling or disposal of hazardous materials used in our manufacturing assembly and testing processes our failure to comply with any of these existing or future laws or regulations could result in 

• regulatory penalties and fines 

• legal liabilities including financial responsibility for remedial measures if our properties are contaminated 

• expenses to secure required permits and governmental approvals 

• reputational damage 

• suspension or curtailment of our manufacturing assembly and test processes and 

• increased costs to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment or to modify our equipment facilities or manufacturing processes to bring them into compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

existing and future environmental laws and regulations could also impact our product designs and limit or restrict the materials or components that are included in our products in addition many of our largest end customers require us to comply with corporate social responsibility policies which often include employment health safety environmental and other requirements that exceed applicable legal requirements compliance with these policies 

increases our operating expenses and noncompliance can adversely affect customer relationships and harm our business 

regulations in the us currently require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products referred to as conflict minerals originated in the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries or were from recycled or scrap sources we may face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently make any required determination that the metals used in our products are conflict free 

new climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or procure substitute raw materials that may cost more or be more difficult to procure in addition new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in increased costs for us and our suppliers various jurisdictions are developing other climate changebased regulations that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results we expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future future compliance with these laws and regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

risks related to our international sales and operations 

we are subject to risks from international sales and operations 

we operate globally with sales offices and rd activities as well as manufacturing assembly and test facilities in multiple countries and some of our business activities are concentrated in asia as a result we are subject to regulatory geopolitical and other risks associated with doing business outside the us including 

• global and local economic social and political conditions and uncertainty 

• currency controls and fluctuations 

• formal or informal imposition of export import or doingbusiness regulations including trade sanctions tariffs and other related restrictions 

• labor market conditions and workers’ rights affecting our manufacturing operations or those of our customers or suppliers 

• disruptions in capital and securities and commodities trading markets 

• occurrences of geopolitical crises such as terrorist activity armed conflict civil or military unrest or political instability which may disrupt manufacturing assembly logistics security and communications and result in reduced demand for our products 

• compliance with laws and regulations that differ among jurisdictions including those covering taxes intellectual property ownership and infringement imports and exports anticorruption and antibribery antitrust and competition data privacy and environment health and safety and 

• pandemics and similar major health concerns including covid19 which could adversely affect our business and our customer order patterns 

sales to customers located outside the us accounted for approximately 59 of our revenue in fiscal 2021 of which approximately 39 was attributable to sales to customers located in china we expect that revenue from international sales to china and other markets will continue to be a significant part of our total revenue any weakness in the chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for consumer products that contain our products which could materially and adversely affect our business the imposition by the us of tariffs on goods imported from china countermeasures imposed by china in response us export restrictions on sales of products to china and other government actions that restrict or otherwise adversely affect our ability to sell our products to chinese customers may have a material impact on our business including our ability to sell products and to manufacture or source components 

as a global company our results are affected by movements in currency exchange rates our exposure may increase or decrease over time as our foreign business levels fluctuate in the countries where we have operations and these changes could have a material impact on our financial results the functional currency for most of our international operations is the us dollar we have foreign operations in asia europe and central america and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the us our international revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars operating expenses and certain working capital items related to our foreignbased operations are in some instances denominated in the local foreign currencies and therefore are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies such as the costa rican colon euro pound sterling renminbi and singapore dollar if the us dollar weakens compared to these and other currencies our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when remeasured back into us dollars 

economic regulation in china could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we have a significant portion of our assembly and testing capacity in china for many years the chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid growth and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation in response to these factors the chinese government has from time to time adopted measures to regulate growth and to contain inflation including currency controls and measures designed to restrict credit control prices or set currency exchange rates such actions in the future as well as other changes in chinese laws and regulations including actions in furtherance of china’s stated policy of reducing its dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers could increase the cost of doing business in china foster the emergence of chinesebased competitors decrease the demand for our products in china or reduce the supply of critical materials for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

changes in government trade policies including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions have limited and could continue to limit our ability to sell or provide our products and other items to certain customers and suppliers which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the us or foreign governments have taken and may continue to take administrative legislative or regulatory action that could materially interfere with our ability to export reexport and transfer products and other items in certain countries particularly in china for example the imposition of tariffs has not had a direct material adverse impact on our business however the direct and indirect effects of tariffs and other restrictive trade actions are difficult to measure and are only one part of economic and trade policy 

furthermore we have experienced and may continue to experience restrictions on our ability to export reexport and transfer our products and other items to certain foreign customers and suppliers where exports reexports or transfers of products require export licenses or are prohibited by government action the us government has in the past imposed export restrictions that effectively banned american companies from exporting reexporting and transferring products to zte corporation one of our customers in may 2019 the bureau of industry and security of the us department of commerce “commerce” added huawei technologies co ltd and over 100 of its affiliates to the “entity list” maintained by commerce which caused us to temporarily suspend the export reexport and transfer of products to huawei in august 2020 commerce issued a final rule adding additional huawei nonus affiliates to the entity list confirming the expiration of a temporary general license applicable to huawei and amending the foreignproduced direct product rule in a manner that represents a significant expansion of its application to huawei huawei accounted for less than 5 of total revenue in fiscal 2021 and 10 of total revenue in fiscal 2020 while we were able to ship certain products to huawei in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 trade restrictions and our ability to secure any required licenses will continue to impact sales to huawei 

even if such restrictions are lifted any financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed on huawei could have a continuing negative impact on our future revenue and results of operations in addition huawei or other foreign customers or suppliers affected by future us government sanctions or threats of sanctions may respond by developing their own solutions to replace our products or by adopting our foreign competitors’ solutions 

we cannot predict what further actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or other trade measures between the us and china or other countries what products or entities may be subject to such actions or what actions may be taken by other countries in response the loss of foreign customers or suppliers or the imposition of restrictions on our ability to sell or transfer products to such customers or suppliers as a result of tariffs export 

restrictions or other us regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our sales business and results of operations 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt including our senior notes due 2029 and 2031 respectively or to fund capital expenditures and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our debt obligations and financing requirements which may not be successful or on terms favorable to us 

on september 29 2020 we entered into a fiveyear unsecured senior credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement with bank of america na as administrative agent swing line lender and lc issuer and a syndicate of lenders the “2020 credit agreement” the credit agreement amended and restated the previous credit agreement dated as of december 5 2017 the credit agreement includes a senior term loan the “2020 term loan” of up to 2000 million and a senior revolving line of credit the “revolving facility” of up to 3000 million collectively the “credit facility” 

in september 2019 december 2019 and june 2020 we issued 3500 million 2000 million and 3000 million respectively aggregate principal amount of 4375 senior notes due 2029 the “2029 notes” pursuant to an indenture dated as of september 30 2019 as supplemented the “2019 indenture” in september 2020 we issued 7000 million aggregate principal amount of 3375 senior notes due 2031 the “2031 notes” and together with the 2029 notes the “notes” pursuant to an indenture dated as of september 29 2020 the “2020 indenture” and together with the 2019 indenture the “indentures” 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations including the 2020 term loan and the notes and to fund working capital planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts and any strategic alliances or acquisitions we may make in the future depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we cannot be sure that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay our debt including the 2020 term loan and the notes if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may face liquidity issues and be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service and other obligations additionally the 2020 credit agreement and the indentures limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition as a result we may not be allowed under these documents to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy our debt service obligations further we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt at or before maturity and we cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the agreements and instruments governing our debt impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility 

the credit agreement governing the revolving facility and the term loan and the indentures governing the notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to 

• incur additional debt 

• pay dividends make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock 

• prepay redeem or repurchase certain debt 

• make loans and investments 

• sell transfer or otherwise dispose of assets 

• incur or permit to exist certain liens 

• enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates 

• enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends and 

• consolidate amalgamate merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets 

these covenants could have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete in addition the 2020 credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants operating results below current levels or other adverse factors including a significant increase in interest rates could result in our being unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in the revolving facility if we violate covenants under the 2020 credit agreement and are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders our debt under the revolving facility would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders because of crossdefault provisions in the agreements and instruments governing our debt a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under and the acceleration of our other debt if our debt is accelerated we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if we are able to obtain new financing it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us if our debt is in default for any reason our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions 

risks related to information technology and data privacy 

we rely on our intellectual property portfolio and may not be able to successfully protect against the use of our intellectual property by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that patents will be issued in all countries where our products can be sold further we cannot be certain that any claims allowed from pending applications will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection against our competitors our competitors may also be able to design around our patents 

the laws of some countries in which our products are developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws this increases the possibility of misappropriation or infringement of our technology and products although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology additionally our competitors may be able to independently develop noninfringing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours 

we may need to engage in legal actions to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights generally intellectual property litigation is both expensive and unpredictable our involvement in intellectual property litigation could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights 

our operating results may be adversely affected if third parties were to assert claims that our products infringed their patent copyright or other intellectual property rights such assertions could lead to expensive and unpredictable litigation diverting the attention of management and technical personnel an unsuccessful result in any such litigation could have adverse effects on our business which may include injunctions exclusion orders and royalty payments to third parties in addition if one of our customers or another supplier to one of our customers were found to be infringing on thirdparty intellectual property rights such a finding could adversely affect the demand for our products 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our proprietary information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

we rely on trade secrets technical knowhow and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities to provide us with competitive advantages we protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants strategic partners and other third 

parties we also design our computer systems and networks and implement various procedures to restrict unauthorized access to dissemination of our proprietary information 

we face internal and external data security threats current departing or former employees or third parties could attempt to improperly use or access our computer systems and networks to copy obtain or misappropriate our proprietary information or otherwise interrupt our business like others we are also subject to significant system or network disruptions from numerous causes including computer viruses and other cyberattacks facility access issues new system implementations and energy blackouts 

security breaches computer malware phishing spoofing and other cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years while we defend against these threats on a daily basis we do not believe that such attacks to date have caused us any material damage because the techniques used by computer hackers and others to access or sabotage networks constantly evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate counter or ameliorate all of these techniques as a result our and our customers’ proprietary information may be misappropriated and the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted any loss of such information could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence in the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the incident and divert management and other resources we routinely implement improvements to our network security safeguards and we are devoting increasing resources to the security of our information technology systems we cannot however assure that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future cyberattack or network disruptions 

the costs related to cyberattacks or other security threats or computer systems disruptions typically would not be fully insured or indemnified by others occurrence of any of the events described above could result in loss of competitive advantages derived from our rd efforts or our ip moreover these events may result in the early obsolescence of our products product development delays or diversion of the attention of management and key information technology and other resources or otherwise adversely affect our internal operations and reputation or degrade our financial results and stock price 

we may be subject to theft loss or misuse of personal data by or about our employees customers or other third parties which could increase our expenses damage our reputation or result in legal or regulatory proceedings 

in the ordinary course of our business we have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information regarding our employees and others that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business or by our thirdparty service providers including business process software applications providers and other vendors that have access to sensitive data could result in damage to our reputation disruption of our business activities significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims 

global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment for example the european union has adopted the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which requires companies to comply with rules regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices complying with these changing laws has caused and could continue to cause us to incur substantial costs which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations further failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity finally even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in audits regulatory inquiries or proceedings against us by governmental entities or others 

risks related to owning our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying deterring preventing or rendering more difficult a change in control of qorvo that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests these provisions include 

• granting to the board of directors sole power to set the number of directors and fill any vacancy on the board of directors whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise 

• the ability of the board of directors to designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock without stockholder approval the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of the board of directors 

• the inability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders 

• establishment of advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to the board of directors at stockholder meetings and 

• the inability of stockholders to act by written consent 

in addition the general corporation law of the state of delaware contains provisions that regulate “business combinations” between corporations and interested stockholders who own 15 or more of the corporation’s voting stock except under certain circumstances these provisions could also discourage potential acquisition proposals and delay or prevent a change in control 

these provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit of any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context and may also make it more difficult for a third party to replace directors on our board of directors further the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 

the price of our common stock has recently been and may in the future be volatile 

the price of our common stock which is traded on the nasdaq global select market has been and may continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in addition the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include 

• general market and economic and political conditions including market conditions in the semiconductor industry 

• actual or expected variations in quarterly operating results 

• pandemics and similar major health concerns including the covid19 pandemic 

• differences between actual operating results and those expected by investors and analysts 

• changes in recommendations by securities analysts 

• operations and stock performance of competitors and major customers 

• accounting charges including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill and restructuring 

• significant acquisitions strategic alliances capital commitments or new products announced by us or by our competitors 

• sales of our common stock including sales by our directors and officers or significant investors 

• repurchases of our common stock 

• recruitment or departure of key personnel and 

• loss of key customers 

we cannot assure that the price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future in addition the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to our performance

revenue 

revenue increased primarily due to higher demand for our 5g mobile solutions 5g base station products and wifi products partially offset by lower shipments of our mobile products to huawei 

we provided our products to our largest end customer apple through sales to multiple contract manufacturers which in the aggregate accounted for 30 and 33 of total revenue in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively huawei accounted for less than 5 of total revenue in fiscal 2021 and 10 of total revenue in fiscal 2020 these customers primarily purchase rf solutions for a variety of mobile devices see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

  

in may 2019 the bureau of industry and security of the us department of commerce commerce added huawei technologies co ltd and over 100 of its affiliates to the entity list maintained by commerce which caused us to temporarily suspend the export reexport and transfer of products to huawei in august 2020 commerce issued a final rule adding additional huawei nonus affiliates to the entity list confirming the expiration of a temporary general license applicable to huawei and amending the foreignproduced direct product rule in a manner that represents a significant expansion of its application to huawei while we were able to ship certain products to huawei in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 trade restrictions and our ability to secure any required licenses will continue to impact sales to huawei 

international shipments amounted to 23842 million in fiscal 2021 approximately 59 of revenue compared to 17708 million in fiscal 2020 approximately 55 of revenue shipments to asia totaled 21912 million in 

fiscal 2021 approximately 55 of revenue compared to 16164 million in fiscal 2020 approximately 50 of revenue 

gross margin 

gross margin increased primarily due to increased volume improved mix and higher factory utilization associated with the ramp of 5g wifi 6 and other products productivity and lower inventory charges also contributed to gross margin expansion partially offset by more moderate price effects 

operating expenses 

research and development 

rd spending increased primarily due to higher personnel costs and increased product development spend partially offset by lower travel expense 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher personnel and commission expenses partially offset by lower travel expense and lower intangible amortization expense

see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment operating income to the consolidated operating income for fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 

interest other expense income and income taxes 



interest expense 

we recognized 793 million of interest expense in fiscal 2021 primarily related to the 2026 notes the 2029 notes and the 2031 notes we recognized 660 million of interest expense in fiscal 2020 primarily related to the 2026 notes and the 2029 notes interest expense in the preceding table for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 is net of capitalized interest of 41 million and 56 million respectively 

other expense income net 

during fiscal 2021 we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 620 million see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our debt extinguishment activity during fiscal 2021 we recorded 215 million of income based on our share of the earnings from our equity method investments 

during fiscal 2020 we recorded a gain of 430 million related to the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in cavendish kinetics limited cavendish in connection with our purchase of the remaining issued and outstanding capital of the entity see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the cavendish acquisition during fiscal 2020 we recorded an impairment of 183 million on an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our investments 

income tax expense 

income tax expense for fiscal 2021 was 738 million this was primarily comprised of tax expense related to domestic and international operations generating pretax book income the impact of the tax acts gilti provisions taxes on certain foreign earnings which are not permanently reinvested and an increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits offset by a tax benefit related to domestic and international operations generating pretax book losses and domestic tax credits for fiscal 2021 this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 91 

income tax expense for fiscal 2020 was 608 million this was primarily comprised of tax expense related to international operations generating pretax book income the impact of the tax acts gilti provisions the reversal of the permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to certain unrepatriated foreign earnings and an increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits offset by a tax benefit related to international operations generating pretax book losses and domestic tax credits for fiscal 2020 this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 154 

a valuation allowance has been established against deferred tax assets in the taxing jurisdictions where based upon the positive and negative evidence available it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized realization is dependent upon generating future income in the taxing jurisdictions in which the operating loss carryovers credit carryovers depreciable tax basis and other deferred tax assets exist management reevaluates the ability to realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis as of the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 the valuation allowance against domestic and foreign deferred tax assets was 365 million and 353 million respectively 

see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 

stockbased compensation 

under financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc 718 compensation – stock compensation stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award using an option pricing model for stock options blackscholes and market price for restricted stock units and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period 

as of april 3 2021 total remaining unearned compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units was 1037 million which will be amortized over the weightedaverage remaining service period of approximately 12 years 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity as of april 3 2021 we had working capital of approximately 18022 million including 13979 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to working capital of 11515 million including 7149 million in cash and cash equivalents as of march 28 2020 

our 13979 million of total cash and cash equivalents as of april 3 2021 includes approximately 10703 million held by our foreign subsidiaries of which 9548 million is held by qorvo international pte ltd in singapore if the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are needed in the us we may be required to pay state income andor foreign local withholding taxes to repatriate these earnings 

at this time we are not able to estimate the longterm impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flow we believe we have sufficient liquidity available from operating cash flow cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility however as the situation continues to evolve we will assess our liquidity needs evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions 

credit agreement 

on september 29 2020 we and certain of our us subsidiaries the “guarantors” entered into a fiveyear unsecured senior credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement the “2020 credit agreement” with bank of america na acting as administrative agent and a syndicate of lenders the 2020 credit agreement amended and restated our previous credit agreement dated as of december 5 2017 the “2017 credit agreement” the 2020 credit agreement includes the 2020 term loan and a senior revolving line of credit the “revolving facility” of up to 3000 million collectively the “credit facility” 

during fiscal 2021 we made principal payments totaling 25 million on the term loan under the 2017 credit agreement the “2017 term loan” on the closing date of the 2020 credit agreement we repaid the remaining principal balance of 975 million on the 2017 term loan and concurrently drew 2000 million under the 2020 term loan 

during fiscal 2021 we made principal payments totaling 25 million on the 2020 term loan interest paid on the 2017 term loan and 2020 term loan during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was 21 million and 24 million respectively 

pursuant to the 2020 credit agreement we may request one or more additional tranches of term loans or increases to the revolving facility up to an aggregate of 5000 million and subject to securing additional funding commitments from the existing or new lenders the revolving facility includes a 250 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a 100 million sublimit for swing line loans the credit facility is available to finance working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes outstanding amounts are due in full on the maturity date of september 29 2025 subject to scheduled amortization of the 2020 term loan principal prior to the maturity date as set forth in the 2020 credit agreement during fiscal 2021 there were no borrowings under the revolving facility 

see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information about the credit agreement including applicable interest rates and financial covenants as of april 3 2021 we were in compliance with all the financial covenants under the credit agreement 

stock repurchases 

on october 31 2019 we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to 10 billion of our outstanding common stock which included approximately 1170 million authorized under the prior program which was terminated concurrent with this authorization under this program share repurchases were made in accordance with applicable securities laws on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the number and timing of shares repurchased depended on general market conditions regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other considerations the program did not require us to repurchase a minimum number of shares and did not have a fixed term 

we repurchased 36 million shares 64 million shares and 91 million shares of our common stock during fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively at an aggregate cost of 5151 million 5151 million and 6381 million respectively on may 5 2021 we announced that our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our new repurchase program 

cash flows from operating activities 

operating activities in fiscal 2021 generated cash of 13019 million compared to 9456 million in fiscal 2020 primarily due to increased profitability partially offset by changes in working capital driven by accounts receivable 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 was 2187 million compared to 11057 million in fiscal 2020 during fiscal 2021 we acquired 7hugs for 477 million and during fiscal 2020 we acquired activesemi international inc cavendish custom mmic and decawave limited which resulted in net cash outflows of 9460 million see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 was 4019 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 1656 million in fiscal 2020 this decrease in cash flows was due primarily to our debt financing activity see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

our future capital requirements may differ materially from those currently anticipated and will depend on many factors including market acceptance of and demand for our products acquisition opportunities technological advances and our relationships with suppliers and customers based on current and projected levels of cash flow from operations coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents and our credit facility we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet both our shortterm and longterm cash requirements however if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products or if our revenue grows faster than we anticipate operating cash 

flows may be insufficient to meet our needs if existing resources and cash from operations are not sufficient to meet our future requirements or if we perceive conditions to be favorable we may seek additional debt or equity financing additional equity or debt financing could be dilutive to holders of our common stock further we cannot be sure that additional equity or debt financing if required will be available on favorable terms if at all 

impact of inflation 

we do not believe that the effects of inflation had a significant impact on our revenue or operating income during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 however there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of april 3 2021 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments in thousands as of april 3 2021 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 



1 capital commitments represent obligations for the purchase of property and equipment a majority of which are not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet because we had not received the related goods or services as of april 3 2021 

2 purchase obligations represent payments due related to the purchase of materials and manufacturing services a majority of which are not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet because we had not received the related goods or services as of april 3 2021 

3 longterm debt obligations represent future cash payments of principal and interest over the life of the 2029 notes the 2031 notes and the 2020 term loan including anticipated interest payments not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of april 3 2021 debt obligations are classified based on their stated maturity date and any future redemptions would impact our cash payments see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

other contractual obligations 

as of april 3 2021 in addition to the amounts shown in the contractual obligations table above we have 1403 million of unrecognized income tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties of which 212 million has been recorded as a liability we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled we also have an obligation related to the transitional repatriation tax we have elected to pay the remaining obligation of 54 million which has been recorded as a liability over four years see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

as discussed in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we have two pension plans in germany with a combined benefit obligation of approximately 140 million as of april 3 2021 pension benefit payments are not included in the schedule above due to the uncertainty regarding the amount and timing of any future cash outflows pension benefit payments were approximately 03 million in fiscal 2021 and are expected to be approximately 03 million in fiscal 2022 

we also offer a nonqualified deferred compensation plan to eligible participants to defer and invest a specified percentage of their cash compensation we record an obligation under the plan for the distributions to be made to participants upon certain triggering events although participants are required to make distribution elections at the time of enrollment the amount and timing of any future cash outflows is uncertain until such triggering events occur the total deferred compensation obligation as of april 3 2021 was 328 million of which 12 million is 

estimated to be paid out in fiscal 2022 see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

supplemental parent and guarantor financial information 

in accordance with the indentures our obligations under the 2029 notes and the 2031 notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several unsecured basis by the guarantors which are listed on exhibit 22 to this annual report on form 10k each guarantor is 100 owned directly or indirectly by qorvo inc parent a guarantor can be released in certain customary circumstances our other us subsidiaries and our nonus subsidiaries do not guarantee the 2029 notes and the 2031 notes such subsidiaries are referred to as the nonguarantors 

the following presents summarized financial information for the parent and the guarantors on a combined basis as of and for the periods indicated after eliminating i intercompany transactions and balances among the parent and guarantors and ii equity earnings from and investments in any nonguarantor the summarized financial information may not necessarily be indicative of the financial position and results of operations had the combined parent and guarantors operated independently from the nonguarantors 





critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to use judgment and estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management our critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies however these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

inventory reserves the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products 

within specific time horizons generally 12 to 24 months the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory reserves are the same as those used in our revenue forecasts and are also consistent with the estimates used in our manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base market conditions and customer acceptance of our products and technologies as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost 

historically inventory reserves have fluctuated as new technologies have been introduced and customers’ demand has shifted inventory reserves had an impact on margins of less than 2 in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 

property and equipment periodically we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property and equipment considering factors such as changes in machinery and equipment technology our ability to reuse equipment across generations of process technology and historical usage trends when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the revised useful lives of the assets 

we assess property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset group may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include an adverse change in our use of the assets or an expectation that the assets will be sold or otherwise disposed we assess the recoverability of the assets held and used by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts assets identified as held for sale are recorded at the lesser of their carrying value or their fair market value less costs to sell impairment if any is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets the process of evaluating property and equipment for impairment is highly subjective and requires significant judgment as we are required to make assumptions about items such as future demand for our products and industry trends 

business acquisitions we allocate the fair value of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded to goodwill goodwill is assigned to our reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination 

a number of assumptions estimates and judgments are used in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities particularly with respect to the intangible assets acquired the valuation of intangible assets requires our use of valuation techniques such as the income approach the income approach includes management’s estimation of future cash flows including expected revenue growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles and the discount rates applied to future cash flows 

judgment is also required in estimating the fair values of deferred tax assets and liabilities uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date as well as inventory property and equipment preexisting liabilities or legal claims deferred revenue and contingent consideration each as may be applicable 

while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill after the measurement period any purchase price adjustments are recognized in our consolidated statements of income 

goodwill we perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level on the first day of the fourth quarter in each fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist in accordance with asc 350 we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill 

in performing a qualitative assessment we consider i our overall historical and projected future operating results ii if there was a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period iii if there was a significant change in our market capitalization relative to our net book value and iv if there was a prolonged or more significant slowdown in the worldwide economy of the semiconductor industry as well as other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit if we assess these qualitative factors and conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we decide not to perform a qualitative assessment then a quantitative impairment test is performed 

in fiscal years 2021 and 2019 we completed qualitative assessments and concluded that based on the relevant facts and circumstances it was more likely than not that each reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its related carrying value and no further impairment testing was required 

in fiscal 2020 we performed a quantitative impairment test our quantitative impairment test considered both the income approach and the market approach to estimate each reporting unit’s fair value the resulting fair value based on the income and market approaches was then compared to the carrying value to determine if impairment is necessary as a result of the quantitative analysis performed it was determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 

identified intangible assets we amortize finitelived intangible assets including developed technology customer relationships technology licenses backlog and trade names over their estimated useful life inprocess research and development iprd assets represent the fair value of incomplete rd projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of the acquisition initially these are classified as iprd and are not subject to amortization upon completion of development iprd assets are transferred to developed technology and are amortized over their useful lives the asset balances relating to abandoned projects are impaired and expensed to rd 

we perform a quarterly review of significant intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and forecasts indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable if such facts and circumstances exist we assess the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts impairments if any are based on the excess of the carrying amounts over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the impairment determination was made 

revenue recognition we generate revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products either directly to a customer or to a distributor or at completion of a consignment process revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services a majority of our revenue is recognized at a point in time either on shipment or delivery of the product depending on individual customer terms and conditions revenue from sales to our distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors sellin revenue is recognized from our consignment programs at a point in time when the products are pulled from consignment inventory by the customer revenue recognized for products and services overtime is immaterial less than 2 of overall revenue we apply a fivestep approach as defined in asc 606  revenue from contracts with customers in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized 1 identifying the contract with a customer 2 identifying the performance obligations in the contract 3 determining the transaction price 4 allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognizing revenue when the corresponding performance obligation is satisfied 

sales agreements are in place with certain customers and contain terms and conditions with respect to payment delivery warranty and supply but typically do not require minimum purchase commitments in the absence of a sales agreement our standard terms and conditions apply we consider a customers purchase order which is governed by a sales agreement or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer 

our pricing terms are negotiated independently on a standalone basis in determining the transaction price we evaluate whether the price is subject to a refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled variable consideration in the form of rebate programs is offered to certain customers including distributors and represents less than 7 of net revenue we determine variable consideration by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer our terms and conditions do not give our customers a right of return associated with the original sale of our products however we may authorize sales returns under certain circumstances which include courtesy returns and likekind exchanges we reduce revenue and record reserves for product returns and allowances rebate programs and scrap allowance based on historical experience or specific identification depending on the contractual terms of the arrangement 

our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from our customers payments are due upon completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing substantially all payments are collected within our standard terms which do not include any financing components to date there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable contract assets and contract liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets were immaterial as of april 3 2021 and march 28 2020 

we invoice customers upon shipment and recognize revenues in accordance with delivery terms as of april 3 2021 we had 875 million in remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year of which the majority is expected to be recognized as income over the next 12 months 

we include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and include the related shipping costs in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income taxes assessed by government authorities on revenueproducing transactions including tariffs valueadded and excise taxes are excluded from revenue in the consolidated statements of income 

we incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers sales commissions which are recorded in the selling general and administrative expense line item in the consolidated statements of income are expensed when incurred because such commissions are not owed until the performance obligation is satisfied which coincides with the end of the contract term and therefore no remaining period exists over which to amortize the commissions 

income taxes in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense the resultant tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

as part of our financial process we assess on a tax jurisdictional basis the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not more likely than not a likelihood of less than 50 percent the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to ultimately be recoverable in this process certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the amount of income or loss in prior years the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies changes in taxable income market conditions us or international tax laws and other factors may change our judgment regarding whether we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets these changes if any may require material adjustments to the net deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding changes in the valuation allowance and net deferred tax assets 

as part of our financial process we also assess the likelihood that our tax reporting positions will ultimately be sustained to the extent it is determined it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of a tax reporting position will ultimately not be recognized and 

sustained a provision for unrecognized tax benefit is provided by either reducing the applicable deferred tax asset or accruing an income tax liability our judgment regarding the sustainability of our tax reporting positions may change in the future due to changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to the related deferred tax assets or accrued income tax liabilities and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions and the amount of unrecognized tax benefits

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

the primary objective of our financial risk management activities is to reduce the negative financial impact resulting from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices the “underlying exposures” we manage these underlying exposures through operational means as well as through the use of various financial instruments when deemed appropriate the method and extent to which we are able to reduce the financial impact related to the underlying exposures may vary over time similarly there can be no assurance that our financial risk management activities will be successful in mitigating the financial impact resulting from movements in the underlying exposures 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk via the terms of our credit facility which is comprised of the 2020 term loan and revolving facility with variable interest rates see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information the outstanding balance related to the credit facility as of april 3 2021 was 1975 million a potential change in the associated interest rates would be immaterial to the results of our operations 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as a global company our results are affected by movements in currency exchange rates our exposure may increase or decrease over time as our foreign business levels fluctuate in the countries where we have operations and these changes could have a material impact on our financial results the functional currency for most of our international operations is the us dollar we have foreign operations in asia central america and europe and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the us our international revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars operating expenses and certain working capital items related to our foreignbased operations are in some instances denominated in the local foreign currencies and therefore are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies such as the costa rican colon euro pound sterling renminbi and singapore dollar if the us dollar weakens compared to these and other currencies our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when remeasured back into us dollars we seek to manage our foreign currency exchange risk in part through operational means 

for fiscal 2021 we incurred a foreign currency loss of 38 million as compared to a loss of 22 million in fiscal 2020 which is recorded in “other expense income net” 

our financial instrument holdings including foreign receivables cash and payables at april 3 2021 were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes in this sensitivity analysis we assumed that the change in one currencys rate relative to the us dollar would not have an effect on other currencies rates relative to the us dollar all other factors were held constant if the us dollar declined in value 10 in relation to the remeasured foreign currency instruments our net income would have increased by approximately 57 million in fiscal 2021 if the us dollar increased in value 10 in relation to the remeasured foreign currency instruments our net income would have decreased by approximately 47 million in fiscal 2021 

equity price risk 

our marketable equity investments in publicly traded companies are subject to equity market price risk accordingly a fluctuation in the price of each equity security could have an adverse impact on the fair value of our investments as of april 3 2021 our marketable equity investments were immaterial see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

commodity price risk

research and development 

we invest in research and development rd to develop advanced technologies and products necessary to serve our markets our rd activities focus primarily on large competitive design win opportunities for major programs at key customers which typically requires us to improve the functional density performance size and cost of our products we also have rd resources associated with the development of new products for broader market applications our rd efforts require us to focus on both continuous improvement in our processes for design and manufacture as well as new innovation in fundamental areas like materials software and firmware semiconductor process technologies simulation and modeling systems architecture circuit design device packaging module integration and test 

we have developed several generations of gaas gan baw and surface acoustic wave saw process technologies that we manufacture internally we invest in these technologies to improve device performance reduce die size and reduce manufacturing costs we also help develop and qualify technologies in cooperation with key suppliers including soi for switches and tuners silicon germanium sige for amplifiers and cmos for power management devices and soc solutions we combine these technologies with our proprietary design methods intellectual property ip and other expertise to improve performance increase integration and reduce the size and cost of our products 

we develop and qualify advanced packaging technologies to reduce component size improve performance and reduce package costs we are also investing in large scale module assembly and test capabilities to bring these technologies to market in very high volumes 

raw materials 

we purchase numerous raw materials passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing processes the industry has experienced isolated shortages for various components in the past 12 months including capacitors these shortages are being addressed by suppliers adding additional capacity as we build in flexibility to our supply chain by adding suppliers and by designing in alternate capacitors to use in our products 

for our gaas and gan manufacturing operations we use several raw materials including gaas and gan on silicon carbide wafers for our acoustic filter manufacturing operations we use several raw materials including wafers made from silicon lithium niobate or lithium tantalate 

for our siliconbased products we use thirdparty foundries high demand for silicon wafers and wafer starting materials has led to supply constraints from timetotime and we have attempted to address this by qualifying multiple silicon foundries and by obtaining supply commitments in some cases in exchange for purchase or capital commitments by us 

our manufacturing strategy includes a balance of internal and external sites primarily for assembly and test operations which helps reduce costs provides flexibility of supply and minimizes the risk of supply disruption we routinely qualify multiple sources of supply and manufacturing sites to reduce the risk of supply interruptions or price increases and closely monitor suppliers’ key performance indicators our suppliers and our manufacturing sites are geographically diversified with our largest volume sources distributed throughout southern and eastern asia we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing needs 

qorvo is currently experiencing isolated supplychain issues caused by the recent novel coronavirus covid19 outbreak while this is a dynamic situation impacting the entire industry we have a broadly diversified supply base and our operations are not currently materially impacted 

manufacturing 

we are a manufacturer of baw gan gaas saw tcsaw and silicon products the majority of our products are multichip modules utilizing multiple semiconductor and acoustic material processing technologies these products have varying degrees of complexity and contain semiconductors and other components that are manufactured internally or outsourced 

we operate wafer fabrication facilities for the production of baw gan gaas saw and tcsaw wafers in greensboro north carolina hillsboro oregon and richardson texas we also use multiple siliconbased process technologies including soi sige and cmos which are principally sourced from leading silicon foundries located throughout the world we have a global supply chain and ship millions of units per day 

we have our own flip chip wire bond and waferlevel packaging wlp technologies additionally we use external suppliers for these and other packaging technologies 

at the end of the semiconductor manufacturing process we regularly conduct wafer level tests to verify individual circuit performance these tests could include electrical validation rf testing through designed frequency bands as well as visual defect inspection the wafers are then separated into individual components called die for module products the next step is assembly during which the die and other components are placed on highdensity interconnect substrates to provide connectivity between the die and the components this populated substrate is formed into a module next the products are tested for rf performance and prepared for shipment through a tape and reel process we primarily use internal assembly facilities in china costa rica germany and the us and we also utilize external suppliers we also manufacture large volumes of wlp die and discrete filters that our customers directly assemble into their products 

manufacturing yields can vary significantly between products based on a number of factors including product complexity performance requirements and the maturity of our manufacturing processes to maximize wafer yields and quality we test products multiple times maintain continuous reliability monitoring and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the production flow 

our internal manufacturing facilities require a high level of fixed costs consisting primarily of occupancy costs maintenance repair equipment depreciation and fixed labor costs related to manufacturing and process engineering 

integrated circuits and filter products are highly complex and sensitive to contaminants and semiconductor fabrication requires highly controlled clean environments wafers can be rejected or die on a wafer can be found to be nonfunctional as a result of minute impurities variances in the fabrication process or defects in the masks used to transfer circuit patterns onto the wafers 

our manufacturing facilities worldwide are certified to the iso 9001 quality standard and select locations are certified to additional automotive iatf 16949 aerospace as 9100 and environmental iso 14001 standards these stringent standards are audited and certified by thirdparty auditors in addition to our continuous internal selfaudits the iso 9001 standard is based on a number of quality management principles including a strong customer focus the motivation of top management the process approach and continual improvement iatf 16949 is the highest international quality standard for the global automotive industry and incorporates specific additional requirements for the automotive industry as 9100 is the standardized quality management system for the aerospace industry iso 14001 is an internationally agreed upon standard for an environmental management system we require that all of our key vendors and suppliers be compliant with select standards as applicable 

customers 

we design develop manufacture and market products for leading us and international oems and original design manufacturers odms we also collaborate with leading reference design partners 

we provide our products to our largest end customer apple inc apple through sales to multiple contract manufacturers which in the aggregate accounted for 33  32  and 36 of total revenue in fiscal years 2020  2019 and 2018  respectively huawei technologies co ltd and affiliates huawei accounted for 10  15 and 8 of our total revenue in fiscal years 2020  2019 and 2018  respectively these customers primarily purchase rf solutions for a variety of mobile devices 

some of our sales to overseas customers are subject to export licenses or other restrictions imposed by the us department of commerce see risk factors in part i item 1a set forth in this report 

sales and marketing 

we sell our products worldwide directly to customers as well as through a network of us and foreign sales representative firms and distributors we select our domestic and foreign sales representatives based on technical skills and sales experience the presence of complementary product lines and the customer base served we provide ongoing training to our internal and external sales representatives and distributors to keep them educated about our products we maintain an internal sales and marketing organization that is responsible for key account management application engineering support for customers sales and advertising literature and technical presentations for industry conferences our sales and customer support centers are located near our customers throughout the world 

our website contains extensive product information and includes an online store where customers can learn about our products download product catalogs order product samples and request evaluation boards our global team of application engineers interacts with customers during all stages of design and production maintains regular contact with customer engineers provides product application notes and engineering data and assists in the resolution of technical problems we maintain close relationships with our customers and platform providers and provide them strong technical support to help anticipate future product needs and enhance their customer experience 

backlog and seasonality 

our sales are the result of standard purchase orders or specific agreements with customers because industry practice allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment and with little or no penalty we believe that backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels 

historically we have experienced seasonal fluctuations in the sale of mobile products with revenue typically strongest in our second and third fiscal quarters 

competition 

we operate in a competitive industry characterized by rapid advances in technology and new product introductions our customers’ product life cycles are often short and our competitiveness depends on our ability to improve our products and processes faster than our competitors anticipate changing customer requirements and successfully develop and launch new products while reducing our costs our competitiveness is also affected by the quality of our customer service and technical support and our ability to design customized products that address each customer’s particular requirements within their cost limitations the selection process for our products to be included in our customers’ products is highly competitive and our customers provide no guarantees that our products will be included in the nextgeneration of products introduced 

mp competes primarily with broadcom limited murata manufacturing co ltd qualcomm technologies inc and skyworks solutions inc idp competes primarily with analog devices inc cree inc macom technology solutions inc nxp semiconductors nv silicon laboratories inc stmicroelectronics nv skyworks solutions inc and sumitomo electric device innovations 

many of our current and potential competitors have entrenched market positions and customer relationships established patents and other ip and substantial technological capabilities in some cases our competitors are also our customers or suppliers additionally many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing and marketing resources than we do which may allow them to implement new technologies and develop new products more quickly than we can 

intellectual property 

we believe our ip including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets is important to our business and we actively seek opportunities to leverage our ip portfolio to promote our business interests we also actively seek to monitor and protect our global ip rights and to deter unauthorized use of our ip and other assets such efforts can be difficult because of the absence of consistent international standards and laws moreover we respect the ip rights of others and have implemented policies and procedures to mitigate the risk of infringing or misappropriating thirdparty ip 

patent applications are filed within the us and in other countries where we have a market presence on occasion some applications do not mature into patents for various reasons including rejections based on prior art in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect ip rights to the same extent as us laws we have approximately 1973 patents that expire from 2020 to 2040 we also continue to acquire patents through acquisitions or direct prosecution efforts and engage in licensing transactions to secure the right to use thirdparties’ patents in view of our rapid innovation and product development and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes there is no guarantee that our products will not be obsolete before the related patents expire or are granted however we believe the duration and scope of our most relevant patents are sufficient to support our business which as a whole is not significantly dependent on any particular patent or other ip right as we expand our products and offerings we also seek to expand our patent prosecution efforts to cover such products 

we periodically register federal trademarks service marks and trade names that distinguish our product brand names in the market we also monitor these marks for their proper and intended use additionally we rely on nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our interest in confidential and proprietary information that gives us a competitive advantage including business strategies unpatented inventions designs and process technology such information is closely monitored and made available only to those employees whose responsibilities require access to the information 

employees 

on march 28 2020  we had more than 7900 employees we believe that our future prospects will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain skilled employees competition for skilled personnel is intense and the number of persons with relevant experience particularly in rf engineering product design and technical marketing is limited none of our us employees are represented by a labor union some of our employees in 

germany and the netherlands are represented by internal works councils and some of our employees in china are represented by a labor union as of march 28 2020  approximately 12 of our global workforce was represented by a works council or labor union we have never experienced any work stoppage and we believe that our current employee relations are good 

  

environmental matters 

by virtue of operating our wafer fabrication facilities we are subject to a variety of extensive and changing domestic and international federal state and local governmental laws regulations and ordinances related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in the manufacturing process we pretreat and dispose of our wastewater from our manufacturing facilities to meet or exceed regulatory requirements our hazardous waste is sent to only licensed and permitted disposal facilities state agencies require us to report storage and emissions of environmentally hazardous materials and we have retained appropriate personnel to help ensure compliance with all applicable environmental regulations we believe that costs arising from existing environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

we are an iso 140012015 certified manufacturer with a comprehensive environmental management system ems in place to help ensure control of the environmental aspects of the manufacturing process our ems mandates compliance and establishes appropriate checks and balances to minimize the potential for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations 

we actively monitor the hazardous materials that are used in the manufacture assembly and test of our products particularly materials that are retained in the final product we have developed specific restrictions on the content of certain hazardous materials in our products as well as those of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers and subcontractors this helps to ensure that our products are compliant with the requirements of the markets into which the products will be sold and with our customers’ requirements for example our products are compliant with the european union rohs directive 201165eu on the restriction of use of hazardous substances which prohibits the sale in the european union market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing certain families of substances above a specified threshold 

historically the costs to comply with applicable environmental regulations have not been material and we currently do not expect the costs of complying with existing environmental regulations to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity capital resources or financial condition in fiscal 2021

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially impacted by any of these risks the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time may impair our business operations financial condition or results of operations 

our operating results fluctuate 

our revenue earnings margins and other operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future if demand for our products fluctuates as a result of economic conditions or for other reasons our revenue and profitability could be impacted our future operating results will depend on many factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is likely that our future operating results could be adversely affected by one or more of the factors set forth above or other similar factors if our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market analysts or our investors our stock price may decline 

our operating results are substantially dependent on development of new products and achieving design wins as our industry’s product life cycles are short and our customers requirements change rapidly 

our largest markets are characterized by short product life cycles and the frequent introduction of new products in response to evolving product requirements driven by end user demand for more functionality improved performance lower costs and a variety of form factors our largest mp customers typically refresh some or all of their product portfolios by releasing new models each year in some cases product designs we pursue represent either opportunities to substantially increase our revenue by winning a new design or a risk of a substantial revenue loss by losing an incumbent product in a customers device 

our success is dependent on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely and costeffective manner and secure production orders from our customers the development of new products is a highly complex process and we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products at times in the past our successful product development depends on a number of factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to design and introduce new products in a timely or costefficient manner and our new products may fail to meet market or customer requirements most major product design opportunities that we pursue involve multiple competitors and we could lose a new product design opportunity to a competitor that offers a lower cost or equal or superior performing product if we are unsuccessful in achieving design wins our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected even when a design win is achieved our success is not assured design wins may require significant expenditures by us and typically precede volume revenue by six to nine months or more many customers seek a second source for all major components in their devices which can significantly reduce the revenue obtained from a design win in many cases the average selling prices of our products decline over the products’ lives and we must achieve yield improvements cost reductions and other productivity enhancements in order to maintain profitability the actual value of a design win to us will ultimately depend on the commercial success of our customers’ products 

we depend on a few large customers for a substantial portion of our revenue 

a substantial portion of our mp revenue comes from large purchases by a small number of customers our future operating results depend on both the success of our largest customers and on our success in diversifying our products and customer base collectively our two largest end customers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 43  47 and 44 of our revenue for fiscal years 2020  2019 and 2018  respectively 

the concentration of our revenue with a relatively small number of customers makes us particularly dependent on factors both positive and negative affecting those customers if demand for their products increases our results are favorably impacted while if demand for their products decreases they may reduce their purchases of or stop purchasing our products and our operating results would suffer even if we achieve a design win our customers can delay or cancel the release of a new handset for any reason most of our customers can cease incorporating our products into their devices with little notice to us and with little or no penalty the loss of a large customer and failure to add new customers to replace lost revenue would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face risks of a loss of revenue if contracts with the united states government or defense and aerospace contractors are canceled or delayed or if defense spending is reduced 

we receive a portion of our revenue from the united states government and from prime contractors on united states governmentsponsored programs principally for defense and aerospace applications these programs are subject to delays or cancellation further spending on defense and aerospace programs can vary significantly depending on funding from the united states government we believe our government and defense and aerospace business has been negatively affected in the past by external factors such as sequestration and political pressure to reduce federal defense spending reductions in defense and aerospace funding or the loss of a significant defense and aerospace program or contract would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

the covid19 outbreak could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

covid19 has spread globally and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns these measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers we have significant manufacturing operations in the us and china and both of these countries have been affected by the outbreak and have taken measures to try to contain it there is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures and restrictions on our access to our manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce or similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers and restrictions or disruptions of transportation such as reduced availability of air transport port closures and increased border controls or closures could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty the outbreak and continued spread of covid19 will cause an economic slowdown and it is possible that the global economy worsens further the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including employee travel employee work locations and cancellation of events and conferences and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed 

the degree to which covid19 impacts our results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume 

we depend heavily on third parties 

we purchase numerous component parts substrates and siliconbased products from external suppliers we also utilize thirdparty suppliers for numerous services including die processing wafer bumping test and tape and reel the use of external suppliers involves a number of risks including the possibility of material disruptions in the supply of key components and the lack of control over delivery schedules capacity constraints manufacturing yields product quality and fabrication costs furthermore the covid19 outbreak has created heightened risk that external suppliers may be unable to perform their obligations to us or suffer financial distress due to the economic impact of the outbreak and the regulatory measures that have been enacted by governments to contain the virus 

although our key suppliers commit to us to be compliant with applicable iso 9001 andor ts16949 quality standards we have experienced quality and reliability issues with suppliers in the past quality or reliability issues in our supply chain could negatively affect our products our reputation and our results of operations 

we face risks related to sales through distributors 

we sell a significant portion of our products through thirdparty distributors we depend on these distributors to help us create end customer demand provide technical support and other valueadded services to customers fill customer orders and stock our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products may be limited because our end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor due to advantages in the incumbent distributors’ technical support and favorable business terms related to payments discounts and stocking of acceptable inventory levels using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks including competitive pressure concentration credit risk and compliance risks other third parties may use one of our distributors to sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to the distributors to focus them on the sale of our products our distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by our distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

we face risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing facilities 

we operate wafer fabrication facilities in north carolina oregon and texas we currently use several international and domestic assembly suppliers as well as internal assembly facilities in china costa rica germany and the us to assemble and test our products we currently have our own test and tape and reel facilities located in china costa rica and the us and we also utilize contract suppliers and partners in asia to test our products 

a number of factors related to our facilities will affect our business and financial results including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs 

our worldwide operations and business could be disrupted by natural disasters industrial accidents cybersecurity incidents telecommunications failures power or water shortages extreme weather conditions public health issues including the covid19 outbreak military actions acts of terrorism political or regulatory issues and other manmade disasters or catastrophic events global climate change could result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity such as drought wildfires storms and flooding we carry commercial property damage and business interruption insurance against various risks with limits we deem adequate for reimbursement for damage to our fixed assets and resulting disruption of our operations however the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses any disruptions from these events could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations and could also have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results to the extent that losses are uninsured or exceed insurance recoveries and to the extent that such disruptions adversely impact our relationships with our customers furthermore even if our own operations are unaffected or recover quickly if our customers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a business disruption natural disaster or catastrophic event they may reduce or cancel their orders which may adversely affect our results of operations 

if we experience poor manufacturing yields our operating results may suffer 

our products have unique designs and are fabricated using multiple semiconductor process technologies that are highly complex in many cases our products are assembled in customized packages many of our products consist of multiple components in a single module and feature enhanced levels of integration and complexity our customers insist that our products be designed to meet their exact specifications for quality performance and reliability our manufacturing yield is a combination of yields across the entire supply chain including wafer fabrication assembly and test yields defects in a single component in an assembled module product can impact the yield for the entire module which means the adverse economic impacts of an individual defect can be multiplied many times over if we fail to discover the defect before the module is assembled due to the complexity of our products we periodically experience difficulties in achieving acceptable yields and other quality issues particularly with respect to new products 

our customers test our products once they have been assembled into their products the number of usable products that result from our production process can fluctuate as a result of many factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we constantly seek to improve our manufacturing yields typically for a given level of sales when our yields improve our gross margins improve and when our yields decrease our unit costs are higher our margins are lower and our operating results are adversely affected 

costs of product defects and deviations from required specifications include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these costs could be significant and could reduce our gross margins our reputation with customers also could be damaged as a result of product defects and quality issues and product demand could be reduced which could harm our business and financial results 

we are subject to inventory risks and costs because we build our products based on forecasts provided by customers before receiving purchase orders for the products 

in order to ensure availability of our products for some of our largest end customers we start manufacturing certain products in advance of receiving purchase orders based on forecasts provided by these customers however these forecasts do not represent binding purchase commitments and we do not recognize sales for these products until they are shipped to or consumed by the customer as a result we incur significant inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales because demand for our products may not materialize or may be lower than expected manufacturing based on forecasts subjects us to heightened risks of higher inventory carrying costs increased obsolescence and higher operating costs these inventory risks are exacerbated when our customers purchase indirectly through contract manufacturers or hold component inventory levels greater than their consumption rate because this reduces our visibility regarding the customers’ accumulated levels of inventory if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory which would have a negative impact on our gross margin and other operating results 

we sell certain of our products based on reference designs of platform providers and our inability to effectively manage or maintain our evolving relationships with these companies may have an adverse effect on our business 

platform providers are typically large companies that provide system reference designs for oems and odms that include the platform provider’s baseband and other complementary products a platform provider may own or control ip that gives it a strong market position for its baseband products for certain air interface standards which provides it with significant influence and control over sales of rf products for these standards platform providers historically looked to us and our competitors to provide rf products to their customers as part of the overall system design and we competed with other rf companies to have our products included in the platform provider’s system reference design this market dynamic has evolved as platform providers have worked to develop more fully integrated solutions that include their own rf technologies and components 

platform providers may be in a different business from ours or we may be their customer or direct competitor accordingly we must balance our interest in obtaining new business with competitive and other factors because platform providers control the overall system reference design if they offer competitive rf technologies or their own rf solutions as a part of their reference design and exclude our products from the design we are at a distinct competitive disadvantage with oems and odms that are seeking a turnkey design solution even if our products offer superior performance this requires us to work more closely with oems and odms to secure the design of our products in their handsets and other devices 

our relationships with platform providers are complex and evolving and the inability to effectively manage or maintain these relationships could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to risks from international sales and operations 

we operate globally with sales offices and rd activities as well as manufacturing assembly and test facilities in multiple countries and some of our business activities are concentrated in asia as a result we are subject to regulatory geopolitical and other risks associated with doing business outside the us including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sales to customers located outside the us accounted for approximately 55 of our revenue in fiscal 2020  of which approximately 34 and 5 were attributable to sales to customers located in china and taiwan respectively we expect that revenue from international sales to china and other markets will continue to be a significant part of our total revenue any weakness in the chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for consumer products that contain our products which could materially and adversely affect our business the imposition by the us of tariffs on goods imported from china countermeasures imposed by china in response us export restrictions on sales of products to china and other government actions that restrict or otherwise adversely affect our ability to sell our products to chinese customers could increase our manufacturing costs and reduce our product sales in china and other markets 

as a global company our results are affected by movements in currency exchange rates our exposure may increase or decrease over time as our foreign business levels fluctuate in the countries where we have operations and these changes could have a material impact on our financial results the functional currency for most of our international operations is the us dollar we have foreign operations in asia europe and central america and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the us our international revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars operating expenses and certain working capital items related to our foreignbased operations are in some instances denominated in the local foreign currencies and therefore are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies such as the costa rican colon euro pound sterling renminbi and singapore dollar if the us dollar weakens compared to these and other currencies our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when remeasured back into us dollars 

economic regulation in china could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we have a significant portion of our assembly and testing capacity in china for many years the chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid growth and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation in response to these factors the chinese government has from time to time adopted measures to regulate growth and to contain inflation including currency controls and measures designed to restrict credit control prices or set currency exchange rates such actions in the future as well as other changes in chinese laws and regulations including actions in furtherance of china’s stated policy of reducing its dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers could increase the cost of doing business in china foster the emergence of chinesebased competitors decrease the demand for our products in china or reduce the supply of critical materials for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

changes in government trade policies including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions could limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the us or foreign governments may take administrative legislative or regulatory action that could materially interfere with our ability to sell products in certain countries particularly in china for example between july 2018 and june 2019 the office of the united states trade representative imposed 25 tariffs on specified product lists including certain electronic components and equipment totaling approximately 250 billion in chinese imports in response china imposed or proposed new or higher tariffs on us products the us government also imposed 15 tariffs on an additional 120 billion of chinese imports with china imposing retaliatory tariffs while the imposition of these tariffs did not have a direct material adverse impact on our business during fiscal year 2020 the direct and indirect effects of tariffs and other restrictive trade policies are difficult to measure and are only one part of a larger uschina economic and trade policy disagreement for example imposition of tariffs on our customers’ products that are imported from china to the us could harm sales of such products which would harm 

our business we cannot predict what further actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the us and china or other countries what products may be subject to such actions or what actions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation 

furthermore we have experienced restrictions on our ability to sell products to certain foreign customers where sales of products require export licenses or are prohibited by government action the us government has in the past issued export restrictions that effectively banned american companies from selling products to zte corporation one of our customers and in may 2019 the bureau of industry bis and security of the us department of commerce added huawei technologies co ltd and over 100 of its affiliates to the “entity list” maintained by the department huawei accounted for 10  15 and 8 of our total revenue during fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively while we subsequently restarted shipments to huawei of certain products from outside the us that are not subject to the export administration regulations ear and while we have also applied for a license to ship other products that are subject to the ear as required by the rules governing the entity list our sales to huawei will continue to be impacted by trade restrictions 

as of the date of this report we are unable to predict the scope and duration of the export restrictions imposed on huawei and the corresponding future effects on our business even if such restrictions are lifted any financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed on huawei could have a continuing negative impact on our future revenue and results of operations in addition huawei or other foreign customers affected by future us government sanctions or threats of sanctions may respond by developing their own solutions to replace our products or by adopting our foreign competitors’ solutions 

moreover us government actions targeting exports of certain technologies to china are becoming more pervasive for example in 2018 the us adopted new laws designed to address concerns about the export of emerging and foundational technologies to china in addition in may 2019 an executive order was issued that invoked national emergency economic powers to implement a framework to regulate the acquisition or transfer of information communications technology in transactions that imposed undue national security risks these actions could lead to additional restrictions on the export of products that include or enable certain technologies including products we provide to chinabased customers 

the loss or temporary loss of huawei or other foreign customers or the imposition of restrictions on our ability to sell products to such customers as a result of tariffs export restrictions or other us regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our sales business and results of operations 

we operate in a very competitive industry and must continue to implement innovative technologies 

we compete with several companies primarily engaged in the business of designing manufacturing and selling rf solutions as well as suppliers of discrete integrated circuits and modules in addition to our direct competitors some of our largest end customers and leading platform partners also compete with us to some extent by designing and manufacturing their own products increased competition from any source could adversely affect our operating results through lower prices for our products reduced demand for our products losses of existing design slots with key customers and a corresponding reduction in our ability to recover development engineering and manufacturing costs 

many of our existing and potential competitors have entrenched market positions historical affiliations with oems considerable internal manufacturing capacity established ip rights and substantial technological capabilities the semiconductor industry has experienced increased industry consolidation over the last several years a trend we expect to continue many of our existing and potential competitors may have greater financial technical manufacturing or marketing resources than we do we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully with our competitors 

industry overcapacity could cause us to underutilize our manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

it is difficult to predict future demand for our products which makes it difficult to estimate future requirements for production capacity and avoid periods of overcapacity fluctuations in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products also can lead to overcapacity and contribute to cyclicality in the semiconductor market 

capacity expansion projects have long lead times and require capital commitments based on forecasted product trends and demand well in advance of production orders from customers in recent years we have made significant capital investments to expand our premium filter capacity to address forecasted future demand patterns in certain cases these capacity additions exceeded the nearterm demand requirements leading to overcapacity situations and underutilization of our manufacturing facilities 

as many of our manufacturing costs are fixed these costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues experienced during periods of underutilization underutilization of our manufacturing facilities can adversely affect our gross margin and other operating results if demand for our products experiences a prolonged decrease we may be required to close or idle facilities and write down our longlived assets or shorten the useful lives of underutilized assets and accelerate depreciation which would increase our expenses for example to address manufacturing overcapacity in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we commenced a phased closure of a saw filter manufacturing facility in florida and a transfer of production to our north carolina facility which was completed in fiscal 2020 also in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we announced the temporary idling of a baw manufacturing facility in texas these actions resulted in impairment charges accelerated depreciation and other restructuring related charges and expenses 

we may not be able to borrow funds under our credit facility or secure future financing 

on december 5 2017 we entered into a fiveyear unsecured senior credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement with bank of america na as administrative agent swing line lender and lc issuer and a syndicate of lenders as amended the credit agreement the credit agreement includes a 3000 million revolving credit facility which is available for working capital capital expenditures and other corporate purposes the credit agreement contains various conditions covenants and representations with which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds we cannot assure that we will be in compliance with these conditions covenants and representations in the future when we may need to borrow funds under this facility 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt including our notes or to fund capital expenditures and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our debt obligations and financing requirements which may not be successful or on terms favorable to us 

the credit agreement includes a 4000 million senior delayed draw term loan the term loan of which 1000 million was funded at closing and then subsequently repaid during march 2018 on june 17 2019 the company drew 1000 million of the term loan the delayed draw availability period for the remaining 2000 million of the term loan expired on december 31 2019 we may request one or more additional tranches of term loans or increases in the revolving credit facility up to an aggregate of 3000 million and subject to securing additional funding commitments from the existing or new lenders 

in november 2015 we issued 5500 million aggregate principal amount of 700 senior notes due 2025 the 2025 notes pursuant to an indenture dated as of november 19 2015 as supplemented the 2015 indenture we subsequently completed the repurchase of all but 234 million of the 2025 notes additionally in july 2018 august 2018 and march 2019 we issued 5000 million  1300 million and 2700 million  respectively aggregate principal amount of 550 senior notes due 2026 the 2026 notes pursuant to an indenture dated as of july 16 2018 as supplemented the “2018 indenture” in september 2019 and december 2019 we issued 3500 million and 2000 million  respectively aggregate principal amount of 4375 senior notes due 2029 the “2029 notes” and together with the 2025 notes and the 2026 notes the “notes” pursuant to an indenture dated as of september 30 2019 as supplemented the “2019 indenture” and together with the 2015 indenture and the 2018 indenture the “indentures” 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations including the term loan and the notes and to fund working capital planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts and any strategic alliances or acquisitions we may make in the future depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we cannot be sure that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay our debt including the term loan and the notes if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may face liquidity issues and be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital 

or restructure or refinance our debt these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service and other obligations additionally the credit agreement and the indentures limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition as a result we may not be allowed under these documents to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy our debt service obligations further we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt at or before maturity and we cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the agreements and instruments governing our debt impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility 

the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the term loan and the indentures governing the notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these covenants could have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete in addition the credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants operating results below current levels or other adverse factors including a significant increase in interest rates could result in our being unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in our revolving credit facility if we violate covenants under the credit agreement and are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders our debt under our revolving credit facility would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders because of crossdefault provisions in the agreements and instruments governing our debt a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under and the acceleration of our other debt if our debt is accelerated we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if we are able to obtain new financing it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us if our debt is in default for any reason our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions 

the price of our common stock has recently been and may in the future be volatile 

the price of our common stock which is traded on the nasdaq global select market has been and may continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in addition the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we cannot assure that the price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future in addition the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to our performance 

damage to our reputation or brand could negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with customers employees governments suppliers and other stakeholders if we fail to address issues that give rise to reputational risk including those described throughout this “risk factors” section we could significantly harm our reputation and our brand our reputation may also be damaged by how we respond to corporate crises corporate crises can arise from catastrophic events as well as from incidents involving product quality security or safety issues allegations of unethical behavior or misconduct or legal noncompliance internal control failures corporate governance issues data or privacy breaches workplace safety incidents environmental incidents the use of our products for illegal or objectionable applications media statements the conduct of our suppliers or representatives and other issues or incidents that whether actual or perceived result in adverse publicity if we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address such crises the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brands and could lead to litigation or subject us to regulatory actions or restrictions damage to our reputation could harm customer relations reduce demand for our products reduce investor confidence in us adversely affect our stock price and may also limit our ability to be seen as an employer of choice when competing for highly skilled employees moreover repairing our reputation and brands may be difficult timeconsuming and expensive 

we may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases 

we are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program and the program may be modified suspended or terminated at any time without notice the amount and timing of our stock repurchases may vary based on a number of factors including our priorities regarding the use of our cash such as capital investments and acquisitions restrictions under securities laws and existing debt agreements the availability of attractive financing sources and the optimization of our capital structure as well as changes in our cash flows tax laws and the market price of our common stock 

our recent and future acquisitions and other strategic investments could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives disrupt our ongoing business and adversely impact our results of operations 

as part of our business strategy and as demonstrated in our recent acquisitions we expect to continue to review potential acquisitions and strategic investments that could complement our current product offerings augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth or margin improvement 

opportunities in the event of future acquisitions of businesses products or technologies we could issue equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership incur substantial debt or other financial obligations or assume contingent liabilities such actions could harm our results of operations or the price of our common stock acquisitions and strategic investments also entail numerous other risks that could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moreover our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs accordingly if we pursue a particular transaction we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows particularly in the case of a large acquisition 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate key employees and our failure to do so could harm our business and our results of operations 

in order to compete effectively we must 

 

 

 

 

our future operating results and success depend on keeping key technical personnel and management and expanding our sales and marketing rd and administrative support we do not have employment agreements with the vast majority of our employees we must also continue to attract qualified personnel the competition for qualified personnel is intense and the number of people with experience particularly in rf engineering integrated circuit and filter design and technical marketing and support is limited in addition existing or new immigration laws policies or regulations in the us may limit the pool of available talent travel bans difficulties obtaining visas and other restrictions on international travel could make it more difficult to effectively manage our international operations operate as a global company or service our international customer base changes in the interpretation and 

application of employmentrelated laws to our workforce practices may also result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain skilled personnel in the future which could harm our business and our results of operations 

we rely on our intellectual property portfolio and may not be able to successfully protect against the use of our intellectual property by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that patents will be issued in all countries where our products can be sold further we cannot be certain that any claims allowed from pending applications will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection against our competitors our competitors may also be able to design around our patents 

the laws of some countries in which our products are developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws this increases the possibility of misappropriation or infringement of our technology and products although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology additionally our competitors may be able to independently develop noninfringing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours 

we may need to engage in legal actions to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights generally intellectual property litigation is both expensive and unpredictable our involvement in intellectual property litigation could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights 

our operating results may be adversely affected if third parties were to assert claims that our products infringed their patent copyright or other intellectual property rights such assertions could lead to expensive and unpredictable litigation diverting the attention of management and technical personnel an unsuccessful result in any such litigation could have adverse effects on our business which may include injunctions exclusion orders and royalty payments to third parties in addition if one of our customers or another supplier to one of our customers were found to be infringing on thirdparty intellectual property rights such finding could adversely affect the demand for our products 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our proprietary information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

we rely on trade secrets technical knowhow and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities to provide us with competitive advantages we protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants strategic partners and other third parties we also design our computer networks and implement various procedures to restrict unauthorized access to dissemination of our proprietary information 

we face internal and external data security threats current departing or former employees or third parties could attempt to improperly use or access our computer systems and networks to copy obtain or misappropriate our proprietary information or otherwise interrupt our business like others we are also subject to significant system or network disruptions from numerous causes including computer viruses and other cyberattacks facility access issues new system implementations and energy blackouts 

security breaches computer malware phishing spoofing and other cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years while we defend against these threats on a daily basis we do not believe that such attacks to date have caused us any material damage because the techniques used by computer hackers and others to access or sabotage networks constantly evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate counter or ameliorate all of these techniques as a result our and our customers proprietary information may be misappropriated and the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted any loss of such information could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence in the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the incident and divert management and other resources we routinely implement 

improvements to our network security safeguards and we are devoting increasing resources to the security of our information technology systems we cannot however assure that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future cyberattack or network disruptions 

the costs related to cyberattacks or other security threats or computer systems disruptions typically would not be fully insured or indemnified by others occurrence of any of the events described above could result in loss of competitive advantages derived from our rd efforts or our ip moreover these events may result in the early obsolescence of our products product development delays or diversion of the attention of management and key information technology and other resources or otherwise adversely affect our internal operations and reputation or degrade our financial results and stock price 

we may be subject to theft loss or misuse of personal data by or about our employees customers or other third parties which could increase our expenses damage our reputation or result in legal or regulatory proceedings 

in the ordinary course of our business we have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information regarding our employees and others that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business or by our thirdparty service providers including business process software applications providers and other vendors that have access to sensitive data could result in damage to our reputation disruption of our business activities significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims 

global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment for example the european union has adopted the general data protection regulation gdpr which requires companies to comply with rules regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices complying with these changing laws has caused and could continue to cause us to incur substantial costs which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations further failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity finally even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in audits regulatory inquiries or proceedings against us by governmental entities or others 

we are subject to warranty claims product recalls and product liability 

from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expense we may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters and our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims 

product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and such insurance may be unavailable or inadequate to protect against all claims if one of our customers recalls a product containing one of our devices we may incur significant costs and expenses including replacement costs direct and indirect product recallrelated costs diversion of technical and other resources and reputational harm our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions relating to product quality issues the potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant and in some cases including in agreements with some of our largest end customers are potentially unlimited any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from sale of the relevant products costs payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to risks associated with environmental health and safety regulations and climate change 

we are subject to a broad array of us and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations include those related to the use transportation storage handling emission discharge and 

recycling or disposal of hazardous materials used in our manufacturing assembly and testing processes our failure to comply with any of these existing or future laws or regulations could result in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existing and future environmental laws and regulations could also impact our product designs and limit or restrict the materials or components that are included in our products in addition many of our largest end customers require us to comply with corporate social responsibility policies which often include employment health safety environmental and other requirements that exceed applicable legal requirements compliance with these policies increases our operating expenses and noncompliance can adversely affect customer relationships and harm our business 

new climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or procure substitute raw materials that may cost more or be more difficult to procure in addition new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in increased costs for us and our suppliers various jurisdictions are developing other climate changebased regulations that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results we expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future future compliance with these laws and regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

compliance with regulations regarding the use of “conflict minerals” could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

regulations in the us currently require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products referred to as conflict minerals originated in the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries or were from recycled or scrap sources we may face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently make any required determination that the metals used in our products are conflict free 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying deterring preventing or rendering more difficult a change in control of qorvo that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests these provisions include 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the general corporation law of the state of delaware contains provisions that regulate “business combinations” between corporations and interested stockholders who own 15 or more of the corporation’s voting stock except under certain circumstances these provisions could also discourage potential acquisition proposals and delay or prevent a change in control 

these provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit of any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context and may also make it more difficult for a third party to replace directors on our board of directors further the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 

our operating results could vary as a result of the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see critical accounting policies and estimates in part ii item 7 of this report such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments that could significantly affect our results of operations 

decisions we make about the scope of our future operations could affect our future financial results 

from time to time changes in the business environment have led us to change the scope of our operations or business which has resulted in restructuring and asset impairment charges and this could occur in the future the amount and timing of such charges can be difficult to predict factors that contribute to the amount and timing of such charges include 

 

 

 

 

changes in our effective tax rate may adversely impact our results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in china germany singapore the us and numerous other foreign taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuations as it is impacted by a number of factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 



any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

changes in the favorable tax status of our subsidiaries in singapore and costa rica would have an adverse impact on our operating results 

our subsidiaries in singapore and costa rica have been granted tax holidays that effectively minimize our tax expense and that are expected to be effective through december 2021 and december 2027 respectively in their efforts to deal with budget deficits governments around the world are focusing on increasing tax revenues through increased audits and potentially increased tax rates for corporations as part of this effort governments continue to review their policies on granting tax holidays in february 2017 singapore enacted legislation that will exclude from our existing development and expansion incentive grant the benefit of the reduced tax rate for intellectual property income earned after june 30 2021 future changes in the status of either tax holiday could have a negative effect on our net income in future years 

the enactment of international or domestic tax legislation or changes in regulatory guidance may adversely impact our results of operations 

corporate tax reform baseerosion efforts and increased tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions in which we have business operations in 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which included a number of changes to us tax laws that impacted us including the onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the “transitional repatriation tax” and the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” provisions in addition other countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and action plan which aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder tax transfer pricing documentations rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices legislative changes interpretations and guidance and changes in prior tax rulings and decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes resulting from these initiatives could increase our effective tax rate and result in taxes we previously paid being subject to change which may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations

income tax expense benefit 

income tax expense for fiscal 2020 was 608 million  this was primarily comprised of tax expense related to international operations generating pretax book income the impact of the tax acts gilti provisions the reversal of the permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to certain unrepatriated foreign earnings and an increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits offset by a tax benefit related to domestic and international operations generating pretax book losses and domestic tax credits for fiscal 2020  this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 154  

income tax benefit for fiscal 2019 was 413 million  this was primarily comprised of tax benefits related to domestic and international operations generating pretax book losses tax credits adjustments related to provisional estimates for the impact of the tax act and a decrease in gross unrecognized tax benefits offset by tax expenses related to international operations generating pretax book income and tax expense related to the gilti inclusions for fiscal 2019  this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 450  

a valuation allowance has been established against deferred tax assets in the taxing jurisdictions where based upon the positive and negative evidence available it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized realization is dependent upon generating future income in the taxing jurisdictions in which the operating loss carryovers credit carryovers depreciable tax basis and other deferred tax assets exist management reevaluates the ability to realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis as of the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019  the valuation allowance against domestic and foreign deferred tax assets was 353 million and 404 million  respectively 

see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding income taxes

as of march 28 2020  total remaining unearned compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units was 874 million  which will be amortized over the weightedaverage remaining service period of approximately 13 years  

liquidity and capital resources 

cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity as of march 28 2020  we had working capital of approximately 11515 million  including 7149 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to working capital of 12492 million  including 7110 million in cash and cash equivalents as of march 30 2019  

our 7149 million of total cash and cash equivalents as of march 28 2020  includes approximately 3453 million held by our foreign subsidiaries of which 2664 million is held by qorvo international pte ltd in singapore if the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are needed in the us we may be required to pay state income andor foreign local withholding taxes to repatriate these earnings 

at this time we are not able to estimate the longterm impact of the covid19 outbreak on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flow we believe we have sufficient liquidity available from operating cash flow cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility however as the situation evolves we will continue to assess our liquidity needs evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions

see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report for further information about the credit agreement including applicable interest rates and financial covenants as of march 28 2020  we were in compliance with all the financial covenants under the credit agreement 

stock repurchases 

on october 31 2019 we announced that our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to 10 billion of our outstanding common stock which included approximately 1170 million authorized under the prior program which was terminated concurrent with the new authorization under this program share repurchases are made in accordance with applicable securities laws on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the extent to which we repurchase our shares the number of shares and the timing of any repurchases depends on general market conditions regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other considerations the program does not require us to repurchase a minimum number of shares does not have a fixed term and may be modified suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice 

we repurchased 64 million shares 91 million shares and 29 million shares of our common stock during fiscal years 2020  2019 and 2018  respectively at an aggregate cost of 5151 million  6381 million and 2199 million  respectively in accordance with the current and prior share repurchase programs as of march 28 2020  7659 million remains available for future repurchases under our current share repurchase program 

cash flows from operating activities 

operating activities in fiscal 2020 provided cash of 9456 million  compared to 8104 million in fiscal 2019  this yearoveryear increase was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital driven by improvements in days sales outstanding and improved inventory management in fiscal 2020  

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 was 11057 million  compared to 2476 million in fiscal 2019  this yearoveryear increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of activesemi cavendish custom mmic and decawave in fiscal 2020  

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2020 was 1656 million  compared to net cash used in financing activities of 7767 million in fiscal 2019  in fiscal 2019 cash disbursed in connection with the retirement of all of the 2023 notes and a majority of the 2025 notes was partially offset by cash proceeds received from the issuance of the 2026 notes during fiscal 2020 we received cash proceeds of 5590 million from the issuance of the 2029 notes and 1000 million from the draw on the term loan 

our future capital requirements may differ materially from those currently anticipated and will depend on many factors including market acceptance of and demand for our products acquisition opportunities technological advances and our relationships with suppliers and customers based on current and projected levels of cash flow from operations coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents and our credit facility we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet both our shortterm and longterm cash requirements however if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products or if our revenue grows faster than we anticipate operating cash flows may be insufficient to meet our needs if existing resources and cash from operations are not sufficient to meet our future requirements or if we perceive conditions to be favorable we may seek additional debt or equity financing additional equity or debt financing could be dilutive to holders of our common stock further we cannot be sure that additional equity or debt financing if required will be available on favorable terms if at all 

impact of inflation 

we do not believe that the effects of inflation had a significant impact on our revenue or operating income during fiscal years 2020 and 2019  however there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of march 28 2020  we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

1 includes current receivable from nonguarantors of 4842 million  

2 includes noncurrent payable to nonguarantors of 2499 million  



critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to use judgment and estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management our critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies however these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report 

inventory reserves the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons generally 12 to 24 months the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory reserves are the same as those used in our revenue forecasts and are also consistent with the estimates used in our manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base market conditions and customer acceptance of our products and technologies as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost 

historically inventory reserves have fluctuated as new technologies have been introduced and customers’ demand has shifted inventory reserves had an impact on margins of less than 2 in fiscal years 2020 and 2019  

property and equipment periodically we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property and equipment considering factors such as changes in machinery and equipment technology our ability to reuse equipment across generations of process technology and historical usage trends when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the revised useful lives of the assets 

we assess property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset group may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include an adverse change in our use of the assets or an expectation that the assets will be sold or otherwise disposed we assess the recoverability of the assets held and used by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts assets identified as held for sale are recorded at the lesser of their carrying value or their fair market value less costs to sell impairment if any is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets the process of evaluating property and equipment for impairment is highly subjective and requires significant judgment as we are required to make assumptions about items such as future demand for our products and industry trends 

business acquisitions we record goodwill when the consideration paid for a business acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is assigned to our reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination 

a number of assumptions estimates and judgments are used in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities particularly with respect to the intangible assets acquired the valuation of intangible assets requires our use of valuation techniques such as the income approach the income approach includes management’s estimation of future cash flows including expected revenue growth rates and profitability the underlying product or technology life cycles and the discount rates applied to future cash flows 

further judgment is required in estimating the fair values of deferred tax assets and liabilities uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date as well as inventory property and equipment preexisting liabilities or legal claims deferred revenue and contingent consideration each as may be applicable 

while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 

goodwill we perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level on the first day of the fourth quarter in each fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist reporting units as defined by asc 350  intangibles  goodwill and other may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment referred to as a component we have determined that our reporting units are our two operating and reportable segments mp and idp 

in accordance with asc 350 we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill 

in performing a qualitative assessment we consider i our overall historical and projected future operating results ii if there was a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period iii if there was a significant change in our market capitalization relative to our net book value and iv if there was a prolonged or more significant slowdown in the worldwide economy of the semiconductor industry as well as other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit if we assess these qualitative factors and conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we decide not to perform a qualitative assessment then a quantitative impairment test is performed 

in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 we completed qualitative assessments and concluded that based on the relevant facts and circumstances it was more likely than not that each reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its related carrying value and no further impairment testing was required 

in fiscal 2020 we performed a quantitative impairment test our quantitative impairment test considered both the income approach and the market approach to estimate each reporting unit’s fair value under the income approach the fair value of each reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on our estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the businesss ability to execute on the projected cash flows the market approach estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics the resulting fair value based on the income and market approaches is then compared to the carrying value to determine if impairment is necessary 

as a result of the quantitative analysis performed in fiscal 2020 it was determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values as the assumptions used in the income approach and market approach can have a material impact on the fair value determinations we performed a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions used in the assessment and determined that a one percentage point increase in the discount rate along with a one percentage point decrease in the longterm growth rate would not result in an impairment of goodwill for either reporting unit and their fair values substantially exceeded their carrying values 

identified intangible assets we amortize finitelived intangible assets including developed technology customer relationships trade names technology licenses and backlog over their estimated useful life inprocess research and development iprd assets represent the fair value of incomplete rd projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of the acquisition initially these are classified as iprd and are not subject to amortization upon completion of development iprd assets are transferred to developed technology and are amortized over their useful lives the asset balances relating to abandoned projects are impaired and expensed to rd we perform a quarterly review of significant intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and forecasts indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable if such facts and circumstances exist we assess the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts impairments if any are based on the excess of the carrying amounts over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the impairment determination was made 

revenue recognition we generate revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products either directly to a customer or to a distributor or at completion of a consignment process revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services a majority of our revenue is recognized at a point in time either on shipment or delivery of the product depending on individual customer terms and conditions revenue from sales to our distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors sellin revenue is recognized from our consignment programs at a point in time when the products are pulled from consignment inventory by the customer revenue recognized for products and services overtime is immaterial less than 2 of overall revenue we apply a fivestep approach as defined in asc 606  revenue from contracts with customers in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized 1 identifying the contract with a customer 2 identifying the performance obligations in the contract 3 determining the transaction price 4 allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognizing revenue when the corresponding performance obligation is satisfied 

sales agreements are in place with certain customers and contain terms and conditions with respect to payment delivery warranty and supply but typically do not require minimum purchase commitments in the absence of a sales agreement our standard terms and conditions apply we consider a customers 

purchase order which is governed by a sales agreement or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer 

our pricing terms are negotiated independently on a standalone basis in determining the transaction price we evaluate whether the price is subject to a refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled variable consideration in the form of rebate programs is offered to certain customers including distributors a majority of these rebates are accrued and classified as a contra accounts receivable and represent less than 5 of net revenue we determine variable consideration by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer our terms and conditions do not give our customers a right of return associated with the original sale of our products however we may authorize sales returns under certain circumstances which include courtesy returns and likekind exchanges sales returns are classified as a refund liability we reduce revenue and record reserves for product returns and allowances rebate programs and scrap allowance based on historical experience or specific identification depending on the contractual terms of the arrangement 

our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from our customers payments are due upon completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing substantially all payments are collected within our standard terms which do not include any financing components to date there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable contract assets and contract liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets were immaterial as of march 28 2020 and march 30 2019  

we invoice customers upon shipment and recognize revenues in accordance with delivery terms as of march 28 2020  we had 378 million in remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year of which the majority is expected to be recognized as income over the next 12 months 

we include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and include the related shipping costs in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations taxes assessed by government authorities on revenueproducing transactions including tariffs valueadded and excise taxes are excluded from revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 

we incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers sales commissions which are recorded in the selling general and administrative expense line item in the consolidated statements of operations are expensed when incurred because such commissions are not owed until the performance obligation is satisfied which coincides with the end of the contract term and therefore no remaining period exists over which to amortize the commissions 

income taxes in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense the resultant tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

as part of our financial process we assess on a tax jurisdictional basis the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not more likely than not a likelihood of less than 50 percent the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to ultimately be recoverable in this process certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the amount of income or loss in prior years the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies changes in taxable income market conditions us or international tax laws and other factors may change our judgment regarding whether we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets these changes if any may require material adjustments to the net deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding changes in the valuation allowance and net deferred tax assets 

as part of our financial process we also assess the likelihood that our tax reporting positions will ultimately be sustained to the extent it is determined it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of a tax reporting position will ultimately not be recognized and sustained a provision for unrecognized tax benefit is provided by either reducing the applicable deferred tax asset or accruing an income tax liability our judgment regarding the sustainability of our tax reporting positions may change in the future due to changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to the related deferred tax assets or accrued income tax liabilities and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions and the amount of unrecognized tax benefits

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity prices and certain commodity prices the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to seek a reduction in the potential negative earnings effects from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices arising from our business activities we manage these financial exposures through operational means and by using various financial instruments when deemed appropriate these practices may change as economic conditions change 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk via the terms of our credit facility which is comprised of a term loan and revolving facility with interest rates see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report the outstanding balance related to the credit facility as of march 28 2020 was 1000 million  a potential change in the associated interest rates would be immaterial to the results of our operations 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as a global company our results are affected by movements in currency exchange rates our exposure may increase or decrease over time as our foreign business levels fluctuate in the countries where we have operations and these changes could have a material impact on our financial results the functional currency for most of our international operations is the us dollar we have foreign operations in asia central america and europe and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the us our international revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars operating expenses and certain working capital items related to our foreignbased operations are in some instances denominated in the local foreign currencies and therefore are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies such as the costa rican colon euro pound sterling renminbi and singapore dollar if the us dollar weakens compared to these and other currencies our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when remeasured back into us dollars we seek to manage our foreign currency exchange risk in part through operational means 

for fiscal 2020  we incurred a foreign currency loss of 22 million as compared to a loss of 21 million in fiscal 2019  which is recorded in “other income expense” 

  

our financial instrument holdings including foreign receivables cash and payables at march 28 2020  were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes in this sensitivity analysis we assumed that the change in one currencys rate relative to the us dollar would not have an effect on other currencies rates relative to the us dollar all other factors were held constant if the us dollar declined in value 10 in relation to the remeasured foreign currency instruments our net income would have decreased by approximately 28 

million  if the us dollar increased in value 10 in relation to the remeasured foreign currency instruments our net income would have increased by approximately 23 million  

equity price risk 

our marketable equity investments in publicly traded companies are subject to equity market price risk accordingly a fluctuation in the price of each equity security could have an adverse impact on the fair value of our investments as of march 28 2020  our equity investments were immaterial see note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report 

commodity price risk 

we routinely use precious metals in the manufacture of our products supplies for such commodities may from time to time become restricted or general market factors and conditions may affect the pricing of such commodities we also have an active reclamation process to capture any unused gold while we attempt to mitigate the risk of increases in commoditiesrelated costs there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully safeguard against potential shortterm and longterm commodity price fluctuations

other markets 

we also participate in several smaller markets including broadband cable pointtopoint radio and very small aperture terminal applications our products for these markets range from pas to oscillators in addition we serve the traditional optical longhaul telecom networks that are the backbone of the nations fiber optic network our products include optical modulator drivers and transimpedance amplifiers which support data rates from 10 gigabits per second to 600 gigabits per second 

research and development 

we invest in research and development rd to develop the advanced technologies and products necessary to serve our markets our rd activities focus primarily on large competitive design win opportunities for major programs at key customers which typically requires us to improve the yearoveryear functional density performance size and cost of our products we also devote significant rd resources for targeted development of new products for general release to various markets our rd efforts require us to focus on both continuous improvement in our processes for design and manufacture as well as innovation in fundamental areas like materials software and firmware semiconductor process technologies simulation and modeling systems architecture circuit design device packaging module integration and test 

we have developed several generations of gaas gan baw and surface acoustic wave saw process technologies that we manufacture internally we invest in these technologies to improve device performance reduce die size and reduce manufacturing costs we also help develop and qualify technologies in cooperation with key suppliers including soi for switches and tuners silicon germanium sige for amplifiers and cmos for power management devices and soc solutions we combine these technologies with our proprietary design methods intellectual property and other expertise to improve performance increase integration and reduce the size and cost of our products 

we develop and qualify advanced packaging technologies to allow us to eliminate wire bonds reduce component size improve performance and reduce package costs we are also investing in large scale module assembly and test capabilities to bring these technologies to market in very high volumes 

raw materials 

we purchase numerous raw materials passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing processes for our gaas and gan manufacturing operations we use several raw materials including gaas and gan on silicon carbide wafers for our acoustic filter manufacturing operations we use several raw materials including wafers made from silicon lithium niobate or lithium tantalate 

for our siliconbased products we use thirdparty foundries high demand for silicon wafers and wafer starting materials has led to supply constraints from timetotime and we have attempted to address this by qualifying multiple silicon foundries and by obtaining supply commitments in some cases in exchange for purchase or capital commitments by us 

our manufacturing strategy includes a balance of internal and external sites primarily for assembly and test operations which helps reduce costs provides flexibility of supply and minimizes the risk of supply disruption we routinely qualify multiple sources of supply and manufacturing sites to reduce the risk of supply interruptions or price increases and closely monitor suppliers’ key performance indicators our suppliers and our manufacturing sites are geographically diversified with our largest volume sources distributed throughout southern and eastern asia we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing needs 

manufacturing 

we are a manufacturer of baw gan gaas saw tcsaw and silicon products the majority of our products are multichip modules utilizing multiple semiconductor and acoustic material processing technologies these products have varying degrees of complexity and contain semiconductors and other components that are manufactured inhouse or outsourced 

we operate wafer fabrication facilities for the production of baw gan gaas saw and tcsaw wafers in apopka florida greensboro north carolina hillsboro oregon and richardson texas we also use multiple siliconbased process technologies including soi sige and cmos we outsource all silicon manufacturing to leading silicon foundries located throughout the world we have a global supply chain and ship millions of units per day 

we have our own flip chip wire bond and waferlevel packaging wlp technologies additionally we use external suppliers for these and other packaging technologies 

once semiconductor wafers are manufactured they are singulated or separated into individual units called die prior to singulation of wafers into die we regularly conduct wafer level tests which could include electrical validation rf testing through the designed frequency bands as well as visual inspection for module products the next step is assembly during assembly the die and other components are placed on highdensity interconnect substrates to provide connectivity between the die and the components this populated substrate is formed into a microelectronic package next the products are tested for rf performance and prepared for shipment through a tape and reel process we primarily use internal assembly facilities in china costa rica germany and the us and we also utilize external suppliers we also manufacture large volumes of wlp die and discrete filters that our customers directly assemble into their products 

manufacturing yields can vary significantly between products based on a number of factors including product complexity and the maturity of our manufacturing processes to maximize wafer yields and quality we test products multiple times maintain continuous reliability monitoring and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the production flow 

our internal manufacturing facilities require a high level of fixed costs consisting primarily of occupancy costs maintenance repair equipment depreciation and fixed labor costs related to manufacturing and process engineering 

integrated circuits and filter products are highly complex and sensitive to contaminants and semiconductor fabrication requires highly controlled clean environments wafers can be rejected or die on a wafer can be found to be nonfunctional as a result of minute impurities variances in the fabrication process or defects in the masks used to transfer circuits onto the wafers 

our manufacturing facilities worldwide are certified to the iso 9001 quality standard and select locations are certified to additional automotive iatf 16949 aerospace as 9100 and environmental iso 14001 standards these stringent standards are audited and certified by thirdparty auditors in addition to our continuous internal selfaudits the iso 9001 standard is based on a number of quality management principles including a strong customer focus the motivation of top management the process approach and continual improvement iatf 16949 is the highest international quality standard for the global automotive industry and incorporates specific additional requirements for the automotive industry as 9100 is the standardized quality management system for the aerospace industry iso 14001 is an internationally agreed upon standard for an environmental management system we require that all of our key vendors and suppliers be compliant with select standards as applicable 

customers 

we design develop manufacture and market products for leading us and international oems and odms we also collaborate with leading baseband reference design partners 

we provide our products to our largest end customer apple inc apple through sales to multiple contract manufacturers which in the aggregate accounted for 32  36  and 34  of total revenue in fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively huawei technologies co ltd huawei accounted for 13  8  and 11  of our total revenue in fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively these customers purchase rf and wifi solutions for cellular base stations and a variety of mobile devices including smartphones wearables laptops tablets and cellularbased applications for the iot 

some of our sales to overseas customers are subject to export licenses or other restrictions imposed by the us department of commerce see risk factors in part i item 1a set forth in this report 

sales and marketing 

we sell our products worldwide directly to customers as well as through a network of us and foreign sales representative firms and distributors we select our domestic and foreign sales representatives based on technical skills and sales experience the presence of complementary product lines and the customer base served we provide ongoing training to our internal and external sales representatives and distributors to keep them educated about our products we maintain an internal sales and marketing organization that is responsible for key account management application engineering support for customers sales and advertising literature and technical presentations for industry conferences our sales and customer support centers are located near our customers throughout the world 

our website contains extensive product information and includes an online store where customers can learn about our newest products download product catalogs order product samples and request evaluation boards our global team of application engineers interacts with customers during all stages of design and production maintains regular contact with customer engineers provides product application notes and engineering data and assists in the resolution of technical problems we maintain close relationships with our customers and platform providers and provide them strong technical support to help anticipate future product needs and enhance their customer experience 

backlog and seasonality 

our sales are the result of standard purchase orders or specific agreements with customers we maintain qorvoowned finished goods inventory at certain customers’ hub locations and do not recognize revenue until our customers draw down the inventory at these hubs our customers’ projections of consumption of hub inventory and quantities on purchase orders as well as the shipment schedules are frequently revised within agreedupon lead times to reflect changes in the customers’ needs because industry practice allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment and with little or no penalty we believe that backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels 

historically we have experienced seasonal fluctuations in the sale of mobile products with revenue strongest in our second and third fiscal quarters and weakest in our fourth fiscal quarter 

competition 

we operate in a competitive industry characterized by rapid advances in technology and new product introductions our customers’ product life cycles are often short and our competitiveness depends on our ability to improve our products and processes faster than our competitors anticipate changing customer requirements and successfully develop and launch new products while reducing our costs our competitiveness is also affected by the quality of our customer service and technical support and our ability to design customized products that address each customer’s particular requirements within their cost limitations the selection process for our products to be included in our customers’ products is highly competitive and our customers provide no guarantees that our products will be included in the nextgeneration of products introduced 

mp competes primarily with the following companies broadcom limited murata manufacturing co ltd qualcomm technologies inc and skyworks solutions inc idp competes primarily with the following companies analog devices inc cree inc macom technology solutions inc skyworks solutions inc and sumitomo electric device innovations 

many of our current and potential competitors have entrenched market positions and customer relationships established patents and other intellectual property and substantial technological capabilities in some cases our competitors are also our customers or suppliers additionally many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing and marketing resources than we do which may allow them to implement new technologies and develop new products more quickly than we can 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets is important to our business and we actively seek opportunities to leverage our intellectual property portfolio to promote our business interests we also actively seek to monitor and protect our global intellectual property rights and to deter 

unauthorized use of our intellectual property and other assets such efforts can be difficult because of the absence of consistent international standards and laws moreover we respect the intellectual property rights of others and have implemented policies and procedures to mitigate the risk of infringing or misappropriating third party intellectual property 

patent applications are filed within the us and in other countries where we have a market presence on occasion some applications do not mature into patents for various reasons including rejections based on prior art in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws we have approximately 1400 patents that expire from 2019 to 2039 we also continue to acquire patents through acquisitions or direct prosecution efforts and engage in licensing transactions to secure the right to use third parties’ patents in view of our rapid innovation and product development and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes there is no guarantee that our products will not be obsolete before the related patents expire or are granted however we believe the duration and scope of our most relevant patents are sufficient to support our business which as a whole is not significantly dependent on any particular patent or other intellectual property right as we expand our products and offerings we also seek to expand our patent prosecution efforts to cover such products 

we periodically register federal trademarks service marks and trade names that distinguish our product brand names in the market we also monitor these marks for their proper and intended use additionally we rely on nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our interest in confidential and proprietary information that gives us a competitive advantage including business strategies unpatented inventions designs and process technology such information is closely monitored and made available only to those employees whose responsibilities require access to the information 

employees 

on march 30 2019  we had more than 8100 employees we believe that our future prospects will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain skilled employees competition for skilled personnel is intense and the number of persons with relevant experience particularly in rf engineering product design and technical marketing is limited none of our us employees are represented by a labor union some of our employees in germany and the netherlands are represented by internal works councils and some of our employees in china are represented by a labor union as of march 30 2019  approximately 10 of our global workforce was represented by a works council or labor union we have never experienced any work stoppage and we believe that our current employee relations are good 

  

environmental matters 

by virtue of operating our wafer fabrication facilities we are subject to a variety of extensive and changing domestic and international federal state and local governmental laws regulations and ordinances related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in the manufacturing process we pretreat and dispose of our wastewater for most of our manufacturing facilities and we contract for the disposal of our hazardous waste state agencies require us to report storage and emissions of environmentally hazardous materials and we have retained appropriate personnel to help ensure compliance with all applicable environmental regulations we believe that costs arising from existing environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

we are an iso 140012015 certified manufacturer with a comprehensive environmental management system ems in place to help ensure control of the environmental aspects of the manufacturing process our ems mandates compliance and establishes appropriate checks and balances to minimize the potential for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations 

we actively monitor the hazardous materials that are used in the manufacture assembly and test of our products particularly materials that are retained in the final product we have developed specific restrictions on the content of certain hazardous materials in our products as well as those of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers and subcontractors this helps to ensure that our products are compliant with the requirements of the markets into which the products will be sold and with our customers’ requirements for example our products are compliant with the european union rohs directive 201165eu on the restriction of use of hazardous substances which prohibits 

the sale in the european union market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing certain families of substances above a specified threshold 

historically the costs to comply with applicable environmental regulations have not been material and we currently do not expect the costs of complying with existing environmental regulations to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity capital resources or financial condition in fiscal 2020

 item 1a risk factors 

our operating results fluctuate 

our revenue earnings margins and other operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future if demand for our products fluctuates as a result of economic conditions or for other reasons our revenue and profitability could be impacted our future operating results will depend on many factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is likely that our future operating results could be adversely affected by one or more of the factors set forth above or other similar factors in addition any prolonged adverse effect on revenue could alter our anticipated working capital needs and interfere with our shortterm and longterm strategies if our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market analysts or our investors our stock price may decline 

our operating results are substantially dependent on development of new products and achieving design wins as our industry’s product life cycles are short and our customers requirements change rapidly 

our largest markets are characterized by short product life cycles and the frequent introduction of new products in response to evolving product requirements driven by end user demand for more functionality improved performance lower costs and smaller form factors our largest mp customers typically refresh some or all of their product portfolios by releasing new models each year in some cases product designs we pursue represent either opportunities to substantially increase our revenue by winning a new design or a risk of a substantial revenue loss by losing an incumbent product in a customers device 

our future success is dependent on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely and costeffective manner and secure production orders from our customers the development of new products is a highly complex process and we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products at times in the past our successful product development depends on a number of factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to design and introduce new products in a timely or costefficient manner and our new products may fail to meet market or customer requirements most major product design opportunities that we pursue involve multiple competitors and we could lose a new product design opportunity to a competitor that offers a lower cost or equal or superior performing product if we are unsuccessful in achieving design wins against our competitors our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected even when a design win is achieved our success is not assured design wins may require significant expenditures by us and typically precede volume revenue by six to nine months or more many customers seek a second source for all major components in their devices which can significantly reduce the revenue obtained from a design win in many cases the average selling prices of our products decline over the products’ lives and we must achieve yield improvements cost reductions and other productivity enhancements in order to maintain profitability the actual value of a design win to us will ultimately depend on the commercial success of our customers’ products 

we depend on a few large customers for a substantial portion of our revenue 

a substantial portion of our mp revenue comes from large purchases by a small number of customers our future operating results depend on both the success of our largest customers and on our success in diversifying our products and customer base collectively our two  largest end customers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 45  44  and 45  of our revenue for fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

the toptier cellular handset oems are releasing fewer new phone models on an annual basis which heightens the importance of achieving design wins for these larger opportunities while the financial rewards and market affirmation from a design win for these premier customers are greater competition for these projects is intense the concentration of our revenue with a relatively small number of customers makes us particularly dependent on factors both positive and negative affecting those customers if demand for their products increases our results are favorably impacted while if demand for their products decreases they may reduce their purchases of or stop purchasing our products and our operating results would suffer even if we achieve a design win our customers can delay or cancel the release of a new handset for any reason most of our customers can cease incorporating our products into their devices with little notice to us and with little or no penalty the loss of a large customer and failure to add new customers to replace lost revenue would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face risks of a loss of revenue if contracts with the united states government or defense and aerospace contractors are canceled or delayed or if defense spending is reduced 

we receive a portion of our revenue from the united states government and from prime contractors on united states governmentsponsored programs principally for defense and aerospace applications these programs are subject to delays or cancellation further spending on defense and aerospace programs can vary significantly depending on funding from the united states government we believe our government and defense and aerospace business has been negatively affected in the past by external factors such as sequestration and political pressure to reduce federal defense spending reductions in defense and aerospace funding or the loss of a significant defense and aerospace program or contract would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we depend heavily on third parties 

we purchase numerous component parts substrates and siliconbased products from external suppliers we also utilize thirdparty suppliers for numerous services including die processing wafer bumping test and tape and reel the use of external suppliers involves a number of risks including the possibility of material disruptions in the supply of key components and the lack of control over delivery schedules capacity constraints manufacturing yields product quality and fabrication costs 

although our key suppliers commit to us to be compliant with applicable iso 9001 andor ts16949 quality standards we have experienced quality and reliability issues in the past with certain suppliers quality or reliability issues in our supply chain could negatively affect our products our reputation and our results of operations 

we face risks related to sales through distributors   

we sell a significant portion of our products through third party distributors we depend on these distributors to help us create end customer demand provide technical support and other valueadded services to customers fill customer orders and stock our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products may be limited because our end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor due to advantages in the incumbent distributors’ technical support and favorable business terms related to payments discounts and stocking of acceptable inventory levels using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks including competitive pressure concentration credit risk and compliance risks other third parties may use one of our distributors to sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to the distributors to focus them on the sale of our products our distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by our distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

we face risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing facilities 

we operate wafer fabrication facilities in florida north carolina oregon and texas we currently use several international and domestic assembly suppliers as well as internal assembly facilities in china costa rica germany and the us to assemble and test our products we currently have our own test and tape and reel facilities located in china costa rica and the us and we also utilize contract suppliers and partners in asia to test our products 

a number of factors related to our facilities will affect our business and financial results including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs 

our worldwide operations and business could be disrupted by natural disasters industrial accidents cybersecurity incidents telecommunications failures power or water shortages extreme weather conditions public health issues military actions acts of terrorism political or regulatory issues and other manmade disasters or catastrophic events global climate change could result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity such as drought wildfires storms and flooding we carry commercial property damage and business interruption insurance against various risks with limits we deem adequate for reimbursement for damage to our fixed assets and resulting disruption of our operations however the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses any disruptions from these events could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations and could also have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results to the extent that losses are uninsured or exceed insurance recoveries and to the extent that such disruptions adversely impact our relationships with our customers furthermore even if our own operations are unaffected or recover quickly if our customers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a business disruption natural disaster or catastrophic event they may reduce or cancel their orders which may adversely affect our results of operations 

if we experience poor manufacturing yields our operating results may suffer 

our products have unique designs and are fabricated using multiple semiconductor process technologies that are highly complex in many cases our products are assembled in customized packages many of our products consist of multiple components in a single module and feature enhanced levels of integration and complexity our customers insist that our products be designed to meet their exact specifications for quality performance and reliability our manufacturing yield is a combination of yields across the entire supply chain including wafer fabrication assembly and test yields defects in a single component in an assembled module product can impact the yield for the entire module which means the adverse economic impacts of an individual defect can be multiplied many times over if we fail to discover the defect before the module is assembled due to the complexity of our products we periodically experience difficulties in achieving acceptable yields and other quality issues particularly with respect to new products 

our customers test our products once they have been assembled into their products the number of usable products that result from our production process can fluctuate as a result of many factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we constantly seek to improve our manufacturing yields typically for a given level of sales when our yields improve our gross margins improve and when our yields decrease our unit costs are higher our margins are lower and our operating results are adversely affected 

costs of product defects and deviations from required specifications could include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these costs could be significant and could reduce our gross margins our reputation with customers also could be damaged as a result of product defects and quality issues and product demand could be reduced which could harm our business and financial results 

we are subject to inventory risks and costs because we build our products based on forecasts provided by customers before receiving purchase orders for the products 

in order to ensure availability of our products for some of our largest end customers we start manufacturing certain products in advance of receiving purchase orders based on forecasts provided by these customers however these forecasts do not represent binding purchase commitments and we do not recognize sales for these products until they are shipped to or consumed by the customer as a result we incur significant inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales because demand for our products may not materialize or may be lower than expected manufacturing based on forecasts subjects us to heightened risks of higher inventory carrying costs increased obsolescence and higher operating costs these inventory risks are exacerbated when our customers purchase indirectly through contract manufacturers or hold component inventory levels greater than their consumption rate because this reduces our visibility regarding the customers’ accumulated levels of inventory if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to writeoff inventory which would have a negative impact on our gross margin and other operating results 

we sell certain of our products based on reference designs of platform providers and our inability to effectively manage or maintain our evolving relationships with these companies may have an adverse effect on our business 

platform providers are typically large companies that provide system reference designs for oems and odms that include the platform provider’s baseband and other complementary products a platform provider may own or control ip that gives it a strong market position for its baseband products for certain air interface standards which provides it with significant influence and control over sales of rf products for these standards platform providers historically looked to us and our competitors to provide rf products to their customers as part of the overall system design and we competed with other rf companies to have our products included in the platform provider’s system reference design this market dynamic has evolved in recent years as platform providers have worked to develop more fully integrated solutions that include their own rf technologies and components 

platform providers may be in a different business from ours or we may be their customer or direct competitor accordingly we must balance our interest in obtaining new business with competitive and other factors because platform providers control the overall system reference design if they offer competitive rf technologies or their own rf solutions as a part of their reference design and exclude our products from the design we are at a distinct competitive disadvantage with oems and odms that are seeking a turnkey design solution even if our products offer superior performance this requires us to work more closely with oems and odms to secure the design of our products in their handsets and other devices 

our relationships with platform providers are complex and evolving and the inability to effectively manage or maintain these relationships could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to risks from international sales and operations 

we operate globally with sales offices and rd activities as well as manufacturing assembly and test facilities in multiple countries and some of our business activities are concentrated in asia as a result we are subject to regulatory geopolitical and other risks associated with doing business outside the us including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sales to customers located outside the us accounted for approximately 84  of our revenue in fiscal 2019  of which approximately 57  and 18  were attributable to sales to customers located in china and taiwan respectively we expect that revenue from international sales to china and other markets will continue to be a significant part of our total revenue any weakness in the chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for consumer products that contain our products which could materially and adversely affect our business the imposition by the us of tariffs on goods imported from china countermeasures imposed by china in response us export restrictions on sales of products to china and other government actions that restrict or otherwise adversely affect our ability to sell our products to chinese customers could increase our manufacturing costs and reduce our product sales in china and other markets 

as a global company our results are affected by movements in currency exchange rates our exposure may increase or decrease over time as our foreign business levels fluctuate in the countries where we have operations and these changes could have a material impact on our financial results the functional currency for most of our international operations is the us dollar we have foreign operations in asia europe and costa rica and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the us our international revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars operating expenses and certain working capital items related to our foreignbased operations are in some instances denominated in the local foreign currencies and therefore are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies such as the costa rican colon euro pound sterling renminbi and singapore dollar if the us dollar weakens compared to these and other currencies our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when remeasured back into us dollars 

economic regulation in china could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we have a significant portion of our assembly and testing capacity in china for many years the chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid growth and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation in response to these factors the chinese government has from time to time adopted measures to regulate growth and to contain inflation including currency controls and measures designed to restrict credit control prices or set currency exchange rates such actions in the future as well as other changes in chinese laws and regulations including actions in furtherance of china’s stated policy of reducing its dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers could increase the cost of doing business in china foster the emergence of chinesebased competitors decrease the demand for our products in china or reduce the supply of critical materials for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

changes in government trade policies including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions could limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the us or foreign governments may take administrative legislative or regulatory action that could materially interfere with our ability to sell products in certain countries particularly in china for example between july 2018 and may 2019 the office of the united states trade representative imposed 25 tariffs on specified product lists including certain electronic components and equipment totaling approximately 250 billion in chinese imports in response china imposed or proposed new or higher tariffs on us products the us government has also threatened to impose tariffs on an additional 325 billion of chinese imports and china has threatened additional retaliatory actions while the imposition of these tariffs did not have a direct material adverse impact on our business during fiscal year 2019 the direct and indirect effects of tariffs and other restrictive trade policies are difficult to measure and are only one part of a larger uschina economic and trade policy disagreement for example imposition of tariffs on our customers’ products that are imported from china to the us could harm sales 

of such products which would harm our business we cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the us and china or other countries what products may be subject to such actions or what actions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation 

furthermore we have experienced restrictions on our ability to sell products to certain foreign customers where sales of products require export licenses or are prohibited by government action the us government has in the past issued export restrictions that effectively banned american companies from selling products to zte one of our customers and in may 2019 imposed a similar ban on sales of all products to huawei which accounted for 13  of our total revenue during fiscal 2019 as of the date of this report we are unable to predict the scope and duration of the export restrictions imposed on huawei and the corresponding future effects on our business even if such restrictions are lifted any financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed on huawei could have a continuing negative impact on our future revenue and results of operations in addition huawei or other foreign customers affected by future us government sanctions or threats of sanctions may respond by developing their own solutions to replace our products or by adopting our foreign competitors’ solutions 

moreover us government actions targeting exports of certain technologies to china are becoming more pervasive for example in 2018 the us adopted new laws designed to address concerns about the export of emerging and foundational technologies to china in addition in may 2019 president trump issued an executive order that invoked national emergency economic powers to implement a framework to regulate the acquisition or transfer of information communications technology in transactions that imposed undue national security risks these actions could lead to additional restrictions on the export of products that include or enable certain technologies including products we provide to chinabased customers 

the loss or temporary loss of huawei or other foreign customers or the imposition of restrictions on our ability to sell products to such customers as a result of tariffs export restrictions or other us regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our sales business and results of operations 

we operate in a very competitive industry and must continue to implement innovative technologies 

we compete with several companies primarily engaged in the business of designing manufacturing and selling rf solutions as well as suppliers of discrete integrated circuits and modules in addition to our direct competitors some of our largest end customers and leading platform partners also compete with us to some extent by designing and manufacturing their own products increased competition from any source could adversely affect our operating results through lower prices for our products reduced demand for our products losses of existing design slots with key customers and a corresponding reduction in our ability to recover development engineering and manufacturing costs 

many of our existing and potential competitors have entrenched market positions historical affiliations with oems considerable internal manufacturing capacity established ip rights and substantial technological capabilities the semiconductor industry has experienced increased industry consolidation over the last several years a trend we expect to continue many of our existing and potential competitors may have greater financial technical manufacturing or marketing resources than we do we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully with our competitors 

industry overcapacity could cause us to underutilize our manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

it is difficult to predict future demand for our products which makes it difficult to estimate future requirements for production capacity and avoid periods of overcapacity fluctuations in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products also can lead to overcapacity and contribute to cyclicality in the semiconductor market 

capacity expansion projects have long lead times and require capital commitments based on forecasted product trends and demand well in advance of production orders from customers in recent years we have made significant capital investments to expand our premium filter capacity to address forecasted future demand patterns in certain cases these capacity additions exceeded the nearterm demand requirements leading to overcapacity situations and underutilization of our manufacturing facilities 

as many of our manufacturing costs are fixed these costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues experienced during periods of underutilization underutilization of our manufacturing facilities can adversely affect our gross margin and other operating results if demand for our products experiences a prolonged decrease we may be required to close or idle facilities and write down our longlived assets or shorten the useful lives of underutilized assets and accelerate depreciation which would increase our expenses for example to address manufacturing overcapacity in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we commenced a phased closure of a saw filter manufacturing facility in florida and a transfer of production to our north carolina facility which we expect will be completed by the end of fiscal 2020 also in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we announced the temporary idling of a baw manufacturing facility in texas these actions resulted in impairment charges accelerated depreciation and other restructuringrelated costs and expenses 

we may not be able to borrow funds under our credit facility or secure future financing 

on december 5 2017 we entered into a fiveyear unsecured senior credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement with bank of america na as administrative agent swing line lender and lc issuer and a syndicate of lenders as amended the credit agreement the credit agreement includes a 3000 million  revolving credit facility which is available for working capital capital expenditures and other corporate purposes this facility contains various conditions covenants and representations with which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds we cannot assure that we will be in compliance with these conditions covenants and representations in the future when we may need to borrow funds under this facility 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt including our notes or to fund capital expenditures and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our debt obligations and financing requirements which may not be successful or on terms favorable to us 

the credit agreement also includes a 4000 million senior delayed draw term loan the term loan of which 1000 million was funded at closing and then subsequently repaid during march 2018 at our discretion we may draw down the remaining balance in up to two advances prior to june 30 2019 additionally we may request that the term loan or the revolving credit facility be increased by an amount not to exceed 3000 million 

in november 2015 we issued 4500 million  aggregate principal amount of 675  senior notes due 2023 the 2023 notes and 5500 million  aggregate principal amount of 700  senior notes due 2025 the 2025 notes pursuant to an indenture dated as of november 19 2015 the 2015 indenture during fiscal 2019 we completed the repurchase of all of the 2023 notes and all but 234 million  of the 2025 notes additionally in fiscal 2019 we issued 9000 million  aggregate principal amount of 550  senior notes due 2026 the 2026 notes and together with the 2025 notes the “notes” pursuant to an indenture dated as of july 16 2018 as supplemented the “2018 indenture” and together with the 2015 indenture the “indentures” 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations including the term loan and the notes and to fund working capital planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts and any strategic alliances or acquisitions we may make in the future depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we cannot be sure that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay our debt including the term loan and the notes if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may face liquidity issues and be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service and other obligations additionally the credit agreement and the indentures limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition as a result we may not be allowed under these documents to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy our debt service obligations further we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity and we cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the agreements and instruments governing our debt impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility 

the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the term loan and the indentures governing the notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these covenants could have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete in addition the credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants operating results below current levels or other adverse factors including a significant increase in interest rates could result in our being unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in our revolving credit facility if we violate covenants under the credit agreement and are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders our debt under our revolving credit facility would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders because of crossdefault provisions in the agreements and instruments governing our debt a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under and the acceleration of our other debt if our debt is accelerated we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if we are able to obtain new financing it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us if our debt is in default for any reason our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions 

the price of our common stock has recently been and may in the future be volatile 

the price of our common stock which is traded on the nasdaq global select market has been and may continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in addition the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

we cannot assure that the price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future in addition the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to our performance 

damage to our reputation or brand could negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with customers employees governments suppliers and other stakeholders if we fail to address issues that give rise to reputational risk including those described throughout this “risk factors” section we could significantly harm our reputation and our brand our reputation may also be damaged by how we respond to corporate crises corporate crises can arise from catastrophic events as well as from incidents involving product quality security or safety issues allegations of unethical behavior or misconduct or legal noncompliance internal control failures corporate governance issues data or privacy breaches workplace safety incidents environmental incidents the use of our products for illegal or objectionable applications media statements the conduct of our suppliers or representatives and other issues or incidents that whether actual or perceived result in adverse publicity if we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address such crises the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brands and could lead to litigation or subject us to regulatory actions or restrictions damage to our reputation could harm customer relations reduce demand for our products reduce investor confidence in us adversely affect our stock price and may also limit our ability to be seen as an employer of choice when competing for highly skilled employees moreover repairing our reputation and brands may be difficult timeconsuming and expensive 

we may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases 

we are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program and the amount and timing of our stock repurchases may fluctuate based on a number of factors including our priorities for the use of our cash for other purposes such as capital spending and acquisitions restrictions under securities laws and the agreements and instruments governing our debt and because of changes in our cash flows tax laws and the market price of our common stock 

our acquisitions and other strategic investments including our recent acquisition of activesemi could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives disrupt our ongoing business and adversely impact our results of operations 

as part of our business strategy and as demonstrated in our recent acquisition of activesemi we expect to continue to review potential acquisitions and strategic investments that could complement our current product offerings augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth or margin improvement opportunities in the event of future acquisitions of businesses products or technologies we could issue equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership incur substantial debt or other financial obligations or assume contingent liabilities such actions could harm our results of operations or the price of our common stock acquisitions and strategic investments also entail numerous other risks that could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition including 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moreover our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs accordingly if we pursue a particular transaction we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows particularly in the case of a large acquisition 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate key employees and our failure to do so could harm our business and our results of operations 

in order to compete effectively we must 

 

 

 

 

our future operating results and success depend on keeping key technical personnel and management and expanding our sales and marketing rd and administrative support we do not have employment agreements with the vast majority of our employees we must also continue to attract qualified personnel the competition for qualified personnel is intense and the number of people with experience particularly in rf engineering integrated circuit and filter design and technical marketing and support is limited in addition existing or new immigration laws policies or regulations in the us may limit the pool of available talent travel bans difficulties obtaining visas and other restrictions on international travel could make it more difficult to effectively manage our international operations operate as a global company or service our international customer base changes in the interpretation and application of employmentrelated laws to our workforce practices may also result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain skilled personnel in the future which could harm our business and our results of operations 

we rely on our intellectual property portfolio and may not be able to successfully protect against the use of our intellectual property by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of 

our pending applications or that patents will be issued in all countries where our products can be sold further we cannot be certain that any claims allowed from pending applications will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection against our competitors our competitors may also be able to design around our patents 

the laws of some countries in which our products are developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws this increases the possibility of misappropriation or infringement of our technology and products although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology additionally our competitors may be able to independently develop noninfringing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours 

we may need to engage in legal actions to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights generally intellectual property litigation is both expensive and unpredictable our involvement in intellectual property litigation could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights 

our operating results may be adversely affected if third parties were to assert claims that our products infringed their patent copyright or other intellectual property rights such assertions could lead to expensive and unpredictable litigation diverting the attention of management and technical personnel an unsuccessful result in any such litigation could have adverse effects on our business which may include injunctions exclusion orders and royalty payments to third parties in addition if one of our customers or another supplier to one of our customers were found to be infringing on thirdparty intellectual property rights such finding could adversely affect the demand for our products 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our proprietary information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

we rely on trade secrets technical knowhow and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities to provide us with competitive advantages we protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants strategic partners and other third parties we also design our computer networks and implement various procedures to restrict unauthorized access to dissemination of our proprietary information 

we face internal and external data security threats current departing or former employees or third parties could attempt to improperly use or access our computer systems and networks to copy obtain or misappropriate our proprietary information or otherwise interrupt our business like others we are also subject to significant system or network disruptions from numerous causes including computer viruses and other cyberattacks facility access issues new system implementations and energy blackouts 

security breaches computer malware phishing spoofing and other cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years while we defend against these threats on a daily basis we do not believe that such attacks to date have caused us any material damage because the techniques used by computer hackers and others to access or sabotage networks constantly evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate counter or ameliorate all of these techniques as a result our and our customers proprietary information may be misappropriated and the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted any loss of such information could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence in the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the incident and divert management and other resources we routinely implement improvements to our network security safeguards and we are devoting increasing resources to the security of our information technology systems we cannot however assure that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future cyberattack or network disruptions 

the costs related to cyberattacks or other security threats or computer systems disruptions typically would not be fully insured or indemnified by others occurrence of any of the events described above could result in loss of competitive advantages derived from our rd efforts or our ip moreover these events may result in the early obsolescence of our products product development delays or diversion of the attention of management and key 

information technology and other resources or otherwise adversely affect our internal operations and reputation or degrade our financial results and stock price 

we may be subject to theft loss or misuse of personal data by or about our employees customers or other third parties which could increase our expenses damage our reputation or result in legal or regulatory proceedings 

in the ordinary course of our business we have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information regarding our employees and others that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business or by our third party service providers including business process software applications providers and other vendors that have access to sensitive data could result in damage to our reputation disruption of our business activities significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims 

global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment for example the european union has adopted the general data protection regulation gdpr which requires companies to comply with rules regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices complying with these changing laws has caused and could continue to cause us to incur substantial costs which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations further failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity finally even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in audits regulatory inquiries or proceedings against us by governmental entities or others 

we are subject to warranty claims product recalls and product liability 

from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expense we may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters and our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims 

product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and such insurance may be unavailable or inadequate to protect against all claims if one of our customers recalls a product containing one of our devices we may incur significant costs and expenses including replacement costs direct and indirect product recallrelated costs diversion of technical and other resources and reputational harm our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions relating to product quality issues the potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant and in some cases including in agreements with some of our largest end customers are potentially unlimited any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from sale of the relevant products costs payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to risks associated with environmental health and safety regulations and climate change 

we are subject to a broad array of us and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations include those related to the use transportation storage handling emission discharge and recycling or disposal of hazardous materials used in our manufacturing assembly and testing processes our failure to comply with any of these existing or future laws or regulations could result in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existing and future environmental laws and regulations could also impact our product designs and limit or restrict the materials or components that are included in our products in addition many of our largest end customers require us to comply with corporate social responsibility policies which often include employment health safety environmental and other requirements that exceed applicable legal requirements compliance with these policies increases our operating expenses and noncompliance can adversely affect customer relationships and harm our business 

new climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or procure substitute raw materials that may cost more or be more difficult to procure in addition new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in increased costs for us and our suppliers various jurisdictions are developing other climate changebased regulations that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results we expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future future compliance with these laws and regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

compliance with regulations regarding the use of “conflict minerals” could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

regulations in the us currently require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products referred to as conflict minerals originated in the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries or were from recycled or scrap sources we may face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently make any required determination that the metals used in our products are conflict free 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying deterring preventing or rendering more difficult a change in control of qorvo that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests these provisions include 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the general corporation law of the state of delaware contains provisions that regulate “business combinations” between corporations and interested stockholders who own 15 or more of the corporation’s voting stock except under certain circumstances these provisions could also discourage potential acquisition proposals and delay or prevent a change in control 

these provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit of any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context and may also make it more difficult for a third party to 

replace directors on our board of directors further the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 

our operating results could vary as a result of the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see critical accounting policies and estimates  in part ii item 7 of this report such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments that could significantly affect our results of operations 

decisions we make about the scope of our future operations could affect our future financial results 

from time to time changes in the business environment have led us to change the scope of our operations or business which has resulted in restructuring and asset impairment charges and this could occur in the future the amount and timing of such charges can be difficult to predict factors that contribute to the amount and timing of such charges include 

 

 

 

 

changes in our effective tax rate may adversely impact our results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in china germany singapore the us and numerous other foreign taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuations as it is impacted by a number of factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

changes in the favorable tax status of our subsidiaries in singapore and costa rica would have an adverse impact on our operating results 

our subsidiaries in singapore and costa rica have been granted tax holidays that effectively minimize our tax expense and that are expected to be effective through december 2021 and march 2024 respectively in their efforts to deal with budget deficits governments around the world are focusing on increasing tax revenues through increased audits and potentially increased tax rates for corporations as part of this effort governments continue to review their policies on granting tax holidays in february 2017 singapore enacted legislation that will exclude from our existing development and expansion incentive grant the benefit of the reduced tax rate for intellectual property income earned after june 30 2021 future changes in the status of either tax holiday could have a negative effect on our net income in future years 

the enactment of international or domestic tax legislation or changes in regulatory guidance may adversely impact our results of operations 

corporate tax reform baseerosion efforts and increased tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions in which we have business operations in 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which included a number of changes to us tax laws that impacted us including the onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the “transitional repatriation tax” and the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” provisions in addition other countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and action plan which aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder tax transfer pricing documentations rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices legislative changes interpretations and guidance and changes in prior tax rulings and decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes resulting from these initiatives could increase our effective tax rate and result in taxes we previously paid being subject to change which may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations

operating expenses   

research and development

income tax benefit expense 

income tax benefit  for fiscal 2019  was 413 million  this was primarily comprised of tax benefits related to domestic and international operations generating pretax book losses tax credits adjustments related to provisional estimates for the impact of the tax act and a decrease in gross unrecognized tax benefits offset by tax expenses related to international operations generating pretax book income and 708 million  related to the gilti inclusions for fiscal 2019 this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 450  

income tax expense for fiscal 2018  was 574 million  this was primarily comprised of tax expense related to the net 773 million  provisional impact of the tax act international operations generating pretax book income and an increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits offset by tax benefits related to tax credits and domestic and international operations generating pretax book losses for fiscal 2018  this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 3350  

a valuation allowance has been established against deferred tax assets in the taxing jurisdictions where based upon the positive and negative evidence available it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized realization is dependent upon generating future income in the taxing jurisdictions in which the operating loss carryovers credit carryovers depreciable tax basis and other deferred tax assets exist management reevaluates the ability to realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis as of the end of fiscal years 2019  and 2018  the valuation allowance against domestic and foreign deferred tax assets was 404 million  and 428 million  respectively 

see note 12  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding income taxes 

stockbased compensation 

under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc 718 “compensation – stock compensation”  stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award using an option pricing model for stock options blackscholes and market price for restricted stock units and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period 

as of march 30 2019  total remaining unearned compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units and options was 740 million  which will be amortized over the weightedaverage remaining service period of approximately 12 years  

liquidity and capital resources 

cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity as of march 30 2019  we had working capital of approximately 12492 million  including 7110 million  in cash and cash equivalents compared to working capital of 14025 million  including 9260 million  in cash and cash equivalents as of march 31 2018  

our 7110 million  of total cash and cash equivalents as of march 30 2019  includes approximately 4768 million  held by our foreign subsidiaries of which 3451 million  is held by qorvo international pte ltd in singapore if the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are needed in the us we may be required to accrue and pay state income andor foreign local withholding taxes to repatriate these earnings under our current plans we may repatriate the foreign earnings of qorvo international pte ltd and expect to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our other foreign subsidiaries 

credit agreement 

on december 5 2017 we and certain of our material domestic subsidiaries the “guarantors” entered into a fiveyear unsecured senior credit facility with bank of america na as administrative agent swing line lender and lc issuer and a syndicate of lenders as amended the “credit agreement” on the same date in connection with the execution of the credit agreement we terminated our prior credit agreement dated april 7 2015 

the credit agreement includes a senior delayed draw term loan of up to 4000 million  the term loan and a 3000 million  revolving line of credit the revolving facility together with the term loan the credit facility in december 2017 1000 million  of the term loan was funded and this amount was subsequently repaid in march 2018 the remainder of the term loan is available at our discretion in up to two draws prior to june 30 2019  the revolving facility includes a 250 million  sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a 100 million  sublimit for swing line loans we may request at any time that the credit facility be increased by an amount not to exceed 3000 million  the credit facility is available to finance working capital capital expenditures and other corporate purposes our obligations under the credit agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed by the guarantors outstanding amounts are due in full on the maturity date of december 5 2022  with amounts borrowed under the swing line option due in full no later than ten business days after such loan is made we had no outstanding amounts under the credit facility as of march 30 2019  

see note 8  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report for further information about the credit agreement including applicable interest rates and financial covenants as of march 30 2019 we were in compliance with all the financial covenants under the credit agreement 

stock repurchases   

on may 23 2018 we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to 10 billion  of our outstanding stock which included approximately 1263 million  authorized under a prior share repurchase program which was terminated concurrent with the new authorization under this program share repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the extent to which we repurchase our shares the number of shares and the timing of any repurchases will depend on general market conditions regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other considerations the program does not require us to repurchase a minimum number of shares does not have a fixed term and may be modified suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice 

we repurchased 91 million  shares and 29 million  shares of our common stock during fiscal years 2019  and 2018  respectively at an aggregate cost of 6381 million  and 2199 million  respectively in accordance with our share repurchase program described above and its predecessor share repurchase program as of march 30 2019  3979 million  remains available for future repurchases under our current share repurchase program 

cash flows from operating activities   

operating activities in fiscal 2019  provided cash of 8104 million  compared to 8525 million  in fiscal 2018  this yearoveryear decrease was primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital and increased tax payments offset by increased net income in fiscal 2019  

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2019  was 2476 million  compared to 2774 million  in fiscal 2018  we are controlling capital expenditures through the reuse of tools and reconfiguration of our factories 

  

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2019  was 7767 million  compared to 1968 million  in fiscal 2018  this yearoveryear increase was primarily due to higher share repurchase activity the repurchase and redemption of the 2023 notes and the repurchase of a majority of the 2025 notes partially offset by the issuance of the 2026 notes 

our future capital requirements may differ materially from those currently anticipated and will depend on many factors including market acceptance of and demand for our products acquisition opportunities technological advances and our relationships with suppliers and customers based on current and projected levels of cash flow from operations coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents and our credit facility we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet both our shortterm and longterm cash requirements however if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products or if our revenue grows faster than we anticipate operating cash flows may be insufficient to meet our needs if existing resources and cash from operations are not sufficient to meet our future requirements or if we perceive conditions to be favorable we may seek additional debt or equity financing additional equity or debt financing could be dilutive to holders of our common stock further we cannot be sure that additional equity or debt financing if required will be available on favorable terms if at all 

impact of inflation 

we do not believe that the effects of inflation had a significant impact on our revenue or operating income during fiscal years 2019  and 2018  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of march 30 2019  we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

as discussed in note 9  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report we have two pension plans in germany with a combined benefit obligation of approximately 129 million  as of march 30 2019  pension benefit payments are not included in the schedule above because they are not available for all periods presented pension benefit payments were approximately 02 million  in fiscal 2019  and are expected to be approximately 03 million  in fiscal 2020  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to use judgment and estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management our critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies however these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report 

inventory reserves the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons generally 12 to 24 months the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory reserves are the same as those used in our revenue forecasts and are also consistent with the estimates used in our manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base market conditions and customer acceptance of our products and technologies as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost 

historically inventory reserves have fluctuated as new technologies have been introduced and customers’ demand has shifted inventory reserves had an impact on margins of less than 2  in fiscal years 2019  and 2018  

property and equipment periodically we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property and equipment considering factors such as changes in machinery and equipment technology our ability to reuse equipment across generations of process technology and historical usage trends when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the revised useful lives of the assets 

we assess property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset group may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include an adverse change in our use of the assets or an expectation that the assets will be sold or otherwise disposed we assess the recoverability of the assets held and used by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts assets identified as “held for sale” are recorded at the lesser of their carrying value or their fair market value less costs to sell impairment if any is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets the process of evaluating property and equipment for impairment is highly subjective and requires significant judgment as we are required to make assumptions about items such as future demand for our products and industry trends 

goodwill and intangible assets   goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for a business exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired intangibles are recorded when such assets are acquired by purchase or license the value of our intangibles including goodwill could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results ii a decline in the value of technology company stocks including the value of our common stock iii a prolonged or more significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the semiconductor industry or iv failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results    

we account for goodwill in accordance with the fasbs guidance which requires annual testing for impairment or whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred   we perform our annual impairment tests on the first day of the fourth quarter in each fiscal year our indefinitelived intangible assets consist of inprocess research and development 

we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment commonly referred to as step zero to determine whether further quantitative analysis for impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets is 

necessary in performing step zero for our impairment test we are required to make assumptions and judgments including the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to our business industry and market trends and the overall future financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate we also consider recent fair value calculations of our indefinitelived intangible assets and reporting units as well as cost factors such as changes in raw materials labor or other costs if the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinitelived asset is less than its respective carrying value including goodwill then we would perform an additional quantitative analysis for goodwill this involves a twostep process the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit including its goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then the second step of the process is performed to determine the amount of impairment the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recognized for the amount the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 

for indefinitelived intangible assets the quantitative analysis compares the carrying value of the asset to its fair value and an impairment charge is recognized for the amount its carrying value exceeds its fair value 

determining the fair value of reporting units indefinitelived intangible assets and implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill is reliant upon estimated future revenues profitability and cash flows and consideration of market factors assumptions judgments and estimates are complex subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts although we believe the assumptions judgments and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate different assumptions judgments and estimates could materially affect our results of operations 

goodwill 

goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the expected benefit from the synergies of the business combinations generating the underlying goodwill   in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 we completed qualitative assessments to determine whether conditions existed that indicated it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units was less than the carrying value if we concluded based on assessment of relevant events facts and circumstances that it was more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value was greater than its carrying value no further impairment testing was required we concluded that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 and no further testing was required 

if our assessment of qualitative factors indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than the carrying value then a quantitative assessment is performed we also have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment described above and proceed directly to the quantitative assessment the quantitative assessment requires comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying value including goodwill 

we use both the income and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units the income approach involves discounting future estimated cash flows the sum of the reporting unit cash flow projections is compared to our market capitalization in a discounted cash flow framework to calculate our overall implied internal rate of return or discount rate our market capitalization is adjusted to a control basis assuming a reasonable control premium which results in an implied discount rate this implied discount rate serves as a baseline for estimating the specific discount rate for each reporting unit 

the discount rate used is the valueweighted average of our estimated cost of equity and debt “cost of capital” derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics our weighted average cost of capital is adjusted for each reporting unit to reflect a risk factor if necessary for each reporting unit we perform sensitivity tests with respect to growth rates and discount rates used in the income approach we also consider historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates used in our analysis we believe the income approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the respective reporting unit’s expected longterm operations and cash flow performance 

in applying the market approach valuation multiples are derived from historical and projected operating data of selected guideline companies which are evaluated and adjusted if necessary based on the strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit relative to the selected guideline companies the valuation multiples are then applied to the appropriate historical andor projected operating data of the reporting unit to arrive at an indication of fair value we believe the market approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value using multiples from companies with operations and economic characteristics similar to our reporting units we weight the results of the income approach and the results of the market approach at 50 each for the mp and idp reporting units and if it is concluded that the fair value of the reporting units is determined to be substantially in excess of the carrying value no further analysis is warranted if the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount in excess not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

intangible assets  with definite lives 

intangible assets are recorded when such assets are acquired by purchase or license    finitelived intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology and customer relationships resulting from business combinations and are subject to amortization 

the fair value of developed technology acquired during fiscal years 2013 2015 and 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the excess earnings method which estimated the value of the intangible assets by discounting the future projected earnings of the asset to present value as of the valuation date developed technology is amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life ranging from three  to six  years 

the fair value of customer relationships acquired during fiscal years 2015 and 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the “with and without method in which the value of the asset was determined by the difference in discounted cash flows of our profitability with the asset and our profitability without the asset customer relationships are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life ranging from three  to ten  years 

we regularly review identified intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life has changed from the original estimate or that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable if such facts and circumstances exist we assess the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts impairments if any are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the impairment determination was made 

revenue recognition  we generate revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products either directly to a customer or to a distributor or at completion of a consignment process revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services a majority of our revenue is recognized at a point in time either on shipment or delivery of the product depending on individual customer terms and conditions revenue from sales to our distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors sellin revenue is recognized from our consignment programs at a point in time when the products are pulled from consignment inventory by the customer revenue recognized for products and services overtime is immaterial less than 2  of overall revenue we apply a fivestep approach as defined in asc 606  revenue from contracts with customers in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized 1 identifying the contract with a customer 2 identifying the performance obligations in the contract 3 determining the transaction price 4 allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognizing revenue when the corresponding performance obligation is satisfied 

sales agreements are in place with certain customers and contain terms and conditions with respect to payment delivery warranty and supply but typically do not require minimum purchase commitments in the absence of a sales agreement our standard terms and conditions apply we consider a customers purchase order which is governed by a sales agreement or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer 

our pricing terms are negotiated independently on a standalone basis in determining the transaction price we evaluate whether the price is subject to a refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled variable consideration in the form of rebate programs is offered to certain customers including distributors a majority of these rebates are accrued and classified as a contra accounts receivable and represent less than 5  of net revenue we determine variable consideration by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer our terms and conditions do not give our customers a right of return associated with the original sale of our products however we may authorize sales returns under certain circumstances which include courtesy returns and likekind exchanges sales returns are classified as a refund liability we reduce revenue and record reserves for product returns and allowances rebate programs and scrap allowance based on historical experience or specific identification depending on the contractual terms of the arrangement 

our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from our customers payments are due upon completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing substantially all payments are collected within our standard terms which do not include any financing components to date there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable contract assets and contract liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet were immaterial as of march 30 2019 

we invoice customers upon shipment and recognize revenues in accordance with delivery terms as of march 30 2019  we had 320 million  in remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year of which the majority is expected to be recognized as income over the next twelve months 

we include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and include the related shipping costs in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations taxes assessed by government authorities on revenueproducing transactions including tariffs valueadded and excise taxes are excluded from revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 

we incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers sales commissions which are recorded in the selling general and administrative expense line item in the consolidated statements of operations are expensed when incurred because such commissions are not owed until the performance obligation is satisfied which coincides with the end of the contract term and therefore no remaining period exists over which to amortize the commissions 

income taxes    in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense the resultant tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

as part of our financial process we assess on a tax jurisdictional basis the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not more likely than not a likelihood of less than 50 percent the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to ultimately be recoverable in this process certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the amount of income or loss in prior years the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies changes in taxable income market conditions us or international tax laws and other factors may change our judgment regarding whether we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets these changes if any may require material adjustments to the net deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding changes in the valuation allowance and net deferred tax assets 

as part of our financial process we also assess the likelihood that our tax reporting positions will ultimately be sustained to the extent it is determined it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of a tax reporting position will ultimately not be recognized and 

sustained a provision for unrecognized tax benefit is provided by either reducing the applicable deferred tax asset or accruing an income tax liability our judgment regarding the sustainability of our tax reporting positions may change in the future due to changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to the related deferred tax assets or accrued income tax liabilities and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions and the amount of unrecognized tax benefits

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to seek a reduction in the potential negative earnings effects from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity price risk and commodity prices arising from our business activities we manage these financial exposures through operational means and by using various financial instruments when deemed appropriate these practices may change as economic conditions change 

interest rates   

the interest rates under our credit agreement are variable however since we have no outstanding balances under the credit agreement there is no interest rate risk related to this facility as of march 30 2019  

currency exchange rates 

as a global company our results are affected by movements in currency exchange rates our exposure may increase or decrease over time as our foreign business levels fluctuate in the countries where we have operations and these changes could have a material impact on our financial results the functional currency for most of our international operations is the us dollar we have foreign operations in asia costa rica and europe and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the us our international revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars operating expenses and certain working capital items related to our foreignbased operations are in some instances denominated in the local foreign currencies and therefore are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies such as the costa rican colon euro pound sterling renminbi and singapore dollar if the us dollar weakens compared to these and other currencies our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when remeasured back into us dollars we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means 

for fiscal 2019  we incurred a foreign currency loss of 21 million  as compared to a loss of 28 million  in fiscal 2018  which is recorded in “other expense” 

  

our financial instrument holdings including foreign receivables cash and payables at march 30 2019  were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes in this sensitivity analysis we assumed that the change in one currencys rate relative to the us dollar would not have an effect on other currencies rates relative to the us dollar all other factors were held constant if the us dollar declined in value 10 in relation to the remeasured foreign currency instruments our net income would have decreased  by approximately 14 million  if the us dollar increased in value 10 in relation to the remeasured foreign currency instruments our net income would have increased  by approximately 11 million  

equity price risk 

our marketable equity investments in publicly traded companies are subject to market price risk accordingly a fluctuation in the price of each equity security could have an adverse impact on the fair value of our investment as of march 30 2019 our equity investments were immaterial see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report 

commodity prices 

we routinely use precious metals in the manufacture of our products supplies for such commodities may from time to time become restricted or general market factors and conditions may affect the pricing of such commodities we also have an active reclamation process to capture any unused gold while we attempt to mitigate the risk of increases in commoditiesrelated costs there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully safeguard against potential shortterm and longterm commodity price fluctuations

manufacturing 

the majority of our products are multichip modules utilizing multiple semiconductor and acoustic material processing technologies these products have varying degrees of complexity and contain semiconductors and other components that are manufactured inhouse or outsourced we are a leading supplier of rf solutions and a leading manufacturer of gaas hbt gaas phemt gan saw tcsaw and baw products 

we operate wafer fabrication facilities for the production of gaas gan saw tcsaw and baw wafers in apopka florida greensboro north carolina hillsboro oregon and richardson texas we also use multiple siliconbased process technologies including soi sige and cmos we outsource all silicon manufacturing to leading silicon foundries located throughout the world we have a global supply chain and ship millions of units per day 

we have our own flip chip and waferlevel packaging wlp technologies and we also use external suppliers for these and other packaging technologies in flip chip packages the electrical connections are created directly on the surface of the die which eliminates wirebonds so the die may be attached directly to a substrate or leadframe this type of technology provides a higher density interconnection than wirebonded die and enables smaller form factors with improved thermal and electrical performance we use wlp technologies for our saw tcsaw and baw filter products 

once semiconductor wafers are manufactured they are singulated or separated into individual units called die prior to singulation of wafers into die we regularly conduct wafer level tests which could include electrical validation rf testing through the designed frequency bands as well as visual inspection for module products the next step is assembly during assembly the die and other components are placed on highdensity interconnect substrates to provide connectivity between the die and the components this populated substrate is formed into a microelectronic package next the products are tested for rf performance and prepared for shipment through a tape and reel process we primarily use internal assembly facilities in china costa rica germany and the us and we also utilize external suppliers we also manufacture large volumes of wlp die and discrete filters that our customers directly assemble into their products 

manufacturing yields can vary significantly between products based on a number of factors including product complexity and the maturity of our manufacturing processes to maximize wafer yields and quality we test products multiple times maintain continuous reliability monitoring and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the production flow 

our internal manufacturing facilities require a high level of fixed costs consisting primarily of occupancy costs maintenance repair equipment depreciation and fixed labor costs related to manufacturing and process engineering 

ics and filter products are highly complex and sensitive to contaminants and semiconductor fabrication requires highly controlled clean environments wafers can be rejected or die on a wafer can be found to be nonfunctional as a result of minute impurities variances in the fabrication process or defects in the masks used to transfer circuits onto the wafers 

our manufacturing facilities worldwide are certified to the iso 9001 quality standard and select locations are certified to additional automotive iatf 16949 aerospace as 9100 and environmental iso 14001 standards 

these stringent standards are audited and certified by thirdparty auditors in addition to our continuous internal selfaudits the iso 9001 standard is based on a number of quality management principles including a strong customer focus the motivation of top management the process approach and continual improvement iatf 16949 is the highest international quality standard for the global automotive industry and incorporates specific additional requirements for the automotive industry as 9100 is the standardized quality management system for the aerospace industry iso 14001 is an internationally agreed upon standard for an environmental management system we require that all of our key vendors and suppliers be compliant with select standards as applicable 

raw materials 

we purchase numerous raw materials passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing processes for our gaas and gan manufacturing operations we use several raw materials including gaas wafers and gan on sic wafers for our acoustic filter manufacturing operations we use several raw materials including wafer starting materials made from quartz silicon lithium niobate or lithium tantalite as well as ceramic or metal packages relatively few companies produce these materials our most significant suppliers of ceramic surface mount packages are based in japan 

for our siliconbased products we use thirdparty foundries high demand for silicon wafers and wafer starting materials has led to supply constraints from timetotime and we have attempted to address this by qualifying multiple silicon foundries and by obtaining supply commitments in some cases in exchange for purchase or capital commitments by us 

our manufacturing strategy includes a balance of internal and external sites primarily for assembly and test operations which helps reduce costs provides flexibility of supply and minimizes the risk of supply disruption we routinely qualify multiple sources of supply and manufacturing sites to reduce the risk of supply interruptions or price increases and closely monitor suppliers’ key performance indicators our suppliers and our manufacturing sites are geographically diversified with our largest volume sources distributed throughout southern and eastern asia we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing needs 

customers 

we design develop manufacture and market products for leading us and international oems and odms we also collaborate with leading baseband reference design partners located primarily in the us and china 

we provided our products to our largest end customer apple inc apple through sales to multiple contract manufacturers which in the aggregate accounted for 36  34  and 37  of total revenue in fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively huawei technologies co ltd huawei accounted for 8  11  and 12  of our total revenue in fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively these customers primarily purchase cellular rf and wifi solutions offered by our mp segment for a variety of mobile devices including smartphones notebook computers wearables tablets and cellularbased applications for the iot 

some of our sales to overseas customers are made under export licenses that must be obtained from the united states department of commerce 

information about revenue including segment revenue operating profit or loss and total assets is presented in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

sales and marketing 

we sell our products worldwide directly to customers as well as through a network of domestic and foreign sales representative firms and distributors we select our domestic and foreign sales representatives based on technical skills and sales experience the presence of complementary product lines and the customer base served we provide ongoing training to our internal and external sales representatives and distributors to keep them educated about our products we maintain an internal sales and marketing organization that is responsible for key account management application engineering support for customers sales and advertising literature and technical presentations for industry conferences our sales and customer support centers are located near our customers throughout the world 

our website contains extensive product information and we publish a comprehensive product selection guide annually our global team of application engineers interacts with customers during all stages of design and production maintains regular contact with customer engineers provides product application notes and engineering data and assists in the resolution of technical problems we maintain close relationships with our customers and platform providers and provide them strong technical support to help anticipate future product needs and enhance their customer experience 

research and development 

we maintain a high level of investment in research and development rd to develop the advanced technologies and products necessary to lead in the markets we serve our rd activities focus primarily on large competitive design win opportunities for major programs at key customers which typically requires us to improve the yearoveryear functional density performance size and cost of our products we also devote significant rd resources for targeted development of new products for general release to various markets our rd efforts require us to focus on both continuous improvement in our processes for design and manufacture as well as innovation in fundamental areas like materials software and firmware semiconductor process technologies simulation and modeling systems architecture circuit design device packaging module integration and test 

we have developed several generations of gaas gan baw and saw process technologies that we manufacture internally we invest in these technologies to improve device performance reduce die size and reduce manufacturing costs we also help develop and qualify technologies made by key suppliers including soi for switches and rf signal conditioning solutions sige and inp for amplifiers and cmos for power management devices and soc solutions we combine these external technologies with our proprietary design methods intellectual property and other expertise to improve performance increase integration and reduce the size and cost of our products 

we invest in gan process technologies and continue to develop and release new ganbased products to exploit gan’s performance advantages the inherent wide band gap high electron mobility and high breakdown voltage characteristics of gan semiconductor devices offer significant performance advantages versus competing technologies 

we develop and qualify advanced packaging technologies to allow us to eliminate wire bonds reduce component size improve performance and reduce package costs we are also investing in large scale module assembly and test capabilities to bring these technologies to market in very high volumes 

in fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  we incurred approximately 4451 million  4708 million  and 4488 million  respectively in rd expenses we expect to continue to spend substantial funds on rd in support of our growth and product diversification 

competition 

we operate in a competitive industry characterized by rapid advances in technology and new product introductions our customers’ product life cycles are often short and our competitiveness depends on our ability to improve our products and processes faster than our competitors anticipate changing customer requirements and successfully develop and launch new products while reducing our costs our competitiveness is also affected by the quality of our customer service and technical support and our ability to design customized products that address each customer’s particular requirements within their cost limitations the selection process for our products to be included in our customers’ products is highly competitive and our customers provide no guarantees that our products will be included in the next generation of products introduced 

we compete primarily with the following companies analog devices inc broadcom limited macom technology solutions inc murata manufacturing co ltd northrop grumman corporation qualcomm technologies inc skyworks solutions inc and sumitomo electric device innovations 

many of our current and potential competitors have entrenched market positions and customer relationships established patents and other intellectual property and substantial technological capabilities in some cases our competitors are also our customers or suppliers additionally many of our competitors may have significantly 

greater financial technical manufacturing and marketing resources than we do which may allow them to implement new technologies and develop new products more quickly than we can 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets is important to our business and we actively seek opportunities to leverage our intellectual property portfolio to promote our business interests we also actively seek to monitor and protect our global intellectual property rights and to deter unauthorized use of our intellectual property and other assets such efforts can be difficult because of the absence of consistent international standards and laws moreover we respect the intellectual property rights of others and have implemented policies and procedures to mitigate the risk of infringing or misappropriating third party intellectual property 

patent applications are filed within the us and in other countries where we have a market presence on occasion some applications do not mature into patents for various reasons including rejections based on prior art in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws we have approximately 1300 patents that expire from 2018 to 2038 we also continue to acquire patents through acquisitions or direct prosecution efforts and engage in licensing transactions to secure the right to practice third parties’ patents in view of our rapid innovation and product development and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes there is no guarantee that our products will not be obsolete before the related patents expire or are granted however we believe the duration and scope of our most relevant patents are sufficient to support our business which as a whole is not significantly dependent on any particular patent or other intellectual property right as we expand our products and offerings we also seek to expand our patent prosecution efforts to cover such products 

we periodically register federal trademarks service marks and trade names that distinguish our product brand names in the market we also monitor these marks for their proper and intended use additionally we rely on nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our interest in confidential and proprietary information that gives us a competitive advantage including business strategies unpatented inventions designs and process technology such information is closely monitored and made available only to those employees whose responsibilities require access to the information 

backlog 

our sales are the result of standard purchase orders or specific agreements with customers we maintain qorvoowned finished goods inventory at certain customers’ hub locations and do not recognize revenue until our customers draw down the inventory at these hubs our customers’ projections of consumption of hub inventory and quantities on purchase orders as well as the shipment schedules are frequently revised within agreedupon lead times to reflect changes in the customers’ needs because industry practice allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment and with little or no penalty we believe that backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels 

employees 

on march 31 2018  we had more than 8300  employees we believe that our future prospects will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain skilled employees competition for skilled personnel is intense and the number of persons with relevant experience particularly in rf engineering product design and technical marketing is limited none of our us employees are represented by a labor union a number of our employees in germany less than 5 of our global workforce as of march 31 2018  are represented by internal works councils we have never experienced any work stoppage and we believe that our current employee relations are good 

geographic financial summary 

a summary of our operations by geographic area is as follows in thousands 



sales for geographic disclosure purposes are based on the “sold to” address of the customer the sold to address is not always an accurate representation of the location of final consumption of our products of our total revenue for fiscal 2018  approximately 52   15397 million  was attributable to customers in china and 19   5648 million  was attributable to customers in taiwan of our total revenue for fiscal years 2017  and 2016  approximately 62   18660 million  and 61   16010 million  respectively was attributable to customers in china and 13   3984 million  and 14   3651 million  respectively was attributable to customers in taiwan 

for financial information regarding our operations by geographic area see note 16  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report 

for a summary of certain risks associated with our foreign operations see item 1a risk factors 

  

environmental matters 

by virtue of operating our wafer fabrication facilities we are subject to a variety of extensive and changing domestic and international federal state and local governmental laws regulations and ordinances related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in the manufacturing process we provide our own manufacturing waste water pretreatment and disposal for most of our manufacturing facilities and we have contracted for the disposal of our hazardous waste state agencies require us to report storage and emissions of environmentally hazardous materials and we have retained appropriate personnel to help ensure compliance with all applicable environmental regulations we believe that costs arising from existing environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

we are an iso 140012015 certified manufacturer with a comprehensive environmental management system ems in place to help ensure control of the environmental aspects of the manufacturing process our ems mandates compliance and establishes appropriate checks and balances to minimize the potential for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations 

we actively monitor the hazardous materials that are used in the manufacture assembly and testing of our products particularly materials that are retained in the final product we have developed specific restrictions on the content of certain hazardous materials in our products as well as those of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers and subcontractors this helps to ensure that our products are compliant with the requirements of the markets into which the products will be sold and with our customers’ requirements for example our products are compliant with the european union rohs directive 201165eu on the restriction of use of hazardous substances which prohibits the sale in the european union market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing certain families of substances above a specified threshold 

we do not currently anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in fiscal 2019

 item 1a risk factors 

our operating results fluctuate 

our revenue earnings margins and other operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future if demand for our products fluctuates as a result of economic conditions or for other reasons our revenue and profitability could be impacted our future operating results will depend on many factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is likely that our future operating results could be adversely affected by one or more of the factors set forth above or other similar factors if our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market analysts or our investors our stock price may decline 

our operating results are substantially dependent on development of new products and achieving design wins as our industry’s product life cycles are short and our customers requirements change rapidly 

our largest markets are characterized by short product life cycles and the frequent introduction of new products in response to evolving product requirements driven by end user demand for more functionality improved performance lower costs and smaller form factors our largest mp customers typically refresh some or all of their product portfolios by releasing new models each year in some cases product designs we pursue represent either opportunities to substantially increase our revenue by winning a new design or a risk of a substantial revenue loss by losing an incumbent product in a customers device 

our future success is dependent on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely and costeffective manner and secure production orders from our customers the development of new products is a highly complex process and we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products at times in the past our successful product development depends on a number of factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to design and introduce new products in a timely or costefficient manner and our new products may fail to meet market or customer requirements most major product design opportunities that we pursue involve multiple competitors and we could lose a new product design opportunity to a competitor that offers a lower cost or equal or superior performing product if we are unsuccessful in achieving design wins against our competitors our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected even when a design win is achieved our success is not assured design wins may require significant expenditures by us and typically precede volume revenue by six to nine months or more many customers seek a second source for all major components in their devices which can significantly reduce the revenue obtained from a design win in many cases the average selling prices of our products decline over the products’ lives and we must achieve yield improvements cost reductions and other productivity enhancements in order to maintain profitability the actual value of a design win to us will ultimately depend on the commercial success of our customers’ products 

we depend on a few large customers for a substantial portion of our revenue 

a substantial portion of our mp revenue comes from large purchases by a small number of customers our future operating results depend on both the success of our largest customers and on our success in diversifying our products and customer base collectively our two  largest end customers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 44  45  and 49  of our revenue for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

we typically manufacture custom products on an exclusive basis for individual customers for a negotiated period of time increasingly the toptier cellular handset oems are releasing fewer new phone models on an annual basis which heightens the importance of achieving design wins for these larger opportunities while the financial rewards and market affirmation from a design win for these premier customers are greater competition for these projects is intense the concentration of our revenue with a relatively small number of customers makes us particularly dependent on factors both positive and negative affecting those customers if demand for their products increases our results are favorably impacted while if demand for their products decreases they may reduce their purchases of 

or stop purchasing our products and our operating results would suffer even if we achieve a design win our customers can delay or cancel the release of a new handset for any reason most of our customers can cease incorporating our products into their devices with little notice to us and with little or no penalty the loss of a large customer and failure to add new customers to replace lost revenue would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face risks of a loss of revenue if contracts with the united states government or defense and aerospace contractors are canceled or delayed or if defense spending is reduced 

we receive a portion of our revenue from the united states government and from prime contractors on united states governmentsponsored programs principally for defense and aerospace applications these programs are subject to delays or cancellation further spending on defense and aerospace programs can vary significantly depending on funding from the united states government we believe our government and defense and aerospace business has been negatively affected in the past by external factors such as sequestration and political pressure to reduce federal defense spending reductions in defense and aerospace funding or the loss of a significant defense and aerospace program or contract would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we depend heavily on third parties 

we purchase numerous component parts substrates and siliconbased products from external suppliers we also utilize thirdparty suppliers for numerous services including die processing wafer bumping test and tape and reel the use of external suppliers involves a number of risks including the possibility of material disruptions in the supply of key components and the lack of control over delivery schedules capacity constraints manufacturing yields product quality and fabrication costs 

although our key suppliers commit to us to be compliant with applicable iso 9001 andor ts16949 quality standards we have experienced quality and reliability issues in the past with certain suppliers quality or reliability issues in our supply chain could negatively affect our products our reputation and our results of operations 

we face risks related to sales through distributors   

we sell a significant portion of our products through third party distributors we depend on these distributors to help us create end customer demand provide technical support and other valueadded services to customers fill customer orders and stock our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products may be limited because our end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor due to advantages in the incumbent distributors’ technical support and favorable business terms related to payments discounts and stocking of acceptable inventory levels using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks including competitive pressure concentration credit risk and compliance risks other third parties may use one of our distributors to sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to the distributors to focus them on the sale of our products our distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by our distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

we face risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing facilities 

we operate wafer fabrication facilities in florida north carolina oregon and texas we currently use several international and domestic assembly suppliers as well as internal assembly facilities in china costa rica germany and the us to assemble and test our products we currently have our own test and tape and reel facilities located in china costa rica and the us and we also utilize contract suppliers and partners in asia to test our products 

a number of factors related to our facilities will affect our business and financial results including the following 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs 

our worldwide operations and business could be disrupted by natural disasters industrial accidents cybersecurity incidents telecommunications failures power or water shortages extreme weather conditions public health issues military actions acts of terrorism political or regulatory issues and other manmade disasters or catastrophic events we carry commercial property damage and business interruption insurance against various risks with limits we deem adequate for reimbursement for damage to our fixed assets and resulting disruption of our operations however the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses any disruptions from these events could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations and could also have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results to the extent that losses are uninsured or exceed insurance recoveries and to the extent that such disruptions adversely impact our relationships with our customers 

if we experience poor manufacturing yields our operating results may suffer 

our products have unique designs and are fabricated using multiple semiconductor process technologies that are highly complex in many cases our products are assembled in customized packages many of our products consist of multiple components in a single module and feature enhanced levels of integration and complexity our customers insist that our products be designed to meet their exact specifications for quality performance and reliability our manufacturing yield is a combination of yields across the entire supply chain including wafer fabrication assembly and test yields defects in a single component in an assembled module product can impact the yield for the entire module which means the adverse economic impacts of an individual defect can be multiplied many times over if we fail to discover the defect before the module is assembled due to the complexity of our products we periodically experience difficulties in achieving acceptable yields and other quality issues particularly with respect to new products 

our customers test our products once they have been assembled into their products the number of usable products that result from our production process can fluctuate as a result of many factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we constantly seek to improve our manufacturing yields typically for a given level of sales when our yields improve our gross margins improve and when our yields decrease our unit costs are higher our margins are lower and our operating results are adversely affected 

costs of product defects and deviations from required specifications could include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these costs could be significant and could reduce our gross margins our reputation with customers also could be damaged as a result of product defects and quality issues and product demand could be reduced which could harm our business and financial results 

we are subject to increased inventory risks and costs because we build our products based on forecasts provided by customers before receiving purchase orders for the products 

in order to ensure availability of our products for some of our largest end customers we start manufacturing certain products in advance of receiving purchase orders based on forecasts provided by these customers however these forecasts do not represent binding purchase commitments and we do not recognize sales for these products until they are shipped to or consumed by the customer as a result we incur significant inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales because demand for our products may not materialize or may be lower than expected manufacturing based on forecasts subjects us to heightened risks of higher inventory carrying costs increased obsolescence and higher operating costs these inventory risks are exacerbated when our customers purchase indirectly through contract manufacturers or hold component inventory levels greater than their consumption rate because this reduces our visibility regarding the customers’ accumulated levels of inventory if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to writeoff inventory which would have a negative impact on our gross margin and other operating results 

we sell certain of our products based on reference designs of platform providers and our inability to effectively manage or maintain our evolving relationships with these companies may have an adverse effect on our business 

platform providers are typically large companies that provide system reference designs for oems and odms that include the platform provider’s baseband and other complementary products a platform provider may own or control ip that gives it a strong market position for its baseband products for certain air interface standards which provides it with significant influence and control over sales of rf products for these standards platform providers historically looked to us and our competitors to provide rf products to their customers as part of the overall system design and we competed with other rf companies to have our products included in the platform provider’s system reference design this market dynamic has evolved in recent years as platform providers have worked to develop more fully integrated solutions that include their own rf technologies and components 

platform providers may be in a different business from ours or we may be their customer or direct competitor accordingly we must balance our interest in obtaining new business with competitive and other factors because platform providers control the overall system reference design if they offer competitive rf technologies or their own rf solutions as a part of their reference design and exclude our products from the design we are at a distinct competitive disadvantage with oems and odms that are seeking a turnkey design solution even if our products offer superior performance this requires us to work more closely with oems and odms to secure the design of our products in their handsets and other devices 

our relationships with platform providers are complex and evolving and the inability to effectively manage or maintain these relationships could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to risks from international sales and operations 

we operate globally with sales offices and rd activities as well as manufacturing assembly and testing facilities in multiple countries and some of our business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas as a result we are subject to regulatory geopolitical and other risks associated with doing business outside the us including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sales to customers located outside the us accounted for approximately 82  of our revenue in fiscal 2018  of which approximately 52  and 19  were attributable to sales to customers located in china and taiwan respectively we expect that revenue from international sales to china and other markets will continue to be a significant part of our total revenue any weakness in the chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for consumer products that contain our products which could materially and adversely affect our business the 

imposition by the us of tariffs on goods imported from china and other government actions that restrict our ability to sell our products to chinese customers and countermeasures imposed by china in response could directly or indirectly adversely impact our manufacturing costs and the sales of our products in china and other markets 

as a global company our results are affected by movements in currency exchange rates our exposure may increase or decrease over time as our foreign business levels fluctuate in the countries where we have operations and these changes could have a material impact on our financial results the functional currency for most of our international operations is the us dollar we have foreign operations in asia europe and costa rica and europe and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the us our international revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars operating expenses and certain working capital items related to our foreignbased operations are in some instances denominated in the local foreign currencies and therefore are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies such as the costa rican colon euro pound sterling renminbi and singapore dollar if the us dollar weakens compared to these and other currencies our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when remeasured back into us dollars 

economic regulation in china could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we have a significant portion of our assembly and testing capacity in china in recent years the chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation in response to these factors the chinese government has from time to time adopted measures to regulate growth and contain inflation including measures designed to restrict credit or to control prices such actions in the future as well as other changes in chinese laws and regulations could increase the cost of doing business in china or decrease the demand for our products in china which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we operate in a very competitive industry and must continue to implement innovative technologies 

we compete with several companies primarily engaged in the business of designing manufacturing and selling rf solutions as well as suppliers of discrete integrated circuits and modules in addition to our direct competitors some of our largest end customers and leading platform partners also compete with us to some extent by designing and manufacturing their own products increased competition from any source could adversely affect our operating results through lower prices for our products reduced demand for our products losses of existing design slots with key customers and a corresponding reduction in our ability to recover development engineering and manufacturing costs 

many of our existing and potential competitors have entrenched market positions historical affiliations with oems considerable internal manufacturing capacity established ip rights and substantial technological capabilities the semiconductor industry has experienced increased industry consolidation over the last several years a trend we expect to continue many of our existing and potential competitors may have greater financial technical manufacturing or marketing resources than we do we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully with our competitors 

industry overcapacity could cause us to underutilize our manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

it is difficult to predict future demand for our products which makes it difficult to estimate future requirements for production capacity capacity expansion projects have long lead times and require capital commitments based on forecasted product trends and demand well in advance of production orders from customers in recent years we have made significant capital investments to expand our baw saw and tcsaw filter capacity to address forecasted future demand patterns 

in the past capacity additions by us and our competitors sometimes exceeded demand requirements leading to overcapacity situations fluctuations in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products also lead to overcapacity and contribute to cyclicality in the semiconductor market 

as many of our manufacturing costs are fixed these costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues experienced during periods in which we underutilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of overcapacity if the demand for our products is not consistent with our expectations underutilization of our manufacturing facilities may have a material adverse effect on average selling prices our gross margin and other operating results if demand for our products experiences a prolonged decrease we may be required to write down our longlived assets or shorten the useful lives of underutilized assets and accelerate depreciation which would increase our expenses 

we may not be able to borrow funds under our credit facility or secure future financing 

on december 5 2017 we entered into a fiveyear unsecured senior credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement with bank of america na as administrative agent swing line lender and lc issuer and a syndicate of lenders the credit agreement the credit agreement includes a 3000 million  revolving credit facility which includes a 250 million  sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a 100 million  sublimit for swing line loans we may request at any time and from time to time that the revolving credit facility or the term loan as defined below be increased by an amount not to exceed 3000 million  the revolving credit facility is available to finance working capital capital expenditures and for other corporate purposes this facility contains various conditions covenants and representations with which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds we cannot assure that we will be in compliance with these conditions covenants and representations in the future when we may need to borrow funds under this facility 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt including our term loan and senior notes or to fund capital expenditures and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our debt obligations and financing requirements which may not be successful or on terms favorable to us 

the credit agreement also includes a 4000 million senior delayed draw term loan the term loan of which 1000 million was funded at closing and then subsequently repaid during march 2018 at our discretion we may draw down the remaining balance in up to two advances prior to june 5 2018 

in november 2015 we issued 4500 million  aggregate principal amount of 675  senior notes due 2023 the 2023 notes and 5500 million  aggregate principal amount of 700  senior notes due 2025 the 2025 notes and together with the 2023 notes the notes the notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of november 19 2015 the indenture in september 2016 we completed an exchange offer in which all of the 2023 notes and substantially all of the 2025 notes were exchanged for new notes that have been registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended the securities act our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations including the term loan and the notes and to fund working capital planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts and any strategic alliances or acquisitions we may make in the future depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we cannot be sure that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our debt including the term loan and the notes if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may face liquidity issues and be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt including the term loan and the notes these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service and other obligations additionally the agreements governing our credit agreement and the indenture governing the notes limit the use of the proceeds 

from any disposition as a result we may not be allowed under these documents to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy our debt service obligations further we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity and we cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the agreements and instruments governing our debt impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility 

the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the term loan and the indenture governing the notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these covenants could have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete in addition the credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants operating results below current levels or other adverse factors including a significant increase in interest rates could result in our being unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in our revolving credit facility if we violate covenants under the credit agreement and are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders our debt under our revolving credit facility would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders because of crossdefault provisions in the agreements and instruments governing our debt a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under and the acceleration of our other debt if our debt is accelerated we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if we are able to obtain new financing it may not be on commercially reasonable terms on terms that are acceptable to us or at all if our debt is in default for any reason our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions 

the price of our common stock may be volatile 

the price of our common stock which is traded on the nasdaq global select market has been and may continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in addition the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we cannot assure you that the price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future in addition the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to our performance 

our stock repurchases may fluctuate 

the amount and timing of our stock repurchases may fluctuate based on a number of factors including our priorities for the use of our cash for other purposes such as capital spending and acquisitions restrictions under securities laws and because of changes in our cash flows tax laws and the market price of our common stock 

we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders’ ownership cause us to incur debt and assume contingent liabilities or adversely affect our results of operations 

as part of our business strategy we expect to continue to review potential acquisitions and strategic investments that could complement our current product offerings augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth or margin improvement opportunities in the event of future acquisitions of businesses products or technologies we could issue equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership incur substantial debt or other financial obligations or assume contingent liabilities such actions could harm our results of operations or the price of our common stock acquisitions and strategic investments also entail numerous other risks that could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate key employees and our failure to do so could harm our business and our results of operations 

in order to compete effectively we must 

 

 

 

 

our future operating results and success depend on keeping key technical personnel and management and expanding our sales and marketing rd and administrative support we do not have employment agreements with the vast majority of our employees we must also continue to attract qualified personnel the competition for qualified personnel is intense and the number of people with experience particularly in rf engineering integrated circuit and filter design and technical marketing and support is limited in addition existing or new immigration laws policies or regulations in the us may limit the pool of available talent travels bans difficulties obtaining visas and other restrictions on international travel could make it more difficult to effectively manage our international operations collaborate as a global company or service our international customer base we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain skilled personnel in the future which could harm our business and our results of operations 

we rely on our intellectual property portfolio and may not be able to successfully protect against the use of our intellectual property by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that patents will be issued in all countries where our products can be sold further we cannot be certain that any claims allowed from pending applications will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection against our competitors our competitors may also be able to design around our patents 

the laws of some countries in which our products are developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws this increases the possibility of piracy of our technology and products although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology additionally our competitors may be able to independently develop noninfringing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours 

we may need to engage in legal actions to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights generally intellectual property litigation is both expensive and unpredictable our involvement in intellectual property litigation could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights 

our operating results may be adversely affected if third parties were to assert claims that our products infringed their patent copyright or other intellectual property rights such assertions could lead to expensive and unpredictable litigation diverting the attention of management and technical personnel an unsuccessful result in any such litigation could have adverse effects on our business which may include injunctions exclusion orders and royalty payments to third parties in addition if one of our customers or another supplier to one of our customers were found to be infringing on thirdparty intellectual property rights such finding could adversely affect the demand for our products 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our proprietary information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

we rely on trade secrets technical knowhow and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities to provide us with competitive advantages we protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants strategic partners and other third parties we also design our computer networks and implement various procedures to restrict unauthorized access to our proprietary information 

we face internal and external data security threats current departing or former employees or third parties could attempt to improperly use or access our computer systems and networks to copy obtain or misappropriate our proprietary information or otherwise interrupt our business like others we are also subject to significant system or network disruptions from numerous causes including computer viruses and other cyberattacks facility access issues new system implementations and energy blackouts 

security breaches computer malware phishing spoofing and other cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years while we defend against these threats on a daily basis we do not believe that such attacks to date have caused us any material damage because the techniques used by computer hackers and others to access or sabotage networks constantly evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate counter or ameliorate all of these techniques as a result our and our customers proprietary information may be misappropriated and the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted any loss of such information could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence in the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures or cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the incident we routinely implement improvements to our network security safeguards and we are devoting increasing resources to the security of our information technology systems we cannot however assure that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future cyberattack or network disruptions 

the costs related to cyberattacks or other security threats or computer systems disruptions typically would not be fully insured or indemnified by others occurrence of any of the events described above could result in loss of competitive advantages derived from our rd efforts or our ip moreover these events may result in the early obsolescence of our products product development delays or diversion of the attention of management and key information technology and other resources or otherwise adversely affect our internal operations and reputation or degrade our financial results and stock price 

we may be subject to theft loss or misuse of personal data by or about our employees customers or other third parties which could increase our expenses damage our reputation or result in legal or regulatory proceedings 

in the ordinary course of our business we have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information regarding our employees and others that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business or by our third party service providers including business process software applications providers and other vendors that have access to sensitive data could result in damage to our reputation disruption of our business activities significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims 

global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment for example the european union adopted the general data protection regulation gdpr which requires companies to meet new requirements beginning in may 2018 regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices complying with these changing laws has caused and could continue to cause us to incur substantial costs which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations further failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity finally even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal state or international privacy 

related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others 

we are subject to warranty claims product recalls and product liability 

from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expense we may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters and our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims 

product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and such insurance may be unavailable or inadequate to protect against all claims if one of our customers recalls a product containing one of our devices we may incur significant costs and expenses including replacement costs direct and indirect product recallrelated costs diversion of technical and other resources and reputational harm our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions relating to product quality issues the potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant and in some cases including in agreements with some of our largest end customers are potentially unlimited any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from sale of the relevant products costs payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to risks associated with environmental health and safety regulations and climate change 

we are subject to a broad array of us and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations include those related to the use transportation storage handling emission discharge and recycling or disposal of hazardous materials used in our manufacturing assembly and testing processes our failure to comply with any of these existing or future laws or regulations could result in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existing and future environmental laws and regulations could also impact our product designs and limit or restrict the materials or components that are included in our products in addition many of our largest end customers require us to comply with corporate social responsibility policies which often include employment health safety environmental and other requirements that exceed applicable legal requirements compliance with these policies increases our operating expenses and noncompliance can adversely affect customer relationships and harm our business 

new climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or procure substitute raw materials that may cost more or be more difficult to procure in addition new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in increased costs for us and our suppliers various jurisdictions are developing other climate changebased regulations that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results we expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future future compliance with these laws and regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

compliance with regulations regarding the use of “conflict minerals” could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

regulations in the us currently require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products referred to as conflict minerals originated in the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries or were from recycled or scrap sources the verification and reporting requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals that are used in the manufacture of our products we have incurred costs and expect to incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements additionally we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement we may also face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently make any required determination that the metals used in our products are conflict free 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying deterring preventing or rendering more difficult a change in control of qorvo that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests these provisions include 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the general corporation law of the state of delaware contains provisions that regulate “business combinations” between corporations and interested stockholders who own 15 or more of the corporation’s voting stock except under certain circumstances these provisions could also discourage potential acquisition proposals and delay or prevent a change in control 

these provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit of any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context and may also make it more difficult for a third party to replace directors on our board of directors further the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 

our operating results could vary as a result of the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see critical accounting policies and estimates  in part ii item 7 of this report such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments that could significantly affect our results of operations 

decisions we make about the scope of our future operations could affect our future financial results 

from time to time changes in the business environment have led us to change the scope of our operations or business which has resulted in restructuring and asset impairment charges and this could occur in the future the 

amount and timing of such charges can be difficult to predict factors that contribute to the amount and timing of such charges include 

 

 

 

 

changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in china germany singapore the us and numerous other foreign taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuations as it is impacted by a number of factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

changes in the favorable tax status of our subsidiaries in costa rica and singapore would have an adverse impact on our operating results 

our subsidiaries in costa rica and singapore have been granted tax holidays that effectively minimize our tax expense and that are expected to be effective through march 2024 and december 2021 respectively in their efforts to deal with budget deficits governments around the world are focusing on increasing tax revenues through increased audits and potentially increased tax rates for corporations as part of this effort governments continue to review their policies on granting tax holidays in february 2017 singapore enacted legislation that will exclude from our existing development and expansion incentive grant the benefit of the reduced tax rate for intellectual property income earned after june 30 2021 future changes in the status of either tax holiday could have a negative effect on our net income in future years 

the impact of new us tax legislation is uncertain and could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which includes a number of changes to us tax laws that impact us including a reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings 

based on our current analysis of the changes enacted by the tax act it will continue to have a significant impact on our results of operations 

the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the united states treasury department the internal revenue service and other standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our initial interpretation as we complete our analysis of the tax act review all information collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance we may adjust the initial provisional amounts that we have recorded which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

the organisation for economic cooperation and development base erosion and profit shifting initiative on tax policy and enacted laws in the countries in which we operate could increase our tax obligations 

many countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and action plan which aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder tax transfer pricing documentation rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices if these changes are adopted by countries in which we do business our tax obligations in these countries could increase furthermore as a result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities and legislative investigation and inquiry which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings any such changes in policies or rulings may also increase our effective tax rate or result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change which may harm our financial position and results of operations

fiscal 2018  management summary 

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

results of operations 

consolidated 

the following table presents a summary of our results of operations for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  



revenue 

our overall revenue decreased   590 million  or 19  in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily due to lower demand for our cellular rf solutions in support of customers based in china partially offset by higher demand for our defense and aerospace and wifi products as well as higher demand for our cellular rf solutions in support of our largest end customer 

our overall revenue increased 4218 million  or 162  in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to higher demand for our cellular rf solutions in support of marquee smartphones and customers based in china and higher sales of our wireless infrastructure defense and aerospace and wifi products 

we provided our products to our largest end customer apple through sales to multiple contract manufacturers which in the aggregate accounted for 36  34  and 37  of total revenue in fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively huawei accounted for approximately 8  11  and 12  of our total revenue in fiscal years 2018  2017   

and 2016  respectively these customers primarily purchase cellular rf and wifi solutions offered by our mp segment for a variety of mobile devices including smartphones notebook computers wearables tablets and cellularbased applications for the iot 

international shipments amounted to 24491 million  in fiscal 2018  approximately 82  of revenue compared to 25655 million  in fiscal 2017  approximately 85  of revenue and 23044 million  in fiscal 2016  approximately 88  of revenue shipments to asia totaled 23293 million  in fiscal 2018  approximately 78  of revenue compared to 24411 million  in fiscal 2017  approximately 81  of revenue and 21621 million  in fiscal 2016  approximately 83  of revenue we expect our international and asia shipments will remain relatively stable at these historical levels 

gross margin 

our overall gross margin for fiscal 2018  was 386  as compared to 374  in fiscal 2017  the increase was primarily due to improved manufacturing and test yields on certain highvolume parts lower depreciation favorable changes in product mix within our cellular rf solutions and growth in demand for our idp products this increase in gross margin was partially offset by lower factory utilization average selling price erosion and higher intangible amortization 

our overall gross margin for fiscal 2017  was 374  as compared to 402  in fiscal 2016  gross margin was adversely impacted in fiscal 2017  by an unfavorable change in product mix towards lower margin lowband pad modules product cost reductions lagging normal average selling price erosion lower factory utilization and unfavorable inventory adjustments primarily due to lower than expected manufacturing and assembly yields on the lowband pad modules in the second quarter of fiscal 2017  the lower yield was associated with the device packaging not device functionality however the impact was significant because the issue was identified late in the production process these adverse factors were partially offset by lower intangible amortization stockbased compensation and other costs related to the business combination in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  

  

operating expenses   

research and development   

in fiscal 2018  rd spending decreased   257 million  or 55  as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily due to lower personnelrelated costs as well as cost savings resulting from the ongoing efforts to optimize our product portfolio and the restructuring actions initiated in fiscal 2018 

in fiscal 2017  rd spending increased 221 million  or 49  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily driven by costs associated with the design and development of highperformance filterbased products and ganbased technologies and products the increased rd expense was partially offset by lower stockbased compensation expense 

selling general and administrative   

in fiscal 2018  selling general and administrative expense decreased   178 million  or 33  as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily due to lower personnelrelated costs as well as cost savings resulting from the restructuring actions initiated in fiscal 2018 

in fiscal 2017  selling general and administrative expense increased 115 million  or 22  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs partially offset by lower stockbased compensation expense 

other operating expense 

in fiscal 2018  other operating expense was 1038 million  in fiscal 2018  we initiated restructuring actions to improve operating efficiencies and as a result of these actions we recorded approximately 183 million  of employee termination benefits and adjusted the carrying value of certain held for sale assets located in china and the us to fair market value resulting in impairment charges totaling approximately 463 million  pursuant to accounting standards codification asc 360 property plant and equipment  in fiscal 2018  we also recorded integration costs and restructuring costs of 62 million  and 26 million  respectively associated with the 

business combination as well as 243 million  of startup costs related to new processes and operations in both existing and new facilities 

in fiscal 2017  other operating expense was 310 million  including integration costs of 169 million  and restructuring costs of 20 million  associated with the business combination as well as 97 million  of startup costs related to new processes and operations in both existing and new facilities 

in fiscal 2016  other operating expense was 547 million  including integration costs of 265 million  and restructuring costs of 101 million  including stockbased compensation associated with the business combination as well as 141 million  of startup costs related to new processes and operations in both existing and new facilities 

operating income 

our overall operating income was 703 million  for fiscal 2018  as compared to 881 million  for fiscal 2017  this decrease was primarily due to onetime restructuring charges partially offset by lower personnelrelated costs as well as cost savings resulting from the restructuring initiative and ongoing efforts to optimize our product portfolio 

our overall operating income was 881 million  for fiscal 2017  as compared to 120 million  for fiscal 2016  this increase was primarily due to higher gross profit from higher revenue and lower intangible amortization stockbased compensation and other costs related to the business combination partially offset by lower gross margin 

segment product revenue operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue 

mobile products 



mp revenue decreased   2029 million  or 85  in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily due to lower demand for our cellular rf solutions in support of customers based in china partially offset by higher demand for our cellular rf solutions in support of our largest end customer 

the increase in mp operating income as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher gross margin and lower operating expense gross margin increased primarily due to favorable changes in product mix within our cellular rf solutions lower depreciation and improved manufacturing and test yields on certain highvolume parts this increase in gross margin was partially offset by average selling price erosion and lower factory utilization operating expense decreased primarily due to lower personnelrelated costs as well as cost savings resulting from restructuring actions that were initiated during fiscal 2018 to improve operating efficiencies and ongoing efforts to optimize our product portfolio 

mp revenue increased 3007 million  or 144  in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to higher demand for our cellular rf solutions in support of marquee smartphones and customers based in china 

the decrease in mp operating income as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower gross margin gross margin was adversely impacted in fiscal 2017 by an unfavorable change in product mix towards lower margin lowband pad modules product cost reductions lagging normal average selling price erosion lower factory utilization and unfavorable inventory adjustments primarily due to lower than expected manufacturing assembly yields on the lowband pad modules in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 the lower yield was associated with the device packaging not device functionality however the impact was significant because the issue was identified late in the production process 

infrastructure and defense products 



idp revenue increased   1438 million  or 223  in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily due to higher demand for our defense and aerospace and wifi products 

idp operating income increased   832 million  or 545  in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily due to higher demand for our defense and aerospace and wifi products 

idp revenue increased 1211 million  or 231  in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to higher sales of our wireless infrastructure defense and aerospace and wifi products 

the increase in idp operating income as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  was driven by higher gross profit from increased revenue favorable factory utilization and lower unfavorable inventory adjustments this increase in gross profit was partially offset by higher personnelrelated expenses 

see note 16  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of segment operating income to the consolidated operating income for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  

change in estimate 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 we changed our accounting estimate for the expected useful lives of certain machinery and equipment we evaluated our current asset base and reassessed the estimated useful lives of certain machinery and equipment in connection with the implementation of several capital projects including the migration of certain saw processes from 4inch to 6inch toolsets and certain baw processes from 6inch to 8inch toolsets based on our ability to reuse equipment across generations of process technologies and historical usage trends we determined that the expected useful lives for certain machinery and equipment should be increased by up to three years to reflect more closely the estimated economic lives of those assets this change in estimate was applied prospectively effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and resulted in a decrease in depreciation expense of 597 million  for fiscal 2018 this decrease in depreciation expense for fiscal 2018 resulted in the following 1 an increase in income from operations of 474 million  2 an increase in net income of 441 million  3 an improvement in earnings per share of 034  and 4 a reduction in inventory of 123 million  

other expense income and income taxes 



interest expense   

we recognized 705 million  699 million  and 258 million  of interest expense in fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively primarily related to the 10 billion  of senior notes that were issued in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 interest expense in the preceding table for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  is net of capitalized interest of 136 million  136 million  and 52 million  respectively 

other expense income 

  

other expense in fiscal 2018  of approximately 06 million  was related primarily to a net loss from foreign currency offset by a gain on investments the foreign currency loss was driven primarily by the depreciation of the us dollar against the euro and singapore dollar as well as by the changes in the local currency denominated balance sheet accounts other expense in fiscal 2017  of approximately 31 million  was related primarily to a net loss from foreign currency the foreign currency loss was driven primarily by the appreciation of the us dollar against the renminbi as well as by the changes in the local currency denominated balance sheet accounts in fiscal 2016 we recognized other income primarily due to a gain from the sale of equity securities 

income tax expense 

income tax expense for fiscal 2018  was 574 million  which was primarily comprised of tax expense related to the net 773 million  provisional impact of the tax act international operations generating pretax book income and an increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits offset by tax benefits related to tax credits and domestic and international operations generating pretax book losses for fiscal 2018  this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 3350  

the impact of the tax act resulted in a provisional net tax expense of 773 million  in fiscal 2018  this was comprised of a provisional transitional repatriation tax expense of 1164 million  offset by a provisional deferred tax benefit of 391 million  from the remeasurement of us deferred tax assets and liabilities both the tax charge and the tax benefit represent provisional amounts based on current best estimates 

income tax expense for fiscal 2017  was 439 million  which was primarily comprised of tax expense related to domestic and international operations generating pretax book income and an increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits offset by tax benefits related to tax credits and international operations generating pretax book losses for fiscal 2017  this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 1606  

income tax expense for fiscal 2016  was 260 million  which was primarily comprised of tax expense related to international operations an increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits and a 251 million  increase in the valuation allowance against domestic state tax net operating loss and credit deferred tax assets and foreign net operating loss deferred tax assets offset by tax benefits arising from domestic operations and tax credits for fiscal 2016  this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 9080  

a valuation allowance has been established against deferred tax assets in the taxing jurisdictions where based upon the positive and negative evidence available it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized realization is dependent upon generating future income in the taxing jurisdictions in which the operating loss carryovers credit carryovers depreciable tax basis and other deferred tax assets exist management reevaluates the ability to realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis as of the end of fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  the valuation allowance against domestic and foreign deferred tax assets was 428 million  331 million  and 347 million  respectively 

see note 12 of the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding income taxes 

stockbased compensation 

under financial accounting standards board fasb asc 718 “compensation – stock compensation”  stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award using an option pricing model for stock options blackscholes and market price for restricted stock units and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period 

as of march 31 2018  total remaining unearned compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units and options was 728 million  which will be amortized over the weightedaverage remaining service period of approximately 12 years  

liquidity and capital resources 

cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity as of march 31 2018  we had working capital of approximately 14025 million  including 9260 million  in cash and cash equivalents compared to working capital of 10428 million  including 5455 million  in cash and cash equivalents as of april 1 2017  

our 9260 million  of total cash and cash equivalents as of march 31 2018  includes approximately 2929 million  held by our foreign subsidiaries of which 1908 million  is held by qorvo international pte ltd in singapore if the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are needed in the us we may be required to accrue and pay state income andor foreign local withholding taxes to repatriate these earnings our current plans are to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries except for the earnings of qorvo international pte ltd 

credit agreement 

on december 5 2017 we and certain of our material domestic subsidiaries the “guarantors” entered into a fiveyear unsecured senior credit facility with bank of america na as administrative agent swing line lender and lc issuer and a syndicate of lenders the “credit agreement” on the same date in connection with the execution of the credit agreement we terminated our prior credit agreement dated april 7 2015 

the credit agreement includes a senior delayed draw term loan of up to 4000 million  the term loan and a 3000 million  revolving line of credit the revolving facility together with the term loan the credit facility in december 2017 1000 million  of the term loan was funded and this amount was subsequently repaid in march 2018 the remainder of the term loan is available at our discretion in up to two draws prior to june 5 2018  the revolving facility includes a 250 million  sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a 100 million  sublimit for swing line loans we may request at any time that the credit facility be increased by an amount not to exceed 3000 million  the credit facility is available to finance working capital capital expenditures and other corporate purposes our obligations under the credit agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed by the guarantors outstanding amounts are due in full on the maturity date of december 5 2022  with amounts borrowed under the swing line option due in full no later than ten business days after such loan is made we had no outstanding amounts under the credit facility as of march 31 2018  

see note 8  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report for further information about the credit agreement including applicable interest rates and financial covenants as of march 31 2018 we were in compliance with all the financial covenants under the credit agreement 

stock repurchases   

on november 5 2015 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to 10 billion  of our outstanding common stock through november 4 2016 on february 16 2016 as part of the 10 billion  share repurchase program we entered into variable maturity accelerated share repurchase asr agreements a 2500 million collared agreement and a 2500 million uncollared agreement with bank of america na for the upfront payment of 5000 million in fiscal 2016 we received an aggregate of 100 million  shares of our common stock under the asr agreements final settlements of the asr agreements were completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with 04 million  shares received resulting in a total of 104 million  shares of our common stock repurchased under the asr agreements 

on november 3 2016 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to 5000 million  of our outstanding stock under this program share repurchases are made in accordance with applicable securities laws on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the extent to which we repurchase our shares the number of shares and the timing of any repurchases will depend on general market conditions regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other considerations the program does not require us to repurchase a minimum number of shares does not have a fixed term and may be modified suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice this program included approximately 1500 million  authorized on the 10 billion  repurchase program that expired november 4 2016 

we repurchased 29 million  shares 41 million  shares inclusive of the 04 million  shares received in final settlement of the asr agreement and 243 million  shares inclusive of the 100 million  shares initially received under the asr 

agreement of our common stock during fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively at an aggregate cost of 2199 million  2094 million  and 13000 million  respectively in accordance with the share repurchase programs described above as of march 31 2018  1621 million  remains available for future repurchases under our current share repurchase program 

cash flows from operating activities   

operating activities in fiscal 2018  provided cash of 8525 million  compared to 7768 million  in fiscal 2017  this yearoveryear increase was primarily due to changes in working capital the tax act did not have an impact on our fiscal 2018 cash flows from operating activities 

operating activities in fiscal 2017  provided cash of 7768 million  compared to 6879 million  in fiscal 2016  this yearoveryear increase was due primarily to improvement in working capital partially offset by lower adjustments for noncash items the adjustments for noncash items were lower due primarily to stockbased compensation expense and deferred taxes partially offset by higher depreciation 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2018  was 2774 million  compared to 4903 million  in fiscal 2017  this yearoveryear decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to capital expenditures incurred in fiscal 2017 that increased premium filter capacity and manufacturing cost saving initiatives 

net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2017  was 4903 million  compared to 2787 million  in fiscal 2016  this increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures related to projects for increasing premium filter capacity and manufacturing cost savings initiatives and the acquisition of greenpeak technologies bv greenpeak partially offset by higher net proceeds from availableforsale securities 

  

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2018  was 1968 million  compared to 1657 million  in fiscal 2017  this yearoveryear increase was primarily due to higher share repurchase activity higher tax withholding paid on behalf of employees for restricted stock units and debt payments 

net cash used in financing activities in 2017  was 1657 million  compared to 2830 million  in fiscal 2016  this decrease was primarily due to lower share repurchase activity partially offset by lower net proceeds from borrowings 

our future capital requirements may differ materially from those currently anticipated and will depend on many factors including market acceptance of and demand for our products acquisition opportunities technological advances and our relationships with suppliers and customers based on current and projected levels of cash flow from operations coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents and our credit facility we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet both our shortterm and longterm cash requirements however if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products or if our revenue grows faster than we anticipate operating cash flows may be insufficient to meet our needs if existing resources and cash from operations are not sufficient to meet our future requirements or if we perceive conditions to be favorable we may seek additional debt or equity financing additional equity or debt financing could be dilutive to holders of our common stock further we cannot be sure that additional equity or debt financing if required will be available on favorable terms if at all 

impact of inflation 

we do not believe that the effects of inflation had a significant impact on our revenue or operating income during fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of march 31 2018  we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments in thousands as of march 31 2018  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 



1 capital commitments represent obligations for the construction or purchase of property and equipment they were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet because we had not received the related goods or services as of march 31 2018  

2 longterm debt obligations represent future cash payments of principal and interest over the life of the notes including anticipated interest payments not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of march 31 2018  debt obligations are classified based on their stated maturity date and any future redemptions would impact our cash payments see note 8  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report for further information 

3 the capital lease obligation relates to a lease that was signed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 this lease will allow us to consolidate several leased facilities as well as provide additional manufacturing space in beijing china the lease is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of march 31 2018  because the lease term is not expected to commence until fiscal 2020 

4 other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various contracts as well as agreements to purchase materials and manufacturing services they are not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet because we had not received the related goods or services as of march 31 2018  

5 the crosslicensing liability represents payables under a crosslicensing agreement and are included in accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of march 31 2018  

6 commitments for deferred compensation represent the liability under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan see note 9  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report for further information 

other contractual obligations   

as of march 31 2018  in addition to the amounts shown in the contractual obligations table above we had 1274 million  of unrecognized income tax benefits and accrued interest of which 183 million  had been recorded as a liability we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 

as discussed in note 9  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report we have two pension plans in germany with a combined benefit obligation of approximately 127 million  as of march 31 2018  pension benefit payments are not included in the schedule above because they are not available for all periods presented pension benefit payments were approximately 02 million  in fiscal 2018  and are expected to be approximately 03 million  in fiscal 2019  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to use judgment and estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management our critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies however these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report 

inventory reserves the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons generally 12 to 24 months the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory reserves are the same as those used in our revenue forecasts and are also consistent with the estimates used in our manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base market conditions and customer acceptance of our products and technologies as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost 

historically inventory reserves have fluctuated as new technologies have been introduced and customers’ demand has shifted inventory reserves had an impact on margins of less than 2  in fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  

property and equipment periodically we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property and equipment considering factors such as changes in machinery and equipment technology our ability to reuse equipment across generations of process technology and historical usage trends when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the revised useful lives of the assets 

we assess property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include an adverse change in our use of the assets or an expectation that the assets will be sold or otherwise disposed we assess the recoverability of the assets held for use by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts assets identified as “held for sale” are recorded at the lesser of their carrying value or their fair market value less costs to sell impairment if any is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets the process of evaluating property and equipment for impairment is highly subjective and requires significant judgment as we are required to make assumptions about items such as future demand for our products and industry trends 

goodwill and intangible assets   goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for a business exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired intangibles are recorded when such assets are acquired by purchase or license the value of our intangibles including goodwill could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results ii a decline in the value of technology company stocks including the value of our common stock iii a prolonged or more significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the semiconductor industry or iv failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results    

we account for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in accordance with the fasbs guidance which requires annual testing for impairment or whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred   we perform our annual impairment tests on the first day of the fourth quarter in each fiscal year our indefinitelived intangible assets consist of inprocess research and development iprd 

we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment commonly referred to as step zero to determine whether further quantitative analysis for impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets is necessary in performing step zero for our impairment test we are required to make assumptions and judgments including the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to our business industry and market trends and the overall future financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate we also consider recent fair value calculations of our indefinitelived intangible assets and reporting units as well as cost factors such as changes in raw materials labor or other costs if the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinitelived asset is less than its respective carrying value including goodwill then we would perform an additional quantitative analysis for goodwill this involves a twostep process the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit including its goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then the second step of the process is performed to determine the amount of impairment the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recognized for the amount the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 

for indefinitelived intangible assets the quantitative analysis compares the carrying value of the asset to its fair value and an impairment charge is recognized for the amount its carrying value exceeds its fair value 

determining the fair value of reporting units indefinitelived intangible assets and implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill is reliant upon estimated future revenues profitability and cash flows and consideration of market factors assumptions judgments and estimates are complex subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts although we believe the assumptions judgments and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate different assumptions judgments and estimates could materially affect our results of operations 

goodwill 

goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the expected benefit from the synergies of the business combinations generating the underlying goodwill   for fiscal 2018  we performed a qualitative assessment of the fair value of our reporting units and as a result of our analysis we determined that there were no indicators of impairment and no further quantitative impairment test was deemed necessary 

for fiscal 2017 we performed a qualitative assessment of the fair value of our reporting units and as a result of our analysis we determined that there were no indicators of impairment and no further quantitative impairment test was deemed necessary 

for fiscal 2016 although there were no indicators of impairment we opted to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded to perform fair value assessments of our reporting units the first step of the quantitative impairment analysis as the fair value of the reporting units had changed due to the business combination since the last time we performed a quantitative analysis the quantitative assessments performed reaffirmed that there were no indicators of impairment for fiscal 2016 

in performing these quantitative assessments consistent with our historical approach we used both the income and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units the income approach involves discounting future estimated cash flows the sum of the reporting unit cash flow projections was compared to our market capitalization in a discounted cash flow framework to calculate an overall implied internal rate of return or discount rate for the company our market capitalization was adjusted to a control basis assuming a reasonable control premium which resulted in an implied discount rate this implied discount rate serves as a baseline for estimating the specific discount rate for each reporting unit 

the discount rate used is the valueweighted average of our estimated cost of equity and debt “cost of capital” derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics our weighted average cost of capital is adjusted for each reporting unit to reflect a risk factor if necessary for each reporting unit we perform sensitivity tests with respect to growth rates and discount rates used in the income approach we 

believe the income approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the respective reporting unit’s expected longterm operations and cash flow performance 

we considered historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates used in our analysis for fiscal 2016 the material assumptions used for the income approach were eight  years of projected net cash flows and a longterm growth rate of 3  for both the mp and idp reporting units a discount rate of 15  and 16  was used for the mp and idp reporting units respectively 

in applying the market approach valuation multiples are derived from historical and projected operating data of selected guideline companies which are evaluated and adjusted if necessary based on the strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit relative to the selected guideline companies the valuation multiples are then applied to the appropriate historical andor projected operating data of the reporting unit to arrive at an indication of fair value we believe the market approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value using multiples from companies with operations and economic characteristics similar to its reporting units we weighted the results of the income approach and the results of the market approach at 50 each and for the mp and idp reporting units concluded that the fair value of the reporting units was determined to be substantially in excess of the carrying value and as such no further analysis was warranted 

under the income approach the following indicates the sensitivity of key assumptions utilized in the assessment a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the fair value of the mp and idp reporting units by approximately 6600 million  and 1400 million  respectively while a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would have decreased the fair value of the mp and idp reporting units by approximately 5600 million  and 1100 million  respectively a one percentage point decrease in the longterm growth rate would have decreased the fair value of the mp and idp reporting units by approximately 2900 million  and 500 million  respectively while a one percentage point increase in the longterm growth rate would have increased the fair value of the mp and idp reporting units by approximately 3400 million  and 700 million  respectively 

intangible assets with indefinite lives 

in fiscal 2015 as a result of the business combination we recorded iprd of 4700 million  iprd was recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition as an indefinitelived intangible asset until t he completion or abandonment of the associated rd efforts or impairment the fair value of the acquired iprd was determined based on an income approach using the excess earnings method which   estimated the value of the intangible assets by discounting the future projected earnings of the asset to present value as of the valuation date upon completion of development acquired iprd assets are transferred to finitelived intangible assets and amortized over their useful lives during fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  we completed and transferred into developed technology approximately 370 million  2200 million  and 2030 million  respectively of iprd we performed a qualitative assessment of the remaining iprd of 100 million  during fiscal 2018  and concluded that iprd was not impaired 

intangible assets  with definite lives 

intangible assets are recorded when such assets are acquired by purchase or license    finitelived intangible assets consist primarily of technology licenses customer relationships developed technology and trade names resulting from business combinations and are subject to amortization 

technology licenses are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straightline basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the technology or the term of the license agreement ranging from approximately five  to eight  years 

the fair value of customer relationships acquired during fiscal years 2013 2015 and 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the “with and without method in which the value of the asset is determined by the difference in discounted cash flows of the profitability of the company with the asset and the profitability of the company without the asset customer relationships are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life ranging from three  to ten  years 

the fair value of developed technology acquired during fiscal years 2013 2015 and 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the excess earnings method which estimated the value of the intangible assets by discounting the future projected earnings of the asset to present value as of the valuation date developed technology is amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life ranging from three  to six  years 

the fair value of trade names acquired in fiscal years 2015 and 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method in which the value of the asset is determined by discounting the future projected cash flows generated from the trade names estimated royalties trade names are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of two  to three  years 

the fair value of the noncompete agreements acquired in fiscal 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the incremental income method over the useful life of two  years 

we regularly review identified intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life has changed from the original estimate or that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable if such facts and circumstances exist we assess the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts impairments if any are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the impairment determination was made 

revenue recognition   net revenue is generated principally from sales of semiconductor products we recognize revenue from product sales when the fundamental criteria are met such as the time at which the title and risk and rewards of product ownership are transferred to the customer price and terms are fixed or determinable no significant vendor obligation exists and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

sales of products are generally made through either our sales force manufacturers representatives or through a distribution network revenue from the majority of our products is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer from a companyowned or thirdparty location some revenue is recognized upon receipt of the shipment by the customer we have limited rebate programs offering price protection to certain distributors these rebates represented approximately 5  of net revenue in fiscal 2018  and can be reasonably estimated based on specific criteria included in the rebate agreements and other known factors at the time we reduce revenue and record reserves for product returns and allowances for price protection stock rotation and scrap allowance based on historical experience or specific identification depending on the contractual terms of the arrangement 

we also recognize a portion of our net revenue through other agreements such as nonrecurring engineering fees contracts for rd work royalty income intellectual property ip revenue and service revenue these agreements are collectively less than 1  of our consolidated annual revenue revenue from these agreements is recognized when the service is completed or upon certain milestones as provided for in the agreements 

revenue from certain contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the costs incurred to date and the total contract amount plus the contractual fee if these contracts experience cost overruns the percentage of completion method is used to determine revenue recognition revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized when the required deliverable is satisfied 

royalty income is recognized based on a percentage of sales of the relevant product reported by licensees during the period 

in addition we license or sell our rights to use portions of our ip portfolio which includes certain patent rights useful in the manufacture and sales of certain products ip revenue recognition is dependent on the terms of each agreement we will recognize ip revenue upon delivery of the ip if we have no substantive future obligation to perform under the arrangement we will defer recognition of ip revenue where future performance obligations are required to earn the revenue or the revenue is not guaranteed revenue from services is recognized during the period that the service is performed 

accounts receivable are recorded for all revenue items listed above and do not bear interest we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations after the original sale we will record an allowance against amounts due and thereby reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected for all other customers we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due industry and geographic concentrations the current business environment and our historical experience 

our terms and conditions do not give our customers a right of return associated with the original sale of our products however we will authorize sales returns under certain circumstances which include perceived quality problems courtesy returns and likekind exchanges we evaluate our estimate of returns by analyzing all types of returns and the timing of such returns in relation to the original sale reserves are adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated returns versus the original sale of product 

income taxes    in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

as part of our financial process we assess on a tax jurisdictional basis the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not more likely than not a likelihood of less than 50 percent the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to ultimately be recoverable in this process certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the amount of income or loss in prior years the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies changes in taxable income market conditions us or international tax laws and other factors may change our judgment regarding whether we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets these changes if any may require material adjustments to the net deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding changes in the valuation allowance and net deferred tax assets 

as part of our financial process we also assess the likelihood that our tax reporting positions will ultimately be sustained to the extent it is determined it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of a tax reporting position will ultimately not be recognized and sustained a provision for unrecognized tax benefit is provided by either reducing the applicable deferred tax asset or accruing an income tax liability our judgment regarding the sustainability of our tax reporting positions may change in the future due to changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to the related deferred tax assets or accrued income tax liabilities and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions and the amount of unrecognized tax benefits

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to seek a reduction in the potential negative earnings effects from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity prices arising from our business activities we manage these financial exposures through operational means and by using various financial instruments these practices may change as economic conditions change 

interest rates   

the interest rates under our credit agreement are variable however since we have no outstanding balances under the credit agreement there is no interest rate risk related to this facility as of march 31 2018  

currency exchange rates 

as a global company our results are affected by movements in currency exchange rates our exposure may increase or decrease over time as our foreign business levels fluctuate in the countries where we have operations and these changes could have a material impact on our financial results the functional currency for most of our international operations is the us dollar we have foreign operations in asia costa rica and europe and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the us our international revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars operating expenses and certain working capital items related to our foreignbased operations are in some instances denominated in the local foreign currencies and therefore are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies such as the costa rican colon euro pound sterling renminbi and singapore dollar if the us dollar weakens compared to these and other currencies our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when remeasured back into us dollars we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means 

for fiscal 2018  we incurred a foreign currency loss of 28 million  as compared to a loss of 32 million  in fiscal 2017  which is recorded in “other expense income” 

  

our financial instrument holdings including foreign receivables cash and payables at march 31 2018  were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes in this sensitivity analysis we assumed that the change in one currencys rate relative to the us dollar would not have an effect on other currencies rates relative to the us dollar all other factors were held constant if the us dollar declined in value 10 in relation to the remeasured foreign currency instruments our net income would have decreased  by approximately 27 million  if the us dollar increased in value 10 in relation to the remeasured foreign currency instruments our net income would have increased  by approximately 22 million  

commodity prices 

we routinely use precious metals in the manufacture of our products supplies for such commodities may from time to time become restricted or general market factors and conditions may affect the pricing of such commodities we also have an active reclamation process to capture any unused gold while we continue to attempt to mitigate the risk of similar increases in commoditiesrelated costs there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully safeguard against potential shortterm and longterm commodity price fluctuations

manufacturing 

the majority of our products are multichip modules utilizing multiple semiconductor process technologies these products have varying degrees of complexity and contain semiconductors and other components that are manufactured inhouse or outsourced we are a leading supplier of rf solutions and a leading manufacturer of gaas hbt gaas phemt gan saw tcsaw and baw products 

we operate wafer fabrication facilities for the production of gaas gan saw tcsaw and baw wafers in richardson texas apopka florida greensboro north carolina and hillsboro oregon in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we acquired an additional wafer fabrication facility in farmers branch texas which we currently plan to use to expand our baw filter capacity we also use multiple siliconbased process technologies including soi sige and cmos we outsource all silicon manufacturing to leading silicon foundries located throughout the world we have a global supply chain and ship millions of units per day 

we have our own flip chip and waferlevel packaging “wlp” technologies and also use external suppliers for these and other packaging technologies in flip chip packages the electrical connections are created directly on the surface of the die which eliminates wirebonds so the die may be attached directly to a substrate or leadframe this type of technology provides a higher density interconnection than wirebonded die and enables smaller form factors with improved thermal and electrical performance we use wlp technologies for our saw tcsaw and baw filter products 

once semiconductor wafers are manufactured they are singulated or separated into individual units called die prior to singulation of wafers into die we regularly conduct wafer level tests which could include electrical validation rf testing through the designed frequency bands as well as visual inspection for module products the next step is assembly during assembly the die and other components are placed on highdensity interconnect substrates to provide connectivity between the die and the components this populated substrate is formed into a microelectronic package next the products are tested for rf performance and prepared for shipment through a tape and reel process we primarily use internal assembly facilities in the united states china costa rica and germany and we also utilize external suppliers we also manufacture large volumes of wlp die and discrete filters that our customers directly assemble into their products 

manufacturing yields can vary significantly between products based on a number of factors including product complexity and the maturity of our manufacturing processes to maximize wafer yields and quality we test products multiple times maintain continuous reliability monitoring and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the production flow 

our internal manufacturing facilities require a high level of fixed costs consisting primarily of occupancy costs maintenance repair equipment depreciation and fixed labor costs related to manufacturing and process engineering 

ics and filter products are highly complex and sensitive to contaminants and semiconductor fabrication requires highly controlled clean environments wafers can be rejected or die on a wafer can be found to be nonfunctional as a result of minute impurities variances in the fabrication process or defects in the masks used to transfer circuits onto the wafers 

our manufacturing facilities worldwide are certified to the iso 9001 quality standard and select locations are certified to additional automotive ts16949 aerospace as9100 and environmental iso 14001 standards these stringent standards are audited and certified by thirdparty auditors in addition to our continuous internal selfaudits the iso 9001 standard is based on a number of quality management principles including a strong customer focus the motivation of top management the process approach and continual improvement isots16949 is the highest international quality standard for the global automotive industry and incorporates iso technical specifications that are more stringent than iso 9001 quality management systems requirements as9100 is the standardized quality management system for the aerospace industry iso 14001 is an internationally agreed upon standard for an environmental management system we require that all of our key vendors and suppliers be compliant with these standards as applicable 

raw materials 

we purchase numerous raw materials passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing processes for our gaas and gan manufacturing operations we use several raw materials including gaas wafers and gan on silicon carbide wafers for our acoustic filter manufacturing operations we use several raw materials including wafer starting materials made from quartz silicon lithium niobate or lithium tantalite as well as ceramic or metal packages relatively few companies produce these materials we are leading the industry in developing saw filters using sixinch lithium niobate wafers and we have qualified more than one source for this wafer starting material for all of our saw operations we utilize multiple qualified wafer and mask set vendors our most significant suppliers of ceramic surface mount packages are based in japan 

for our siliconbased integrated circuits we use thirdparty foundries high demand for soi wafers for our switch products has led to supply constraints in the past and we have addressed this by qualifying new silicon foundries and obtaining supply commitments from existing silicon suppliers 

our manufacturing strategy includes a balance of internal and external sites primarily for assembly operations which helps reduce costs provides flexibility of supply and minimizes the risk of supply disruption we routinely qualify multiple sources of supply and manufacturing sites to reduce the risk of supply interruptions or price increases and closely monitor suppliers’ key performance indicators our suppliers and our manufacturing sites are geographically diversified with our largest volume sources distributed throughout southern and eastern asia we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing needs 

customers 

we design develop manufacture and market products for leading us and international oems and odms we also collaborate with leading baseband reference design partners located primarily in the us and china 

we provided our products to our largest end customer apple inc apple through sales to multiple contract manufacturers which in the aggregate accounted for 34  37  and 32  of total revenue in fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively huawei technologies co ltd huawei accounted for 11  12  and 7  of our total revenue in fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively samsung electronics co ltd accounted for 7  7  and 14  of our total revenue in fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively these customers primarily purchase cellular rf and wifi solutions offered by our mp segment for a variety of mobile devices including smartphones notebook computers wearables tablets and cellularbased applications for the iot in fiscal 2017  huawei was the largest customer for our idp segment primarily purchasing solutions for base stations telecom transport and wifienabled cpe applications 

some of our sales to overseas customers are made under export licenses that must be obtained from the us department of commerce 

information about revenue including segment revenue operating profit or loss and total assets is presented in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

sales and marketing 

we sell our products worldwide directly to customers as well as through a network of domestic and foreign sales representative firms and distributors we select our domestic and foreign sales representatives based on technical skills and sales experience the presence of complementary product lines and the customer base served we provide ongoing training to our internal and external sales representatives and distributors to keep them educated about our products we maintain an internal sales and marketing organization that is responsible for key account management application engineering support for customers sales and advertising literature and technical presentations for industry conferences our sales and customer support centers are located near our customers throughout the world 

our web site contains extensive product information and we publish a comprehensive product selection guide annually our global team of application engineers interacts with customers during all stages of design and production maintains regular contact with customer engineers provides product application notes and engineering data and assists in the resolution of technical problems we maintain close relationships with our customers and platform providers and provide them strong technical support to help anticipate future product needs and enhance their customer experience 

research and development 

we maintain a high level of investment in research and development rd to develop the advanced technologies and products necessary to lead in the markets we serve our rd activities focus primarily on large competitive design win opportunities for major programs at key customers which typically requires us to improve the yearoveryear functional density performance size and cost of our products we also devote significant rd resources for targeted development of new products for general release to various markets our rd efforts require us to focus on both continuous improvement in our processes for design and manufacture as well as innovation in fundamental areas like materials simulation and modeling circuit design device packaging and test 

we have developed several generations of gaas gan baw and saw process technologies that we manufacture internally we invest in these technologies to improve device performance reduce die size and reduce manufacturing costs we also help develop and qualify technologies made by key suppliers including soi for switches and rf signal conditioning solutions sige and inp for amplifiers and cmos for power management devices and soc solutions we combine these external technologies with our proprietary design methods intellectual property and other expertise to improve performance increase integration and reduce the size and cost of our products 

we invest in gan process technologies and continue to develop and release new ganbased products to exploit gan’s performance advantages the inherent wide band gap high electron mobility and high breakdown voltage characteristics of gan semiconductor devices offer significant performance advantages versus competing technologies 

we develop and qualify advanced packaging technologies to allow us to eliminate wire bonds reduce component size and height improve performance and reduce package costs we are also investing in large scale module assembly and test capabilities to bring these technologies to market in very high volumes 

in fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  we incurred approximately 4708 million  4488 million  and 2575 million  respectively in rd expenses we expect to continue to spend substantial funds on rd in support of our growth and product diversification 

competition 

we operate in a competitive industry characterized by rapid advances in technology and new product introductions our customers’ product life cycles are often short and our competitiveness depends on our ability to improve our products and processes faster than our competitors anticipate changing customer requirements and successfully develop and launch new products while reducing our costs our competitiveness is also affected by the quality of our customer service and technical support and our ability to design customized products that address each customer’s particular requirements within their cost limitations the selection process for our products to be included in our customers’ products is highly competitive and our customers provide no guarantees that our products will be included in the next generation of products introduced 

we compete primarily with the following companies analog devices inc broadcom limited macom technology solutions inc murata manufacturing co ltd northrop grumman corporation qualcomm technologies inc skyworks solutions inc and sumitomo electric device innovations 

many of our current and potential competitors have entrenched market positions and customer relationships established patents and other intellectual property and substantial technological capabilities in some cases our competitors are also our customers or suppliers additionally many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing and marketing resources than we do which may allow them to implement new technologies and develop new products more quickly than we can 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets is important to our business and we actively seek opportunities to leverage our intellectual property portfolio to promote our business interests we also actively seek to monitor and protect our global intellectual property rights and to deter unauthorized use of our intellectual property and other assets such efforts can be difficult because of the absence of consistent international standards and laws moreover we respect the intellectual property rights of others and have implemented policies and procedures to mitigate the risk of infringing or misappropriating third party intellectual property 

patent applications are filed within the us and in other countries where we have a market presence on occasion some applications do not mature into patents for various reasons including rejections based on prior art in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws we have more than 1200 patents that expire from 2017 to 2037 we also continue to acquire patents through acquisitions or direct prosecution efforts and engage in licensing transactions to secure the right to practice third parties’ patents in view of our rapid innovation and product development and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes there is no guarantee that our products will not be obsolete before the related patents expire or are granted however we believe the duration and scope of our most relevant patents are sufficient to support our business which as a whole is not significantly dependent on any particular patent or other intellectual property right as we expand our products and offerings we also seek to expand our patent prosecution efforts to cover such products 

we periodically register federal trademarks service marks and trade names that distinguish our product brand names in the market we also monitor these marks for their proper and intended use additionally we rely on nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our interest in confidential and proprietary information that gives us a competitive advantage including business strategies unpatented inventions designs and process technology such information is closely monitored and made available only to those employees whose responsibilities require access to the information 

backlog 

our sales are the result of standard purchase orders or specific agreements with customers we maintain qorvoowned finished goods inventory at certain customers’ “hub” locations and do not recognize revenue until our customers draw down the inventory at these hubs our customers’ projections of consumption of hub inventory and quantities on purchase orders as well as the shipment schedules are frequently revised within agreedupon lead times to reflect changes in the customers’ needs because industry practice allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment and with little or no penalty we believe that backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels 

employees 

on april 1 2017  we had more than 8600  employees we believe that our future prospects will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain skilled employees competition for skilled personnel is intense and the number of persons with relevant experience particularly in rf engineering product design and technical marketing is limited none of our us employees are represented by a labor union a number of our employees in germany less than 5 of our global workforce as of april 1 2017  are represented by internal works councils we have never experienced any work stoppage and we believe that our current employee relations are good 

geographic financial summary 

a summary of our operations by geographic area is as follows in thousands 



sales for geographic disclosure purposes are based on the “sold to” address of the customer the “sold to” address is not always an accurate representation of the location of final consumption of our products of our total revenue for fiscal 2017  approximately 62   18660 million  was attributable to customers in china and 13   3984 million  was attributable to customers in taiwan of our total revenue for fiscal years 2016  and 2015  approximately 61   16010 million  and 49   8410 million  respectively was attributable to customers in china and 14   3651 million  and 19   3325 million  respectively was attributable to customers in taiwan 

for financial information regarding our operations by geographic area see note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report 

for a summary of certain risks associated with our foreign operations see item 1a “risk factors” 

  

environmental matters 

by virtue of operating our wafer fabrication facilities we are subject to a variety of extensive and changing domestic and international federal state and local governmental laws regulations and ordinances related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in the manufacturing process we provide our own manufacturing waste water treatment and disposal for most of our manufacturing facilities and we have contracted for the disposal of hazardous waste state agencies require us to report usage of environmentally hazardous materials and we have retained appropriate personnel to help ensure compliance with all applicable environmental regulations we believe that costs arising from existing environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

we are an iso 14001 certified manufacturer with a comprehensive environmental management system “ems” in place in order to help ensure control of the environmental aspects of the manufacturing process our ems mandates compliance and establishes appropriate checks and balances to minimize the potential for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations 

we actively monitor the hazardous materials that are used in the manufacture assembly and testing of our products particularly materials that are retained in the final product we have developed specific restrictions on the content of certain hazardous materials in our products as well as those of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers and subcontractors this helps to ensure that our products are compliant with the requirements of the markets into which the products will be sold for example our products are compliant with the european union rohs directive 201165eu on the restriction of use of hazardous substances which prohibits the sale in the european union market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing certain families of substances above a specified threshold 

we do not currently anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in fiscal 2018

 item 1a risk factors 

our operating results fluctuate 

our revenue earnings margins and other operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future if demand for our products fluctuates as a result of economic conditions or for other reasons our revenue and profitability could be impacted our future operating results will depend on many factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is likely that our future operating results could be adversely affected by one or more of the factors set forth above or other similar factors if our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market analysts or our investors our stock price may decline 

our operating results are substantially dependent on development of new products and achieving design wins as our industry’s technology changes rapidly 

our markets are characterized by the frequent introduction of new products in response to evolving product and process technologies and consumer demand for greater functionality lower costs smaller products and better performance historically the average selling prices of many of our products have decreased over the products’ lives and we have experienced and expect to experience in the future some product design obsolescence to offset these average selling price decreases and to meet our customers’ demands for reductions in cost and improvements in technology we must achieve yield improvements and other cost reductions for existing products and introduce new products that are competitive and can be manufactured at lower costs or that command higher prices based on superior performance 

our future success is dependent on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely and costeffective manner and secure production orders from our customers the development of new products is a highly complex process and we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products at times in the past our successful product development depends on a number of factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to design and introduce new products in a timely or costefficient manner and our new products may fail to meet market or customer requirements most major product design opportunities that we pursue involve multiple competitors and we could lose a new product design opportunity to a competitor that offers a lower cost or equal or superior performing products if we are unsuccessful in achieving design wins against our competitors our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected even when a design win is achieved our success is not assured design wins may require significant expenditures by us and typically precede volume revenue by six to nine months or more many customers seek a second source for all major components in their devices which can significantly reduce the revenue obtained from a design win the actual value of a design win to us will ultimately depend on the commercial success of our customers’ products 

we depend on a few large customers for a substantial portion of our revenue 

a substantial portion of our mp revenue comes from large purchases by a small number of customers our future operating results depend on both the success of our largest customers and on our success in diversifying our products and customer base 

we typically manufacture custom products on an exclusive basis for individual customers for a negotiated period of time increasingly the largest cellular handset oems are releasing fewer new phone models on an annual basis which heightens the importance of achieving design wins for these larger opportunities while the rewards for a design win are financially greater competition for these projects is intense the concentration of our revenue with a relatively small number of customers makes us particularly dependent on factors affecting those customers for example if demand for their products decreases they may reduce their purchases of or stop purchasing our products and our operating results would suffer most of our customers can cease incorporating our products into their products with little notice to us and with little or no penalty the loss of a large customer and failure to add new customers to replace lost revenue would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have entered into a supply arrangement with apple to supply them with a module that combines multiple highorder multiplexers with pas switches and lnas for their 2018 smartphones which requires a substantial rd investment by us and obligates us to supply product to them on specified terms and build and maintain production capacity to meet these requirements meeting the technical and other requirements for this project is not assured 

  

we have a master supply agreement with apple under which we provide them with various rf components and modules for their smartphones and other mobile devices we periodically enter into statements of work under this agreement under which we agree with apple on the terms of development and supply of specific rf components and modules we have entered into a statement of work with apple under which we have agreed to supply a module that combines multiple highorder multiplexers with pas switches and lnas for certain smartphones scheduled to launch in 2018 and to secure maintain and allocate to them sufficient manufacturing capacity to make this product we have also agreed to pricing based on the indicated volume of product that would be purchased by apple under the arrangement in consideration for this agreement apple intends but is not required to source a specified range of its needs for this module from us provided that we are able to meet certain development supply quality and other commitments this module is highly integrated and technically complex the development process is ongoing and meeting apple’s engineering specifications is not assured we have already invested and expect to continue to invest substantial resources and capital to this development project and to build the required baw filter manufacturing capacity if we fail to meet apple’s technical performance or other requirements our product will not be selected and we will not generate any revenue from this project even if our development efforts are successful we may not generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we are forecasting from this arrangement like our work on other major customdesign programs our ability to realize a profit under this arrangement will be subject to the level of end customer demand for the smartphones into which our product is installed and to the costs of maintaining facilities and manufacturing capacity and obtaining the materials and services required for us to perform under the arrangement 

we face risks of a loss of revenue if contracts with the us government or defense and aerospace contractors are canceled or delayed or if defense spending is reduced 

we receive a portion of our revenue from the us government and from prime contractors on us governmentsponsored programs principally for defense and aerospace applications these programs are subject to delays or cancellation further spending on defense and aerospace contracts can vary significantly depending on funding from the us government we believe our government and defense and aerospace contracts have been negatively affected in the past by external factors such as sequestration and political pressure to reduce federal defense spending reductions in defense and aerospace funding or the loss of a significant defense and aerospace program or contract would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we depend heavily on third parties 

we purchase numerous component parts substrates and siliconbased products from external suppliers we also utilize thirdparty suppliers for numerous services including die processing wafer bumping test and tape and reel the use of external suppliers involves a number of risks including the possibility of material disruptions in the supply of key components and the lack of control over delivery schedules capacity constraints manufacturing yields product quality and fabrication costs 

although our key suppliers commit to us to be compliant with applicable iso 9001 andor ts16949 quality standards we have experienced quality and reliability issues in the past with certain suppliers quality or reliability issues in our supply chain could negatively affect our products our reputation and our results of operations 

we face risks related to sales through distributors   

we sell a significant portion of our products through third party distributors we depend on these distributors to help us create end customer demand provide technical support and other valueadded services to customers fill customer orders and stock our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products may be limited because our end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor due to advantages in the incumbent distributors’ technical support and favorable business terms related to payments discounts and stocking of 

acceptable inventory levels using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks including competitive pressure concentration credit risk and compliance risks other third parties may use one of our distributors to sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to the distributors to focus them on the sale of our products our distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by our distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

we face risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing facilities 

we operate wafer fabrication facilities in texas florida north carolina and oregon we currently use several international and domestic assembly suppliers as well as internal assembly facilities in the us china costa rica the philippines and germany to assemble and test our products we currently have our own test and tape and reel facilities located in the us china costa rica and the philippines and we also utilize contract suppliers and partners in asia to test our products 

a number of factors will affect the future success of our facilities including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters telecommunications failures power or water shortages extreme weather conditions public health issues military actions acts of terrorism political or regulatory issues and other manmade disasters or catastrophic events we carry commercial property damage and business interruption insurance against various risks with limits we deem adequate for reimbursement for damage to our fixed assets and resulting disruption of our operations however the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses any disruptions from these events could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations and could also have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results to the 

extent that losses exceed insurance recoveries and to the extent that such disruptions adversely impact our relationships with our customers 

if we experience poor manufacturing yields our operating results may suffer 

our products have unique designs and are fabricated using multiple semiconductor process technologies that are highly complex in many cases our products are assembled in customized packages many of our products consist of multiple components in a single module and feature enhanced levels of integration and complexity our customers insist that our products be designed to meet their exact specifications for quality performance and reliability our manufacturing yield is a combination of yields across the entire supply chain including wafer fabrication assembly and test yields defects in a single component in an assembled module product can impact the yield for the entire module which means the adverse economic impacts of an individual defect can be multiplied many times over if we fail to discover the defect before the module is assembled due to the complexity of our products we periodically experience difficulties in achieving acceptable yields and other quality issues particularly with respect to new products 

our customers test our products once they have been assembled into their products the number of usable products that result from our production process can fluctuate as a result of many factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we constantly seek to improve our manufacturing yields typically for a given level of sales when our yields improve our gross margins improve and when our yields decrease our unit costs are higher our margins are lower and our operating results are adversely affected 

costs of product defects and deviations from required specifications could include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these costs could be significant and could reduce our gross margins our reputation with customers also could be damaged as a result of product defects and quality issues and product demand could be reduced which could harm our business and financial results 

we are subject to increased inventory risks and costs because we build our products based on forecasts provided by customers before receiving purchase orders for the products 

in order to ensure availability of our products for some of our largest customers we start manufacturing certain products in advance of receiving purchase orders based on forecasts provided by these customers however these forecasts do not represent binding purchase commitments and we do not recognize sales for these products until they are shipped to or consumed by the customer as a result we incur significant inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales because demand for our products may not materialize manufacturing based on forecasts subjects us to heightened risks of higher inventory carrying costs increased obsolescence and higher operating costs these inventory risks are exacerbated when our customers purchase indirectly through contract manufacturers or hold component inventory levels greater than their consumption rate because this reduces our visibility regarding the customers’ accumulated levels of inventory if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to writeoff inventory which would have a negative impact on our gross margin and other operating results 

we sell certain of our products based on reference designs of platform providers and our inability to effectively manage or maintain our evolving relationships with these companies may have an adverse effect on our business 

platform providers are typically large companies that provide system reference designs for oems and odms that include the platform provider’s baseband and other complementary products a platform provider may own or control ip that gives it a strong market position for its baseband products for certain air interface standards which provides it with significant influence and control over sales of rf products for these standards platform providers historically looked to us and our competitors to provide rf products to their customers as part of the overall system design and we competed with other rf companies to have our products included in the platform provider’s system reference design this market dynamic has evolved in recent years as platform providers have worked to develop more fully integrated solutions that include their own rf technologies and components 

platform providers may be in a different business from ours or we may be their customer or direct competitor accordingly we must balance our interest in obtaining new business with competitive and other factors because platform providers control the overall system reference design if they offer competitive rf technologies or their own rf solutions as a part of their reference design and exclude our products from the design we are at a distinct competitive disadvantage with oems and odms that are seeking a turnkey design solution even if our products offer superior performance this requires us to work more closely with oems and odms to secure the design of our products in their handsets and other devices 

our relationships with platform providers are complex and evolving and the inability to effectively manage or maintain these relationships could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to risks from international sales and operations 

we operate globally with sales offices and rd activities as well as manufacturing assembly and testing facilities in multiple countries as a result we are subject to regulatory geopolitical and other risks associated with doing business outside the us including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sales to customers located outside the us accounted for approximately 85  of our revenue in fiscal 2017  of which approximately 62  and 13  were attributable to sales to customers located in china and taiwan respectively we expect that revenue from international sales to china and other markets will continue to be a significant part of our total revenue any weakness in the chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for consumer products that contain our products which could materially and adversely affect our business 

the majority of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars which causes our products to become less pricecompetitive in countries with currencies that are low or are declining in value against the us dollar in addition the majority of our assembly test and tape and reel vendors are located in asia and we do the majority of our business with our foreign assemblers in us dollars we cannot be sure that our international customers and manufacturing suppliers will continue to accept orders denominated in us dollars 

economic regulation in china could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we have a significant portion of our assembly and testing capacity in china in recent years the chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation in response to these factors the chinese government has from time to time adopted measures to regulate growth and contain inflation including measures designed to restrict credit or to control prices such actions in the future as well as other changes in chinese laws and regulations could increase the cost of doing business in china or decrease the demand for our products in china which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we operate in a very competitive industry and must continue to implement innovative technologies 

we compete with several companies primarily engaged in the business of designing manufacturing and selling rf solutions as well as suppliers of discrete integrated circuits and modules in addition to our direct competitors some of our largest customers and leading platform partners also compete with us to some extent by designing and manufacturing their own products increased competition from any source could adversely affect our operating results through lower prices for our products reduced demand for our products losses of existing design slots with key customers and a corresponding reduction in our ability to recover development engineering and manufacturing costs 

many of our existing and potential competitors have entrenched market positions historical affiliations with oems considerable internal manufacturing capacity established ip rights and substantial technological capabilities the semiconductor industry has experienced increased industry consolidation over the last several years a trend we expect to continue many of our existing and potential competitors may have greater financial technical manufacturing or marketing resources than we do we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully with our competitors 

industry overcapacity could cause us to underutilize our manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

it is difficult to predict future demand for our products which makes it difficult to estimate future requirements for production capacity capacity expansion projects have long lead times and require capital commitments based on forecasted product trends and demand well in advance of production orders from customers in recent years we have made significant capital investments to expand our baw saw and tcsaw filter capacity to address forecasted future demand patterns 

in the past capacity additions by us and our competitors sometimes exceeded demand requirements leading to oversupply situations fluctuations in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products lead to overcapacity and contribute to cyclicality in the semiconductor market 

as many of our manufacturing costs are fixed these costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues experienced during periods in which we underutilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of overcapacity if the demand for our products is not consistent with our expectations underutilization of our manufacturing facilities may have a material adverse effect on average selling prices our gross margin and other operating results 

we may not be able to borrow funds under our credit facility or secure future financing 

we maintain a fiveyear senior credit facility with bank of america na as administrative agent and a lender and a syndicate of other lenders the “credit agreement” the credit agreement includes a 3000 million  revolving credit facility which includes a 250 million  sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a 100 million  sublimit for swing line loans we may request at any time and from time to time that the revolving credit facility be increased by an amount not to exceed 1500 million  the revolving credit facility is available to finance working capital capital expenditures and for other corporate purposes this facility contains various conditions covenants and representations with which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds we cannot assure that we will be in compliance with these conditions covenants and representations in the future when we may need to borrow funds under this facility 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt including our senior notes or to fund capital expenditures and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our debt obligations and financing requirements which may not be successful or on terms favorable to us 

in november 2015 we issued 4500 million  aggregate principal amount of 675  senior notes due 2023 the 2023 notes and 5500 million  aggregate principal amount of 700  senior notes due 2025 the 2025 notes and together with the 2023 notes the “notes” in september 2016 we completed an exchange offer in which all of the 2023 notes and substantially all of the 2025 notes were exchanged for new notes that have been registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended the securities act our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations including the notes and to fund working capital planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts and any strategic alliances or acquisitions we may make in the future depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we cannot be sure that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our debt including the notes if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may face liquidity issues and be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt including the notes these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service and other obligations additionally the agreements governing our credit agreement and the indenture governing the notes limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition as a result we may not be allowed under these documents to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy our debt service obligations further we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity and we cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the agreements and instruments governing our debt impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility 

the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these covenants could have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete in addition the credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants operating results below current levels or other adverse factors including a significant increase in interest rates could result in our being unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in our revolving credit facility if we violate covenants under the credit agreement and are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders our debt under our revolving credit facility would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders because of crossdefault provisions in the agreements and instruments governing our debt a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under and the acceleration of our other debt if our debt is accelerated we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if we are able to obtain new financing it may not be on commercially reasonable terms on terms that are acceptable to us or at all if our debt is in default for any reason our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions 

the price of our common stock may be volatile 

the price of our common stock which is traded on the nasdaq global select market has been and may continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in addition the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

we cannot assure you that the price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future in addition the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to our performance 

we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders’ ownership and cause us to incur debt and assume contingent liabilities 

as part of our business strategy we expect to continue to review potential acquisitions that could complement our current product offerings augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth or margin improvement opportunities in the event of future acquisitions of businesses products or technologies we could issue equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership incur substantial debt or other financial obligations or assume contingent liabilities such actions could harm our results of operations or the price of our common stock acquisitions also entail numerous other risks that could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate key employees and our failure to do so could harm our business and our results of operations 

in order to compete effectively we must 

 

 

 

 

our future operating results and success depend on keeping key technical personnel and management and expanding our sales and marketing rd and administrative support we do not have employment agreements with the vast majority of our employees we must also continue to attract qualified personnel the competition for qualified personnel is intense and the number of people with experience particularly in rf engineering integrated circuit and filter design and technical marketing and support is limited in addition immigration laws may limit the pool of available talent we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain skilled personnel in the future which could harm our business and our results of operations 

we rely on our intellectual property portfolio and may not be able to successfully protect against the use of our intellectual property by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that patents will be issued in all countries where our products can be sold further we cannot be certain that any claims allowed from pending applications will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection against our competitors our competitors may also be able to design around our patents 

the laws of some countries in which our products are developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws this increases the possibility of piracy of our technology and products although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology additionally our competitors may be able to independently develop noninfringing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours 

we may need to engage in legal actions to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights generally intellectual property litigation is both expensive and unpredictable our involvement in intellectual property litigation could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights 

our operating results may be adversely affected if third parties were to assert claims that our products infringed their patent copyright or other intellectual property rights such assertions could lead to expensive and unpredictable litigation diverting the attention of management and technical personnel an unsuccessful result in any such litigation could have adverse effects on our business which may include injunctions exclusion orders and royalty payments to third parties in addition if one of our customers or another supplier to one of our customers were found to be infringing on thirdparty intellectual property rights such finding could adversely affect the demand for our products 

security breaches and other similar disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

we rely on trade secrets technical knowhow and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities we try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants strategic partners and other parties we also restrict access to our proprietary information 

despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our proprietary information without our authorization additionally current departing or former employees or third parties could attempt to improperly use or access our computer systems and networks to misappropriate our proprietary information or otherwise interrupt our business like others we are also potentially subject to significant system or network disruptions including new system implementations computer viruses facility access issues and energy blackouts 

from time to time we have experienced attacks on our computer systems by unauthorized outside parties however we do not believe that such attacks have resulted in any material damage to our customers or us because the techniques used by computer hackers and others to access or sabotage networks constantly evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate counter or ameliorate all of these techniques as a result our technologies processes and customer information may be misappropriated and the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted any loss of such information could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence in the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures or cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the incident we routinely implement improvements to our network security safeguards and we are devoting increasing resources to the security of our information technology systems we cannot however assure that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future cyberattack or network disruptions 

we also rely on thirdparty service providers to protect our proprietary information third party service providers include foundries assembly and test contractors distributors and other vendors that have access to our sensitive data these providers should have safeguards in place to protect our data failure of these parties to properly safeguard our data could also result in security breaches and loss of proprietary information 

the costs related to cyber or other security threats or computer systems disruptions typically would not be fully insured or indemnified by others occurrence of any of the events described above could result in loss of competitive advantages derived from our rd efforts or our ip moreover these events may result in the early obsolescence of our products adversely affect our internal operations and reputation or degrade our financial results and stock price 

we are subject to warranty claims product recalls and product liability 

from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expense we may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims conversely in some cases amounts we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claims and may need to be reversed 

product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims or we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing one of our devices in such an event we may incur significant costs and expenses including among others replacement costs contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions relating to product quality issues the potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant and in some cases including in agreements with some of our largest customers are potentially unlimited any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from the relevant products costs payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to stringent environmental health and safety regulations 

we are subject to a broad array of united states and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations include those related to the use transportation storage handling emission discharge and recycling or disposal of hazardous materials used in our manufacturing assembly and testing processes our failure to comply with any of these existing or future laws or regulations could result in 

 

 

 

 

 

existing and future environmental laws and regulations could also impact our product designs and limit or restrict the materials or components that are included in our products in addition many of our largest customers require us to comply with corporate social responsibility or csr policies which often include employment health safety environmental and other requirements that exceed applicable legal requirements compliance with these policies increases our operating expenses and noncompliance can adversely affect customer relationships and harm our business 

compliance with regulations regarding the use of “conflict minerals” could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

regulations in the united states currently require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products referred to as conflict minerals originated in the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries or were from recycled or scrap sources the verification and reporting requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals that are used in the manufacture of our products we have incurred costs and expect to incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements additionally we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement we may also face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently make any required determination that the metals used in our products are conflict free 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying deterring preventing or rendering more difficult a change in control of qorvo that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests these provisions include 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the general corporation law of the state of delaware contains provisions that regulate “business combinations” between corporations and interested stockholders who own 15 or more of the corporation’s voting stock except under certain circumstances these provisions could also discourage potential acquisition proposals and delay or prevent a change in control 

these provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit of any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context and may also make it more difficult for a third party to replace directors on our board of directors further the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 

our operating results could vary as a result of the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see “ critical accounting policies and estimates ” in part ii item 7 of this report such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments that could significantly affect our results of operations 

decisions we make about the scope of our future operations could affect our future financial results 

changes in the business environment could lead us to decide to change the scope of operations of our business which could result in restructuring and asset impairment charges the amount and timing of such charges can be difficult to predict factors that contribute to the amount and timing of such charges include 

 

 

 

 

changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in the us china singapore germany and numerous other foreign taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuations as it is impacted by a number of factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

changes in the favorable tax status of our subsidiaries in costa rica and singapore would have an adverse impact on our operating results 

our subsidiaries in costa rica and singapore have been granted tax holidays that effectively minimize our tax expense and that are expected to be effective through march 2024 and december 2021 respectively in their efforts to deal with budget deficits governments around the world are focusing on increasing tax revenues through increased audits and potentially increased tax rates for corporations as part of this effort governments continue to review their policies on granting tax holidays in february 2017 singapore enacted legislation that will exclude from our existing development and expansion incentive grant the benefit of the reduced tax rate for intellectual property income earned after june 30 2021 future changes in the status of either tax holiday could have a negative effect on our net income in future years

fiscal 2017  management summary 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

results of operations 

consolidated 

the following table presents a summary of our results of operations for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  



revenue 

our overall revenue increased 4218 million  or 162  in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to higher demand for our cellular rf solutions in support of marquee smartphones and customers based in china and higher sales of our wireless infrastructure defense and aerospace and wifi products 

our overall revenue increased 8998 million  or 526  in fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily because fiscal 2015  included only three months of triquint revenue 

we provided our products to our largest end customer apple through sales to multiple contract manufacturers which in the aggregate accounted for 34  37  and 32  of total revenue in fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively huawei accounted for approximately 11  12  and 7  of our total revenue in fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively samsung accounted for approximately 7  7  and 14  of our total revenue in fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively these customers primarily purchase cellular rf and wifi solutions offered by our mp segment for a variety of mobile devices including smartphones notebook computers wearables tablets and cellularbased applications for the iot in fiscal 2017  huawei was the largest customer for our idp segment primarily purchasing solutions for base stations telecom transport and wifienabled customer premise equipment applications 

international shipments amounted to 25655 million  in fiscal 2017  approximately 85  of revenue compared to 23044 million  in fiscal 2016  approximately 88  of revenue and 13952 million  in fiscal 2015  approximately 82  of revenue shipments to asia totaled 24411 million  in fiscal 2017  approximately 81  of revenue compared to 21621 million  in fiscal 2016  approximately 83  of revenue and 12822 million  in fiscal 2015  approximately 75  of revenue we expect our international and asia shipments will remain relatively stable at these historical levels 

gross margin 

our overall gross margin for fiscal 2017  was 374  as compared to 402  in fiscal 2016  gross margin was adversely impacted in fiscal 2017  by an unfavorable change in product mix towards lower margin lowband pad modules product cost reductions lagging normal average selling price erosion lower factory utilization and unfavorable inventory adjustments primarily due to lower than expected manufacturing and assembly yields on the lowband pad modules in the second quarter of fiscal 2017  the lower yield was associated with the device packaging not device functionality however the impact was significant because the issue was identified late in the production process these adverse factors were partially offset by lower intangible amortization stockbased compensation and other costs related to the business combination in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  

our overall gross margin for fiscal 2016  was 402  as compared to 403  in fiscal 2015  this slight decrease was primarily due to higher cash and noncash expenses related to the business combination including intangible amortization and stockbased compensation and average selling price erosion this decrease was offset by increased revenue and profitability resulting from the addition of triquints operations as well as the synergies created from the business combination a favorable change in product mix towards higher margin products and manufacturing and sourcingrelated cost reductions 

  

operating expenses   

research and development   

in fiscal 2017  rd spending increased 221 million  or 49  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily driven by costs associated with the design and development of highperformance filter based products and ganbased technologies and products the increased rd expense was partially offset by lower stockbased compensation expense 

in fiscal 2016  rd spending increased 1913 million  or 743  as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily due to the inclusion of triquint rd expense for a full fiscal year fiscal 2015 included only three months of triquint expenses and increases in headcount and product development costs related to new mobile products 

selling general and administrative   

in fiscal 2017  selling general and administrative expense increased 115 million  or 22  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to higher personnel related costs partially offset by lower stockbased compensation expense 

in fiscal 2016  selling general and administrative expense increased 2842 million  or 1137  as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily due to marketingrelated intangible asset amortization resulting from the business combination and the addition of triquint selling general and administrative expense for a full fiscal year fiscal 2015 included only three months of triquint expenses 

other operating expense 

in fiscal 2017  other operating expense was 310 million  compared to 547 million  for fiscal 2016  in fiscal 2017  we recorded integration costs of 169 million  and restructuring costs of 20 million  associated with the business combination as well as 97 million  of startup costs related to new processes and operations in both existing and new facilities in fiscal 2016  we recorded integration costs of 265 million  and restructuring costs of 101 million  including stockbased compensation associated with the business combination as well as 141 million  of startup costs related to new processes and operations in both existing and new facilities 

in fiscal 2015  other operating expense was 595 million  including acquisition costs of 122 million  integration costs of 313 million  and restructuring costs of 109 million  associated with the business combination 

operating income 

our overall operating income was 881 million  for fiscal 2017  as compared to 120 million  for fiscal 2016  this increase was primarily due to higher gross profit from higher revenue and lower intangible amortization stockbased compensation and other costs related to the business combination partially offset by lower gross margin gross margin was adversely impacted primarily due to an unfavorable change in product mix towards lower margin lowband pad modules product cost reductions lagging normal average selling price erosion lower factory utilization and unfavorable inventory adjustments primarily due to lower than expected manufacturing and assembly yields on the lowband pad modules in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 

our overall operating income was 120 million  for fiscal 2016  as compared to 1225 million  for fiscal 2015  this decrease was primarily due to higher intangible amortization stockbased compensation and other costs related to the business combination and average selling price erosion partially offset by increased revenue and profitability resulting from the addition of triquints operations as well as the synergies created from the business combination a favorable change in product mix towards higher margin products and manufacturing and sourcingrelated cost reductions 

segment product revenue operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue 

mobile products 



mp revenue increased 3007 million  or 144  in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to higher demand for our cellular rf solutions in support of marquee smartphones and customers based in china 

the decrease in mp operating income as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily due to lower gross margin gross margin was adversely impacted in fiscal 2017  by an unfavorable change in product mix towards lower margin lowband pad modules product cost reductions lagging normal average selling price erosion lower factory utilization and unfavorable inventory adjustments primarily due to lower than expected manufacturing assembly yields on the lowband pad modules in the second quarter of fiscal 2017  the lower yield was associated with the device packaging not device functionality however the impact was significant because the issue was identified late in the production process 

mp revenue increased 6883 million  or 493  in fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily because fiscal 2015 included only three months of triquint revenue 

the decrease in mp operating income as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  was primarily due to increased expenses related to the development of new mobile products partially offset by higher 

gross margins resulting from a favorable change in product mix towards higher margin products and manufacturing and sourcingrelated cost reductions which were partially offset by average selling price erosion 

infrastructure and defense products 



idp revenue increased 1211 million  or 231  in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to higher sales of our wireless infrastructure defense and aerospace and wifi products 

idp operating income increased 442 million  or 408  in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  driven by higher gross profit from increased revenue favorable factory utilization and lower unfavorable inventory adjustments this increase in gross profit was partially offset by higher personnelrelated expenses 

idp revenue increased 2102 million  or 671  in fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily because fiscal 2015 included only three months of triquint revenue 

the decrease in idp operating income as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  was primarily due to lower gross margins resulting from decreased demand for wireless infrastructure products during the first half of fiscal 2016 the demand for wireless infrastructure products began to show signs of recovery in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and continued to improve in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 

see note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of segment operating income to the consolidated operating income for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  

other expense income and income taxes 



interest expense   

we recognized 699 million  and 258 million  of interest expense in fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively related to the 10 billion  of senior notes that were issued in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 interest expense in the preceding table for fiscal years 2017  and 2016  is net of capitalized interest of 136 million  and 52 million  respectively 

other expense income 

  

other expense in fiscal 2017  of approximately 31 million  was related primarily to a net loss from foreign currency the foreign currency loss was driven primarily by the appreciation of the us dollar against the renminbi as well as by the changes in the local currency denominated balance sheet accounts in fiscal 2016 we recognized net income primarily due to a gain from the sale of equity securities 

income tax expense benefit 

income tax expense for fiscal 2017  was 439 million  which was primarily comprised of tax expense related to domestic and international operations generating pretax book income and an increase in gross unrecognized tax 

benefits offset by tax benefits related to international operations generating pretax book losses and tax credits generated for fiscal 2017  this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 1606  

income tax expense for fiscal 2016  was 260 million  which was primarily comprised of tax expense related to international operations an increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits and a 251 million  increase in the valuation allowance against domestic state tax net operating loss and credit deferred tax assets and foreign net operating loss deferred tax assets offset by tax benefits arising from domestic operations and tax credits generated for fiscal 2016  this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 9080  

income tax benefit for fiscal 2015  was 751 million  which was primarily comprised of tax expense related to domestic and international operations offset by tax benefits from tax credits generated and 1358 million  related to a decrease in the valuation allowance against domestic deferred tax assets for fiscal 2015  this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 619  

a valuation allowance has been established against deferred tax assets in the taxing jurisdictions where based upon the positive and negative evidence available it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized realization is dependent upon generating future income in the taxing jurisdictions in which the operating loss carryovers credit carryovers depreciable tax basis and other tax deferred assets exist management reevaluates the ability to realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis as of the end of fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  the valuation allowance against domestic and foreign deferred tax assets was 331 million  347 million  and 138 million  respectively 

the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets decreased  by 16 million  in fiscal 2017  the decrease  was comprised of a 52 million  decrease in the valuation allowance for foreign deferred tax assets primarily resulting from the removal of the valuation allowance at a china subsidiary as management has determined it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized this was partially offset by a 28 million  increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for federal foreign tax credits state net operating losses and state tax credits and a 08 million  increase for other foreign net operating loss deferred tax assets at the end of fiscal 2017 a 08 million  valuation allowance remained against net deferred tax assets at other foreign subsidiaries and a 323 million  valuation allowance remained against domestic deferred tax assets as management has determined it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized effectively increasing the domestic net deferred tax liabilities 

during fiscal 2017 the china subsidiary which operates as a cost plus manufacturer for another qorvo subsidiary exited its startup operational phase and generated sufficient income to substantially offset the losses earned in prior years with the balance expected to be offset by income in the first half of fiscal 2018 as production at the assembly and test facility continues to increase 

the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets increased by 209 million  in fiscal 2016  the increase was comprised of a 202 million  increase in the valuation allowance for state deferred tax assets for net operating losses and tax credits a 50 million  increase in the valuation allowance for foreign net operating loss deferred tax assets and a 43 million  decrease in the valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset recorded in the initial purchase price accounting for the business combination the business combination adjustment related to a deferred tax asset that was recorded during fiscal 2015 in the initial purchase price accounting with a full valuation allowance but which deferred tax asset was determined in fiscal 2016 to not exist as of the acquisition date accordingly in fiscal 2016 that deferred tax asset was removed along with the offsetting deferred tax asset valuation allowance at the end of fiscal 2016 a 52 million  valuation allowance remained against foreign net deferred tax assets and a 295 million  valuation allowance remained against domestic deferred tax assets as management has determined it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized effectively increasing the domestic net deferred tax liabilities 

during fiscal 2016 north carolina enacted legislation to reduce the corporate income tax rate from 5  to 4  and phasein over a threeyear period a single sales factor apportionment methodology in addition the company underwent operational changes to leverage existing resources and capabilities of its singapore subsidiary and consolidate operations and responsibilities associated with its foreign manufacturing operations and foreign customers in that singapore subsidiary together these changes resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of future taxable income expected to be allocated to north carolina and other states in which the companys net operating loss and credit carryovers exist as a result it was no longer more likely than not that the deferred tax assets related to those state net operating loss and credit carryovers for which a valuation 

allowance is being provided will be realized before they expire the foreign net operating losses relate to the china subsidiary that owns an assembly and test facility that became operational during fiscal 2016 and which has incurred startup losses since inception 

the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets decreased  in fiscal 2015  by 1295 million  the decrease was comprised of 1357 million  for domestic deferred tax assets for which realization was determined to be more likely than not with the increase in domestic deferred tax liabilities related to domestic amortizable intangible assets arising in connection with the business combination and other changes in the net deferred tax assets for foreign subsidiaries during the fiscal year offset by an increase of 62 million  related to deferred tax assets acquired in the business combination which are not more likely than not of being realized at the end of fiscal 2015  a 02 million  valuation allowance remained against foreign net deferred tax assets and a 136 million  valuation allowance remained against domestic deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized effectively increasing the domestic net deferred tax liabilities 

as of april 1 2017  we had federal loss carryovers of approximately 2026 million  that expire in fiscal years 2020 to 2036 if unused and state losses of approximately 2093 million  that expire in fiscal years 2018 to 2036 if unused federal research credits of 1048 million  federal foreign tax credits of 50 million  and state credits of 574 million  may expire in fiscal years 2018 to 2037 2018 to 2027 and 2018 to 2032 respectively federal alternative minimum tax credits of 32 million  carry forward indefinitely foreign losses in china of approximately 33 million and in the netherlands of approximately 554 million expire in fiscal year 2021 and fiscal years 2018 to 2026 respectively included in the amounts above are certain net operating losses and other tax attribute assets acquired in conjunction with the greenpeak acquisition during the current fiscal year and acquisitions of sirenza microdevices inc silicon wave inc amalfi semiconductor inc and the business combination in prior years the utilization of these acquired domestic tax assets is subject to certain annual limitations as required under internal revenue code section 382 and similar state income tax provisions 

our gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled 906 million  as of april 1 2017  691 million  as of april 2 2016  and 594 million  as of march 28 2015  of these amounts 844 million  net of federal benefit of state taxes 642 million  net of federal benefit of state taxes and 550 million  net of federal benefit of state taxes as of april 1 2017  april 2 2016  and march 28 2015  respectively represent the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective tax rate in each of the fiscal years 

it is our policy to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense during fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  we recognized 21 million  16 million  and 12 million  respectively of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits totaled 71 million  50 million  and 34 million  as of april 1 2017  april 2 2016  and march 28 2015  respectively within the next 12 months we believe it is reasonably possible that only a minimal amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits will be reduced as a result of reductions for tax positions taken in prior years where the only uncertainty was related to the timing of the tax deduction 

stockbased compensation 

under financial accounting standards board fasb asc 718 “compensation – stock compensation”  stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award using an option pricing model for stock options blackscholes and market price for restricted stock units and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period 

as of april 1 2017  total remaining unearned compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units and options was 705 million  which will be amortized over the weightedaverage remaining service period of approximately 12 years  

liquidity and capital resources 

cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity as of april 1 2017  we had working capital of approximately 10428 million  including 5455 million  in cash and cash equivalents compared to working capital of 11354 million  including 4259 million  in cash and cash equivalents as of april 2 2016  

our 5455 million  of total cash and cash equivalents as of april 1 2017  includes approximately 3187 million  held by our foreign subsidiaries if the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are needed in the us we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate our current plans are to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries

cash flows from operating activities   

operating activities in fiscal 2017  provided cash of 7768 million  compared to 6879 million  in fiscal 2016  this yearoveryear increase was due primarily to improvement in working capital partially offset by lower adjustments for noncash items the adjustments for noncash items were lower due primarily to stockbased compensation expense and deferred taxes partially offset by higher depreciation 

operating activities in fiscal 2016  provided cash of 6879 million  compared to 3056 million  in fiscal 2015  this yearoveryear increase was due primarily to improved profitability from the addition of triquints operations exclusive of noncash business combination expenses 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2017  was 4905 million  compared to 2787 million  in fiscal 2016  this increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures related to projects for increasing premium filter capacity and manufacturing cost savings initiatives and the acquisition of greenpeak partially offset by higher net proceeds from availableforsale securities 

net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2016  was 2787 million  compared to 639 million  in fiscal 2015  this increase was primarily due to the business combination in fiscal 2015  that accounted for an increase in cash provided by investing activities of approximately 2243 million  additionally there were higher capital expenditures in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  primarily related to projects for increasing premium filter capacity and manufacturing cost savings initiatives partially offset by increased proceeds from higher net proceeds from availableforsale securities 

  

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017  was 1656 million  compared to 2829 million  in fiscal 2016  this decrease was primarily due to lower share repurchase activity partially offset by lower net proceeds from borrowings 

net cash used in financing activities in 2016  was 2829 million  compared to 1129 million  in fiscal 2015  this increase was primarily due to the repurchase of 243 million  shares of our common stock for approximately 13000 million  partially offset by the net proceeds from the issuance of our notes of approximately 9878 million  during fiscal 2015 the remaining 875 million  principal balance of our 100  convertible subordinated notes due 2014 was paid with cash on hand 

our future capital requirements may differ materially from those currently anticipated and will depend on many factors including market acceptance of and demand for our products acquisition opportunities technological advances and our relationships with suppliers and customers based on current and projected levels of cash flow from operations coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents and our revolving credit facility we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet both our shortterm and longterm cash requirements however if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products or in the event that growth is faster than we had anticipated operating cash flows may be insufficient to meet our needs if existing resources and cash from operations are not sufficient to meet our future requirements or if we perceive conditions to be favorable we may seek additional debt or equity financing we cannot be sure that any additional equity or debt financing will not be dilutive to holders of our common stock further we cannot be sure that additional equity or debt financing if required will be available on favorable terms if at all 

impact of inflation 

we do not believe that the effects of inflation had a significant impact on our revenue or operating income during fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  our financial results in fiscal 2018 could be adversely affected by wage and commodity price inflation including precious metals

capital commitments   

on april 1 2017  we had capital commitments of approximately 977 million  primarily related to projects to increase our premium filter capacity constructing a new office and design center projects for manufacturing cost savings initiatives equipment replacements and general corporate purposes we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 will be lower than capital expenditures in fiscal 2017

purchase obligations   

our purchase obligations totaling approximately 2158 million  are primarily for the purchase of raw materials and manufacturing services that are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet because we had not received the related goods or services as of april 1 2017

lc issuer and a syndicate of lenders the “credit agreement” the credit agreement includes a 3000 million  revolving credit facility which includes a 250 million  sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a 100 million  sublimit for swing line loans we may request at any time and from time to time that the revolving credit facility be increased by an amount not to exceed 1500 million  the revolving credit facility is available to finance working capital capital expenditures and other corporate purposes our obligations under the credit agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed by the guarantors as of april 1 2017  we have no outstanding amounts under the credit agreement 

  

at our option loans under the credit agreement will bear interest at i the applicable rate as defined in the credit agreement plus the eurodollar rate as defined in the credit agreement or ii the applicable rate plus a rate equal to the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 050  b the prime rate of the administrative agent or c the eurodollar base rate plus 10  the “base rate” all swing line loans will bear interest at a rate equal to the applicable rate plus the base rate the eurodollar base rate is the rate per annum equal to the london interbank offered rate as published by bloomberg for dollar deposits for interest periods of one two three or six months as selected by us the applicable rate for eurodollar rate loans ranges from 150  per annum to 200  per annum the applicable rate for base rate loans ranges from 050  per annum to 100  per annum interest for eurodollar rate loans will be payable at the end of each applicable interest period or at threemonth intervals if such interest period exceeds three months interest for base rate loans will be payable quarterly in arrears we will pay a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable rate multiplied by the daily amount available to be drawn under any letter of credit a fronting fee and any customary documentary and processing charges for any letter of credit issued under the credit agreement

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to use judgment and estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management our critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies however these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report 

inventory reserves the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons generally 12 to 24 months the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory reserves are the same as those used in our revenue forecasts and are also consistent with the estimates used in our manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base market conditions and customer acceptance of our products and technologies as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost 

historically inventory reserves have fluctuated as new technologies have been introduced and customers’ demand has shifted inventory reserves had an impact on margins of less than 2  in fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  

revenue recognition   net revenue is generated principally from sales of semiconductor products we recognize revenue from product sales when the fundamental criteria are met such as the time at which the title and risk and rewards of product ownership are transferred to the customer price and terms are fixed or determinable no significant vendor obligation exists and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

sales of products are generally made through either our sales force manufacturers representatives or through a distribution network revenue from the majority of our products is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer from a companyowned or thirdparty location some revenue is recognized upon receipt of the shipment by the customer we have limited rebate programs offering price protection to certain distributors these rebates represent approximately 7  of net revenue in fiscal 2017  and can be reasonably estimated based on specific criteria included in the rebate agreements and other known factors at the time we reduce revenue and record reserves for product returns and allowances for price protection stock rotation and scrap allowance based on historical experience or specific identification depending on the contractual terms of the arrangement 

we also recognize a portion of our net revenue through other agreements such as nonrecurring engineering fees contracts for rd work royalty income intellectual property ip revenue and service revenue these agreements are collectively less than 1  of consolidated revenue on an annual basis revenue from these agreements is recognized when the service is completed or upon certain milestones as provided for in the agreements 

revenue from certain contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the costs incurred to date and the total contract amount plus the contractual fee if these contracts experience cost overruns the percentage of completion method is used to determine revenue recognition revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized when the required deliverable is satisfied 

royalty income is recognized based on a percentage of sales of the relevant product reported by licensees during the period 

in addition we license or sell our rights to use portions of our ip portfolio which includes certain patent rights useful in the manufacture and sales of certain products ip revenue recognition is dependent on the terms of each agreement we will recognize ip revenue i upon delivery of the ip and ii if we have no substantive future obligation to perform under the arrangement we will defer recognition of ip revenue where future performance obligations are required to earn the revenue or the revenue is not guaranteed revenue from services is recognized during the period that the service is performed 

accounts receivable are recorded for all revenue items listed above and do not bear interest we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations subsequent to the original sale we will record an allowance against amounts due and thereby reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected for all other customers we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due industry and geographic concentrations the current business environment and our historical experience 

our terms and conditions do not give our customers a right of return associated with the original sale of our products however we will authorize sales returns under certain circumstances which include perceived quality problems courtesy returns and likekind exchanges we evaluate our estimate of returns by analyzing all types of returns and the timing of such returns in relation to the original sale reserves are adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated returns versus the original sale of product 

goodwill and intangible assets   goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for a business exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired intangibles are recorded when such assets are acquired by purchase or license the value of our intangibles including goodwill could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our 

operating results ii a decline in the value of technology company stocks including the value of our common stock iii a prolonged or more significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the semiconductor industry or iv failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results    

we account for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in accordance with the fasbs guidance which requires annual testing for impairment or whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred we perform our annual impairment tests on the first day of the fourth quarter in each fiscal year our i ndefinitelived intangible assets consist of inprocess research and development iprd 

we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment commonly referred to as step zero to determine whether further quantitative analysis for impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets is necessary in performing step zero for our impairment test we are required to make assumptions and judgments including the following the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to our business industry and market trends and the overall future financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate we also consider recent fair value calculations of our indefinitelived intangible assets and reporting units as well as cost factors such as changes in raw materials labor or other costs if the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinitelived asset is less than its respective carrying value including goodwill then we would perform an additional quantitative analysis for goodwill this involves a twostep process the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit including its goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then the second step of the process is performed to determine the amount of impairment the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recognized for the amount the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 

for indefinitelived intangible assets the quantitative analysis compares the carrying value of the asset to its fair value and an impairment charge is recognized for the amount its carrying value exceeds its fair value determining the fair value of reporting units indefinitelived intangible assets and implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill is reliant upon estimated future revenues profitability and cash flows and consideration of market factors assumptions judgments and estimates are complex subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts although we believe the assumptions judgments and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate different assumptions judgments and estimates could materially affect our results of operations

goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the expected benefit from the synergies of the business combinations generating the underlying goodwill for fis cal 2017  we performed a qualitative assessment of the fair value of our reporting units and as a result of our analysis we determined that there were no indicators of impairment and no further quantitative impairment test was deemed necessary 

for fiscal 2016  although there were no indicators of impairment we opted to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded to perform fair value assessments of our reporting units the first step of the quantitative impairment analysis as the fair value of the reporting units had changed due to the business combination since the last time we performed a quantitative analysis the quantitative assessments performed reaffirmed that there were no indicators of impairment for fiscal 2016  

in performing these quantitative assessments consistent with our historical approach we used both the income and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units the income approach involves discounting future estimated cash flows the sum of the reporting unit cash flow projections was compared to our market capitalization in a discounted cash flow framework to calculate an overall implied internal rate of return or discount rate for the company our market capitalization was adjusted to a control basis assuming a reasonable control premium which resulted in an implied 

discount rate this implied discount rate serves as a baseline for estimating the specific discount rate for each reporting unit 

the discount rate used is the valueweighted average of our estimated cost of equity and debt “cost of capital” derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics our weighted average cost of capital is adjusted for each reporting unit to reflect a risk factor if necessary for each reporting unit we perform sensitivity tests with respect to growth rates and discount rates used in the income approach we believe the income approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the respective reporting unit’s expected longterm operations and cash flow performance 

we considered historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates used in our analysis for fiscal 2016  the material assumptions used for the income approach were eight  years of projected net cash flows and a longterm growth rate of 3  for both the mp and idp reporting units a discount rate of 15  and 16  was used for the mp and idp reporting units respectively 

in applying the market approach valuation multiples are derived from historical and projected operating data of selected guideline companies which are evaluated and adjusted if necessary based on the strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit relative to the selected guideline companies the valuation multiples are then applied to the appropriate historical andor projected operating data of the reporting unit to arrive at an indication of fair value we believe the market approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value using multiples from companies with operations and economic characteristics similar to its reporting units we weighted the results of the income approach and the results of the market approach at 50 each and for the mp and idp reporting units concluded that the fair value of the reporting units was determined to be substantially in excess of the carrying value and as such no further analysis was warranted 

under the income approach the following indicates the sensitivity of key assumptions utilized in the assessment a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the fair value of the mp and idp reporting units by approximately 6600 million  and 1400 million  respectively while a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would have decreased the fair value of the mp and idp reporting units by approximately 5600 million  and 1100 million  respectively a one percentage point decrease in the longterm growth rate would have decreased the fair value of the mp and idp reporting units by approximately 2900 million  and 500 million  respectively while a one percentage point increase in the longterm growth rate would have increased the fair value of the mp and idp reporting units by approximately 3400 million  and 700 million  respectively 

in fiscal year 2015 we performed a qualitative assessment of our reporting units and as a result of our analysis we determined that there were no indicators of impairment and no further quantitative impairment test was deemed necessary 

intangible assets with indefinite lives 

in fiscal 2015 as a result of the business combination we recorded iprd of 4700 million  iprd was recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition as an indefinitelived intangible asset until t he completion or abandonment of the associated rd efforts or impairment the fair value of the acquired iprd was determined based on an income approach using the excess earnings method which   estimated the value of the intangible assets by discounting the future projected earnings of the asset to present value as of the valuation date upon completion of development acquired iprd assets are transferred to finitelived intangible assets and amortized over their useful lives during fiscal years 2017  and 2016  we completed and transferred into developed technology approximately 2200 million  and 2030 million  respectively of iprd we performed a qualitative assessment of the remaining iprd during fiscal 2017  and concluded that iprd was not impaired 

intangible assets  with definite lives 

intangible assets are recorded when such assets are acquired by purchase or license    finitelived intangible assets consist primarily of technology licenses customer relationships developed technology a wafer supply agreement trade names and backlog resulting from business combinations and are subject to amortization 

technology licenses are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straightline basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the technology or the term of the license agreement ranging from approximately five  to eight  years 

the fair value of customer relationships acquired during fiscal years 2013 2015 and 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the “with and without method in which the value of the asset is determined by the difference in discounted cash flows of the profitability of the company with the asset and the profitability of the company without the asset customer relationships are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life ranging from three  to ten  years 

the fair value of developed technology acquired during fiscal years 2013 2015 and 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the excess earnings method which estimated the value of the intangible assets by discounting the future projected earnings of the asset to present value as of the valuation date developed technology is amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life ranging from three  to six  years 

the fair value of a wafer supply agreement acquired in fiscal 2013 was determined using the incremental income method which is a discounted cash flow method within the income approach under this method the fair value was estimated by discounting to present value the additional savings from expense reductions in operations at a discount rate to reflect the risk inherent in the wafer supply agreement as well as any tax benefits the wafer supply agreement was amortized on a units of use activity method over its useful life of approximately four  years and was fully amortized as of april 2 2016 

the fair value of trade names acquired in fiscal years 2015 and 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method in which the value of the asset is determined by discounting the future projected cash flows generated from the trade names estimated royalties trade names are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of two  to three  years 

the fair value of backlog acquired in fiscal 2015 was determined based on an income approach using the excess earnings method and was fully amortized as of april 2 2016 

the fair value of the noncompete agreements acquired in fiscal 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the incremental income method over the useful life of two  years 

we regularly review identified intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life has changed from the original estimate or that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable if such facts and circumstances exist we assess the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts impairments if any are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the impairment determination was made 

income taxes    in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

as part of our financial process we assess on a tax jurisdictional basis the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not likely a likelihood of less than 50 percent the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to ultimately be recoverable in this process certain relevant criteria 

are evaluated including the amount of income or loss in prior years the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies changes in taxable income market conditions us or international tax laws and other factors may change our judgment regarding whether we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets these changes if any may require material adjustments to the net deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding changes in the valuation allowance and net deferred tax assets 

as part of our financial process we also assess the likelihood that our tax reporting positions will ultimately be sustained to the extent it is determined it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of a tax reporting position will ultimately not be recognized and sustained a provision for unrecognized tax benefit is provided by either reducing the applicable deferred tax asset or accruing an income tax liability our judgment regarding the sustainability of our tax reporting positions may change in the future due to changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to the related deferred tax assets or accrued income tax liabilities and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions and the amount of unrecognized tax benefits

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to seek a reduction in the potential negative earnings effects from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity prices arising from our business activities we manage these financial exposures through operational means and by using various financial instruments these practices may change as economic conditions change 

interest rates   

the credit agreement includes a 3000 million  revolving credit facility which includes a 250 million  sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a 100 million  sublimit for swing line loans we may request at any time and from time to time that the revolving credit facility be increased by an amount not to exceed 1500 million  the interest rates on this facility are variable however since we have no outstanding balances under the credit agreement there is no interest rate risk related to this facility as of april 1 2017  

currency exchange rates 

as a global company our results are affected by movements in currency exchange rates our exposure may increase or decrease over time as our foreign business levels fluctuate in the countries where we have operations and these changes could have a material impact on our financial results the functional currency for most of our international operations is the us dollar we have foreign operations in asia europe and costa rica and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the us our international revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars operating expenses and certain working capital items related to our foreignbased operations are in some instances denominated in the local foreign currencies and therefore are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies such as the renminbi euro pound sterling costa rican colon and yen if the us dollar weakens compared to the renminbi euro pound sterling costa rican colon yen and other currencies our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when remeasured back into us dollars we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means 

for fiscal 2017  we incurred a foreign currency loss of 32 million  as compared to a loss of 07 million  in fiscal 2016  which is recorded in “other expense income” 

  

our financial instrument holdings including foreign receivables cash and payables at april 1 2017  were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes in this sensitivity analysis we assumed that the change in one currencys rate relative to the us dollar would not have an effect on other currencies rates relative to the us dollar all other factors were held constant if the us dollar declined in value 10 in relation to the remeasured foreign currency instruments our net income would have increased  by approximately 19 million  if the us dollar increased in value 10 in relation to the remeasured foreign currency instruments our net income would have decreased  by approximately 16 million  

commodity prices 

we routinely use precious metals in the manufacture of our products supplies for such commodities may from time to time become restricted or general market factors and conditions may affect the pricing of such commodities we also have an active reclamation process to capture any unused gold while we continue to attempt to mitigate the risk of similar increases in commoditiesrelated costs there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully safeguard against potential shortterm and longterm commodity price fluctuations

in connection with the business combination in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we renamed our cellular products group operating segment as mp and our multimarket products group operating segment as idp for financial information about the results of our operating segments for each of the last three fiscal years see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report 

industry overview   

our business is diversified across multiple industries the cellular handset industry is our largest market and is characterized by large unit volumes frequent product mix shift high technical barriers to entry and relatively short product lifecycles 

to satisfy the growing global demand for alwayson high datathroughput connectivity cellular handsets are transitioning rapidly from entry level 2g and 3g handsets to 4g lte devices these 4g devices incorporate new cellular bands and modes to enable more geographic coverage including “global” phones that are not limited to specific regions or carriers additionally 4g lte devices are beginning to incorporate carrier aggregation to allow simultaneous communication over multiple frequency bands and to provide consumers with a more satisfying higher datathroughput experience while helping network operators maximize spectral efficiency and better monetize their costly spectrum investments because 4g lte devices often contain two to five times more rf content than 3g phones the market for our rf components has been expanding in recent years we believe these trends will continue as consumers continue to demand greater data throughput and as smartphone manufacturers and network operators seek to improve the performance of 4g lte devices to attract and retain customers and enhance revenue 

the rapid proliferation of the iot is also driving the growth in demand for rf content for new classes of devices including systems for connected homes energy management systems and a variety of health fitness and medical devices which use wireless connectivity to transmit data obtained from embedded sensors meters controllers and other components as part of this phenomena machinetomachine “m2m” devices are increasingly integrating 

wifi and cellular content for a growing number of applications including automotive electric and water utilities fleet management and pointofsale 

in cellular infrastructure network operators are rapidly building out their 4g lte networks to handle more data traffic which increases the requirements for more and faster wireless backhaul systems including upgrading transport capacity through microwave pointtopoint radio and optical network links in addition to increase network coverage and capacity and ease the strain from skyrocketing mobile data traffic on congested cellular networks the cellular infrastructure market is turning to wifi offload strategies including public access wifi hotspots and utilizing new architectures with small cell base stations such as micro cells pico cells and femtocells the rf content in premisesbased devices and distribution networks is increasing due to higher capacity requirements achieved through enabling increased bandwidth capability typically at higher frequencies of operation 

in our catv and optical network wireline transport markets the rapid explosion of consumer and business data transmission whether from high definition television “hdtv” internet protocol television “iptv” and voice over internet protocol “voip” as well as the associated increases in internet traffic in data centers are driving market growth and placing increased emphasis on product performance integration and power consumption the adoption of docsis 31 is accelerating and driving our catv business additionally the everincreasing performance demands for telecom data centers and metro networks continue to drive our optical business both markets are equally concerned about increasing capacity and speed while decreasing costs and power consumption 

defense and aerospace markets rely on dependable microwave monolithic integrated circuits mmics and discrete transistors in dielevel and packaged forms as well as surface acoustic wave saw and bulk acoustic wave baw filters the global defense and aerospace industry that we serve is focused on balancing cost performance and power consumption and is serviced through both commercial offtheshelf products and custom devices for the most stringent applications that support the next generation of communication defense and national security capabilities 

in connectivity markets we are focused on delivering worldclass products that address the higher performance requirements of 80211ac and the proliferation of wifi in mobile devices such as tablets and notebook computers and nonmobile equipment including routers access points settop boxes automobiles and televisions in these same markets we enable interferencefree reception and transmission through our premium filter products

markets products and applications 

we offer a broad array of amplification filtering and switching products for rf microwave and millimeterwave applications we utilize specialized substrate materials and highperformance process technologies such as gaas gan soi pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistors “phemt” baw and sige we believe many of our products offer key advantages relative to competing devices including steeper selectivity improved linearity lower distortion higher output power and poweradded efficiency as well as reduced size and weight and more precise frequency control our broad range of standard and customerspecific integrated circuits “ics” components and modules in addition to saw tcsaw and baw duplexers and filters combined with our manufacturing and design capabilities allow customers to select the specific product solution that best fulfills their technical and timetomarket requirements 

we focus on four broader end markets mobile products high speed network connectivity defense and the iot 

mobile products 

the demand for rf solutions in mobile products is accelerating with the increasing demand for enhanced voice and data communication capabilities consumers want mobile devices to provide signal quality similar to wired communication systems to be smaller and lighter to dissipate less heat to accommodate longer talk and standby time and to feature energyconsuming functionality such as larger screens streaming media digital cameras video recorders global positioning systems “gps” bluetooth ®  connectivity and internet access the most significant trend today in the mobile devices market is the proliferation of 4g lte devices that work across multiple standards and frequency bands enabling multiregion access and coverage this is expanding the overall dollar content in an average smartphone by two to five times compared to a traditional voiceonly phone 

the associated increase in wireless data traffic creates congestion on network operators’ assigned frequency bands limiting their network capacity because network operators spend billions of dollars on frequency spectrum this places a premium on smartphones with greater rf functionality to enable increased capacity concurrently new wireless communications standards and new technologies are being deployed to more efficiently utilize the available spectrum this increases the complexity of smartphones and heightens the performance requirements especially for filtering which in turn favors qorvo’s broad product portfolio and our technology and product leadership strategy 

qorvo’s comprehensive mobile product portfolio includes our highperformance rf fusion™ line of integrated rf solutions rf fusion™  leverages qorvo’s rf product portfolio advanced packaging and process technologies and deep systemslevel expertise to integrate all major transmit and receive rf functionality into highly integrated lowband midband and highband placements we also offer rf flex™ modules which leverage our deep systemslevel expertise to integrate core cellular transmit and receive functionality into highperformance multiband pa modules and transmit modules our rf flex  solutions deliver worldclass performance and enable carrier aggregation in the industry’s most flexible scalable and costeffective lte architectures other products include filters duplexers switches transmit modules modules incorporating switches pas and duplexers “spads” rf power management ics diversity receive modules antenna switch modules antenna tuning and control solutions multimode multiband pas and other advanced products 

our access to various process technologies such as gaas sige soi and other silicon variants saw tcsaw and baw provides our mobile device designers with flexibility to address our customers’ requirements for low noise better signal processing in congested bands greater power efficiency for longer battery life and low loss switching 

historically we have experienced seasonal fluctuations in our sales of mobile products our revenue is generally the strongest in the second and third fiscal quarters and weakest in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year 

high speed network connectivity 

we sell products that support the transfer of voice video and data across wireless and wired infrastructure the increasing demand for applications services and the associated highspeed data for smartphones tablets computers and tvs is driving a dramatic evolution in the infrastructure that carries this data this translates to requirements for systems and components with higher frequency broader bandwidth greater linearity lower power consumption and smaller size to reduce operator complexity and capital investment systems need to cover multiple bands and modulation standards without increasing size or cost 

our products for the high speed networks end market target three main applications 

 

 

 

we offer a broad range of products for these applications including lownoise variablegain driver and power amplifiers single and dual band wireless local area network wlan modules digital and analog attenuators voltagecontrolled oscillators “vco”s switches saw filters baw filters and multichip modules that integrate multiple functions 

we use our unique gaas gan saw and baw processes combined with innovative design and packaging to differentiate our products for example in base station applications our gaas hbt amplifiers offer differentiated low noise performance while our gan amplifiers offer high linearity and efficiency with high output power and low power consumption in optical transport networks infrastructure our modulator drivers provide a wide output voltage swing low jitter and high fidelity electrical “eye” performance for 40 and 100 gigabits per second networks 

we utilize our process and assembly technologies to achieve superior performance and integrate rf functionality at both the integrated circuit and multichip module levels the range of process technologies we can draw upon spans from 100 megahertz to 100 gigahertz low noise to high power as an example our highvoltage hbt and gan processes provide two options for addressing very high power high efficiency and high linearity applications our multichip modules utilize our highvolume assembly capabilities used in the manufacturing of our products for the mobile devices end market to achieve low cost and high quality for infrastructure applications 

we sell amplifier and rf filtering products for a number of applications that enable wireless connectivity including wifi used in consumer premises equipment and enterprise wireless access points and automotive satellite radio lte and infotainment applications 

defense and aerospace 

our largest customers in the defense and aerospace end markets are military contractors serving the us government these prime contractors and subcontractors use our dielevel integrated circuits and discrete components mmics and multichip modules for radar electronic warfare and communications systems these programs include major shipboard airborne and battlefield radar systems as well as communications and electronic warfare applications our products are used in largescale programs with long leadtimes once a component has been designed into an enduse product for a military application the same component is generally used during the entire production life of the enduse product 

our products utilized in radars are bringing new capabilities to detect and neutralize threats against aircrews shipboard and infantry defense forces around the globe we are actively engaged with existing customers while seeking greater emerging application opportunities for example our legacy of phased array radar experience with domestic airborne fighter platforms has led to ongoing work in the multinational next generation platforms in addition we expect our products to be used in retrofits that upgrade the radars and other systems for the existing domestic fleet of fighter aircraft 

the capability to track multiple targets simultaneously is one of the key enhancements found in the new generation of fighter jets we are teamed with contractors in new programs to bring this type of capability to our defense customers and we also are engaged in retrofits of other tactical fighter jet programs our microwave pas provide the capability to transmit the power that is at the heart of phased array radar operation these radars consist of large element arrays composed of many individual integrated circuits in addition to supplying components for airborne and groundbased phased array radars we are engaged with prime defense contractors in the continuing development and production of radars for shipboard applications in the military communications field we supply filters amplifiers and other components for handheld and satellite communications systems in addition we use our packaging and integrated assembly expertise to speed designs facilitate multichip package evolution and deliver costeffective solutions for all types of customer needs 

our dod accreditation as a microelectronics trusted source is an assurance that our processes and procedures meet stringent quality and security controls which can permit increased levels of high securityclassified application specific integrated circuit foundry services through accreditation we join a small group of gaas suppliers certified by the dod as able to fabricate and deliver devices for applications using standards approved and monitored by the defense microelectronics activity we have also been certified by the dod as having manufacturing readiness level 9 for our gan fabrication capabilities which certifies us as having the necessary systems and demonstrated capabilities in place for rate production 

we are also directly engaged with the us government primarily through contracts with the defense advanced research project agency the air force research laboratory and the office of naval research to develop the next generation of rf components in gan and gaas gan high electron mobility transistor devices provide the higher power density and efficiency required for future highpower phased array radar electronic warfare missile seekers and communications systems through these programs and other ongoing efforts we continue to enhance the reliability and manufacturability of our gan processes 

revenue from the sales of our products in the defense and aerospace end market can fluctuate significantly from year to year due to the timing of programs 

internet of things iot 

we sell products that support the rapid explosion of connected devices under the umbrella of the iot these products include amplifier and rf filtering products for automotive applications including automotive infotainment satellite radios radar and telematics and various industrial applications including smart energyadvanced metering infrastructure “ami” systems the most basic ami systems provide a way for a utility company to measure customer usage remotely without touching or physically reading a meter 

in addition through the acquisition of greenpeak technologies in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we offer cmos soc solutions for smart home and remote control applications these solutions include embedded firmware as well as customer support for development of application software to facilitate integration of our socs into customer designs 

the markets for applications that fall under iot are just beginning to emerge we expect that the mobile phone which has proliferated throughout the world in the last decade will be one of many nodes that provide users with the ability to sense control view communicate with and access networks across a very wide range of applications and platforms some of which are not fully envisioned today 

manufacturing 

we have a global supply chain and routinely ship millions of units per day our products have varying degrees of complexity and rely on semiconductors and other components that are manufactured inhouse or outsourced the majority of our products are multichip modules utilizing multiple semiconductor process technologies we are a leading supplier of rf solutions and a leading manufacturer of gaas hbt gaas phemt gan saw tcsaw and baw for rf applications 

we operate wafer fabrication facilities for the production of gaas gan saw tcsaw and baw wafers in greensboro north carolina hillsboro oregon richardson texas and apopka florida in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we acquired an additional wafer fabrication facility in farmers branch texas which we currently plan 

to use to expand our baw filter capacity we also use multiple siliconbased process technologies including soi sige and cmos in our products we outsource all silicon manufacturing to leading silicon foundries located throughout the world 

we have our own flip chip and wlp technologies and also use external suppliers for these and other packaging technologies in packages that employ flip chips the electrical connections are created directly on the surface of the die which eliminates wirebonds so that the die may be attached directly to a substrate or leadframe this type of technology provides a higher density interconnection capability than wirebonded die and enables smaller form factors with improved thermal and electrical performance we also use waferlevel packaging “wlp” technologies for our saw tcsaw and baw filter products 

once the semiconductor manufacturing is complete the wafers are singulated or separated into individual units called die for our module products the next step in our manufacturing process is assembly during assembly the die and other necessary components are placed on a high density interconnect substrate to provide connectivity between the die and the components this populated substrate is formed into a microelectronic package once assembled the products are tested for rf performance and prepared for shipment through a tape and reel process to assemble and test our products we primarily use internal assembly facilities in the united states china costa rica and germany and we also utilize several external suppliers we also manufacture large volumes of wlp die and discrete filters that our customers directly assemble into their products 

the fabrication of ics and filter products is highly complex and sensitive to particles and other contaminants and requires production in a highly controlled clean environment minute impurities difficulties in the fabrication process or defects in the masks used to transfer circuits onto the wafers can cause a substantial percentage of the wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional the more brittle nature of gaas wafers can also lead to more wafer breakages than experienced with silicon wafers 

to maximize wafer yield and quality we test our products in various stages in the fabrication process maintain continuous reliability monitoring and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow our manufacturing yields vary significantly among our products depending upon a given product’s complexity and our manufacturing experience 

we incur a high level of fixed costs to operate our own manufacturing facilities these fixed costs consist primarily of facility occupancy costs repair maintenance and depreciation costs related to manufacturing equipment and fixed labor costs related to manufacturing and process engineering 

our quality management system is registered to iso 9001 standards and our environmental management system is registered to iso 14001 a thirdparty independent auditor has determined that these systems meet the requirements developed by the international organization of standardization a nongovernmental network of the national standards institutes of over 160 countries the iso 9001 standard is based on a number of quality management principles including a strong customer focus the motivation and implication of top management the process approach and continual improvement iso 14001 is an internationally agreed upon standard that sets out the requirements for an environmental management system it improves our environmental performance through more efficient use of resources and reduction of waste gaining a competitive advantage and the trust of stakeholders we require that all of our key vendors and suppliers are compliant with applicable iso 9001 or ts16949 standards which means that their operations have in each case been determined by auditors to comply with internationally developed quality control standards 

our manufacturing facilities in greensboro north carolina hillsboro oregon richardson texas and apopka florida are certified to isots 16949 standards which is the highest international quality standard for the automotive industry and incorporates iso technical specifications that are more stringent than iso 9001 quality management systems requirements the isots 16949 standard combines north american and european automotive requirements and serves the global automotive market 

raw materials 

we purchase numerous raw materials passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing processes we use independent foundries to supply all of our siliconbased integrated circuits high demand for 

soi wafers to support manufacture of our switch products has led to supply constraints in the past which we have addressed by qualifying new silicon foundries and securing supply commitments from existing silicon suppliers 

for our acoustic filter manufacturing operations we use several raw materials including wafers made from quartz silicon lithium niobate “linbo 3 ” or lithium tantalite “litao 3 ” as well as ceramic or metal packages relatively few companies produce these raw materials we are leading the industry in developing saw filters using sixinch linbo 3 wafers and we have qualified more than one source for this wafer material for all of our saw operations we utilize multiple qualified wafer and mask set vendors our most significant suppliers of ceramic surface mount packages are based in japan 

our manufacturing strategy includes a balance of internal and external sites primarily for assembly operations which helps reduce costs provides flexibility of supply and minimizes the risk of supply disruption we routinely qualify multiple sources of supply and manufacturing sites to reduce the risk of supply interruptions or price increases and closely monitor suppliers’ key performance indicators our suppliers and our manufacturing sites are geographically diversified with our largest volume sources distributed throughout southern and eastern asia and we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing needs 

customers 

we design develop manufacture and market our products to leading us and international oems and odms we are also engaged with leading baseband reference design partners located primarily in the us and china 

some of our mp customers use multiple contract manufacturers for product assembly and test therefore revenue for one customer may not necessarily represent the entire business of a single mobile products manufacturer we provided our products to our largest end customer through sales to multiple contract manufacturers which in the aggregate accounted for approximately 37  32  and 20  of total revenue in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively huawei technologies co ltd accounted for 12  7  and 4  of our total revenue in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively samsung electronics co ltd accounted for approximately 7  14  and 25  of our total revenue in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the majority of the revenue from these customers was from our mobile product sales no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue in any of the last three fiscal years 

some of our sales to overseas customers are made under export licenses that must be obtained from the us department of commerce 

information about revenue including segment revenue operating profit or loss and total assets is presented in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

sales and marketing 

we sell our products worldwide directly to customers as well as through a network of domestic and foreign sales representative firms and distributors we select our domestic and foreign sales representatives based on technical skills and sales experience as well as the presence of complementary product lines and the customer base served we provide ongoing training to our internal as well as our external sales representatives and distributors to keep them informed of and educated about our products we maintain an internal sales and marketing organization that is responsible for key account management application engineering support to customers developing sales and advertising literature and preparing technical presentations for industry conferences we have sales and customer support centers located throughout the world 

we maintain an extensive website containing product information and publish a comprehensive product selection guide annually our global team of application engineers interacts with customers during all stages of design and production provides customers with product application notes and engineering data maintains regular contact with customer engineers and assists in the resolution of technical problems we believe that maintaining a close relationship with customers and platform providers and providing them with strong technical support enhances their level of satisfaction and enables us to anticipate their future product needs 

research and development 

our rd activities enable the technologies and products necessary to maintain our leadership in the end markets we serve our rd activities are focused on improving the performance size and cost of our products in our customers’ systems we focus on both continuous improvement in our processes for design and manufacture as well as innovation in fundamental research areas such as materials simulation and modeling circuit design device packaging and test we maintain an extensive patent portfolio and also protect much of our intellectual property in the form of trade secrets 

we have developed several generations of gaas gan baw and saw process technologies that we manufacture internally we invest in these technologies to improve device performance reduce die size and reduce manufacturing costs we also develop and qualify technologies made available to us from key suppliers including soi for switches and rf signal conditioning solutions sige and inp for amplifiers and cmos for power management devices and soc solutions we combine these external technologies with our own proprietary design methods intellectual property and other expertise to improve performance increase integration and reduce the size and cost of our products 

our rf systemslevel expertise and our innovations in new product architectures new circuit techniques filtering and other new proprietary technologies are enabling us to solve the increasingly complex rf challenges related to linearity power consumption and other critical performance metrics this is evident in our line of highperformance rf fusion™  and versatile rf flex™ integrated modules 

qorvo is a pioneer in envelope tracking “et” technology for wireless applications and we are incorporating our et technology into power management components and our most advanced pas our et technology enables us to track the envelope of highspeed modulation signals and adjust the pa in real time to maximize efficiency and maintain required levels of linearity this technology is increasingly necessary to maximize mobile device data rates and meet user expectations for battery life and maximum case temperatures because our customers often use a variety of baseband and power management chipsets we also develop pas that demonstrate industryleading performance with thirdparty power management components 

we continue to develop and release new ganbased products and invest in new gan process technologies to exploit gans performance advantages across existing and new product categories the inherent wide band gap high electron mobility and high breakdown voltage characteristics of gan semiconductor devices offer significant performance advantages versus competing technologies we are also developing other advanced gan process technologies that target applications where we anticipate gan devices will provide a disruptive performance advantage and deliver meaningful energy savings in endmarket products 

in the area of packaging technologies we are developing and qualifying packaging technologies that allow us to improve performance and reduce the area and height of our products we are continuing to invest in packaging technologies such as wlp and flip chip bumping that eliminate wire bonds reduce the size and component height and improve performance while reducing the cost of packaging our products in addition we are investing in large scale module assembly and test capabilities to bring these technologies to market in very high volumes 

in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 we incurred approximately 4488 million  2575 million  and 1973 million  respectively in rd expenses we expect to continue to spend substantial funds on rd in support of our growth and product diversification goals 

competition 

we operate in a very competitive industry characterized by rapid advances in technology and new product introductions our customers product life cycles are short and our competitiveness depends on our ability to improve our products and processes faster than our competitors anticipate changing customer requirements and successfully develop and launch new products while reducing our costs our competitiveness is also affected by the quality of our customer service and technical support and our ability to design customized products that address each customers particular requirements within the customers cost limitations the selection process for our products to be included in our customers new products is highly competitive and our customers provide no guarantees that our products will be included in the next generation of products introduced 

we compete primarily with the following companies analog devices inc broadcom limited macom technology solutions inc murata manufacturing co ltd qualcomm technologies inc raytheon company skyworks solutions inc and sumitomo electric device innovations 

many of our current and potential competitors have entrenched market positions and customer relationships established patents and other intellectual property and substantial technological capabilities in some cases our competitors are also our customers or suppliers additionally many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing and marketing resources than we do which may allow them to implement new technologies and develop new products more quickly than we can 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property including patents copyrights trademarks maskworks and trade secrets is important to our business and we actively seek opportunities to leverage our intellectual property portfolio to promote our business interests we also actively seek to monitor and protect our global intellectual property rights and to deter unauthorized use of our intellectual property and other assets such efforts can be difficult because of the absence of consistent international standards and laws moreover we respect the intellectual property rights of others and have implemented policies and procedures to mitigate the risk of infringing or misappropriating third party intellectual property 

patent applications are filed within the us and in other countries where we have a market presence on occasion some applications do not mature into patents for various reasons including rejections based on prior art in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws we have more than 1100 patents that expire from 2016 to 2036 we also continue to acquire patents through acquisitions or direct prosecution efforts and engage in licensing transactions to secure the right to practice third parties’ patents in view of our rapid innovation and product development and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes there is no guarantee that our products will not be obsolete before the related patents expire or are granted however we believe the duration and scope of our most relevant patents are sufficient to support our business which as a whole is not significantly dependent on any particular patent or other intellectual property right as we expand our products and offerings we also seek to expand our patent prosecution efforts to cover such products 

we periodically register federal trademarks service marks and trade names that distinguish our product brand names in the market we also monitor these marks for their proper and intended use additionally we rely on nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our interest in confidential and proprietary information that give us a competitive advantage including business strategies unpatented inventions designs and process technology such information is closely monitored and made available only to those employees whose responsibilities require access to the information 

backlog 

our sales are the result of standard purchase orders or specific agreements with customers we maintain qorvoowned finished goods inventory at certain customers’ “hub” locations and do not recognize revenue until our customers draw down the inventory at these hubs our customers’ projections of consumption of hub inventory and quantities on purchase orders as well as the shipment schedules are frequently revised within agreedupon lead times to reflect changes in the customers’ needs because industry practice allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment and with little or no penalty we believe that backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels 

employees 

on april 2 2016  we had more than 7300 employees we believe that our future prospects will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain skilled employees competition for skilled personnel is intense and the number of persons with relevant experience particularly in rf engineering product design and technical marketing is limited none of our us employees are represented by a labor union a number of our europebased employees less than 5 of our global workforce as of april 2 2016 are subject to collective bargainingtype works council arrangements we have never experienced any work stoppage and we believe that our current employee relations are good 

geographic financial summary 

a summary of our operations by geographic area is as follows in thousands 



sales for geographic disclosure purposes are based on the “sold to” address of the customer the “sold to” address is not always an accurate representation of the location of final consumption of our products of our total revenue for fiscal 2016  approximately 61   16010 million  was attributable to customers in china and approximately 14   3651 million  was attributable to customers in taiwan 

longlived tangible assets primarily include property and equipment at april 2 2016  approximately 1838 million  or 18  of our total property and equipment was located in china 

for financial information regarding our operations by geographic area see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item 8 of this report 

for a summary of certain risks associated with our foreign operations see item 1a “risk factors” 

  

environmental matters 

by virtue of operating our wafer fabrication facilities we are subject to a variety of extensive and changing domestic and international federal state and local governmental laws regulations and ordinances related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in the manufacturing process we provide our own manufacturing waste water treatment and disposal for most of our manufacturing facilities and we have contracted for the disposal of hazardous waste state agencies require us to report usage of environmentally hazardous materials and we have retained appropriate personnel to help ensure compliance with all applicable environmental regulations we believe that costs arising from existing environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

we are an iso 140012004 certified manufacturer with a comprehensive environmental management system “ems” in place in order to help ensure control of the environmental aspects of the manufacturing process our ems mandates compliance and establishes appropriate checks and balances to minimize the potential for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations 

we actively monitor the hazardous materials that are used in the manufacture assembly and testing of our products particularly materials that are retained in the final product we have developed specific restrictions on the content of certain hazardous materials in our products as well as those of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers and subcontractors this helps to ensure that our products are compliant with the requirements of the markets into which the products will be sold for example our products are compliant with the european union rohs directive 201165eu on the restriction of use of hazardous substances which prohibits the sale in the european union market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing certain families of substances above a specified threshold 

we do not currently anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2018

 item 1a risk factors 

our operating results fluctuate 

our revenue earnings margins and other operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future if demand for our products fluctuates as a result of economic conditions or for other reasons our revenue and profitability could be impacted our future operating results will depend on many factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is likely that our future operating results could be adversely affected by one or more of the factors set forth above or other similar factors if our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market analysts or our investors our stock price may decline 

our operating results are substantially dependent on development of new products and achieving design wins   

the average selling prices of our products have historically decreased over the products lives and we expect this to continue to offset these average selling price decreases we must achieve yield improvements and other cost reductions for existing products and introduce new products that can be manufactured at lower costs or that command higher prices based on superior performance our future success is dependent on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely and costeffective manner and secure production orders from our customers the development of new products is a highly complex process and we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products at times in the past our successful product development depends on a number of factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to design and introduce new products in a timely or costefficient manner and our new products may fail to meet the requirements of the market or our customers in that case we likely will not reach the expected level of production orders which could adversely affect our operating results even when a design win is achieved our success is not assured design wins may require significant expenditures by us and typically precede volume revenue by six to nine months or more many customers seek a second source for all major components in their devices which can significantly impact the revenue obtained from a design win the actual value of a design win to us will ultimately depend on the commercial success of our customer’s product 

we depend on a few large customers for a substantial portion of our revenue 

a substantial portion of our mp revenue comes from large purchases by a small number of customers our future operating results depend on both the success of our largest customers and on our success in diversifying our products and customer base 

we typically manufacture custom products on an exclusive basis for individual customers for a negotiated period of time increasingly the largest cellular handset oems are releasing fewer new phone models on an annual basis which heightens the importance of achieving design wins for these larger opportunities while the rewards for a design win are financially greater competition for these projects is intense the concentration of our revenue with a relatively small number of customers makes us particularly dependent on factors affecting those customers for example if demand for their products decreases they may stop purchasing our products and our operating results would suffer most of our customers can cease incorporating our products into their products with little notice to us and with little or no penalty the loss of a large customer and failure to add new customers to replace lost revenue would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face risks of a loss of revenue if contracts with the us government or defense and aerospace contractors are canceled or delayed 

we receive a portion of our revenue from the us government and from prime contractors on us governmentsponsored programs principally for defense and aerospace applications these programs are subject to delays or cancellation further spending on defense and aerospace contracts can vary significantly depending on funding from the us government we believe our government and defense and aerospace contracts in the recent past have been negatively affected by external factors such as sequestration and political pressure to reduce federal defense spending reductions in defense and aerospace funding or the loss of a significant defense and aerospace program or contract would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we depend heavily on third parties 

we purchase numerous component parts substrates and siliconbased products from external suppliers we also utilize thirdparty suppliers for numerous services including die processing wafer bumping test and tape and reel the use of external suppliers involves a number of risks including the possibility of material disruptions in the supply of key components and the lack of control over delivery schedules capacity constraints manufacturing yields product quality and fabrication costs 

we currently use several external manufacturing suppliers to supplement our internal manufacturing capabilities we believe all of our key vendors and suppliers are compliant with applicable iso 9001 andor ts16949 standards however if these vendors processes vary in reliability or quality they could negatively affect our products our reputation and our results of operations 

we face risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing facilities 

we operate wafer fabrication facilities in florida north carolina oregon and texas we currently use several international and domestic assembly suppliers as well as internal assembly facilities in the us china costa rica the philippines and germany to assemble and test our products we currently have our own test and tape and reel facilities located in the us china costa rica and the philippines and we also utilize contract suppliers and partners in asia to test our products 

a number of factors will affect the future success of our facilities including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions climate change medical epidemics or pandemics and other public health issues military actions acts of terrorism political or regulatory issues and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events we carry commercial property damage and business interruption insurance against various risks with limits we deem adequate for reimbursement for damage to our fixed assets and resulting disruption of our operations however the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and increase our costs and expenses any disruptions from these events could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations and have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results to the extent that losses exceed insurance recoveries and to the extent that such disruptions might adversely impact our relationships with our customers 

if we experience poor manufacturing yields our operating results may suffer 

our products are very complex each product has a unique design and is fabricated using semiconductor process technologies that are highly complex in many cases the products are assembled in customized packages our products many of which consist of multiple components in a single package feature enhanced levels of integration and complexity our customers insist that our products be designed to meet their exact specifications for quality performance and reliability our manufacturing yield is a combination of yields across the entire supply chain including wafer fabrication assembly and test yields due to the complexity of our products we periodically experience difficulties in achieving acceptable yields and other quality issues particularly with respect to new products 

our customers test our products once they have been assembled into their products the number of usable products that result from our production process can fluctuate as a result of many factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we constantly seek to improve our manufacturing yields typically for a given level of sales when our yields improve our gross margins improve and when our yields decrease our unit costs are higher our margins are lower and our operating results are adversely affected 

costs of product defects and deviations from required specifications could include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these costs could be significant and could reduce our gross margins our reputation with customers also could be damaged as a result of product defects and quality issues and product demand could be reduced which could harm our business and financial results 

we are subject to increased inventory risks and costs because we build our products based on forecasts provided by customers before receiving purchase orders for the products 

in order to ensure availability of our products for some of our largest customers we start manufacturing certain products in advance of receiving purchase orders based on forecasts provided by these customers however these forecasts do not represent binding purchase commitments and we do not recognize sales for these products until they are shipped to or consumed by the customer as a result we incur significant inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales because demand for our products may not materialize manufacturing based on forecasts subjects us to heightened risks of higher inventory carrying costs increased obsolescence and higher operating costs these inventory risks are exacerbated when our customers purchase indirectly through contract manufacturers or hold component inventory levels greater than their consumption rate because this reduces our visibility regarding the customers accumulated levels of inventory if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to writeoff inventory which would have a negative impact on our gross margin and other operating results 

we sell certain of our products based on reference designs of platform providers and our inability to effectively manage or maintain our evolving relationships with these companies may have an adverse effect on our business 

platform providers are typically large companies that provide system reference designs for oems and odms that include the platform providers baseband and other complementary products a platform provider may own or control ip that gives it a strong market position for their baseband products for certain air interface standards which provides it with significant influence and control over sales of rf products for these standards platform providers historically looked to us and our competitors to provide rf products to their customers as part of the overall system design and we competed with other rf companies to have our products included in the platform providers system reference design this market dynamic has evolved in recent years as platform providers have worked to develop more fully integrated solutions that include their own rf technologies and components 

platform providers may be in a different business from ours or we may be their customer or direct competitor accordingly we must balance our interest in obtaining new business with competitive and other factors because platform providers control the overall system reference design if they offer competitive rf technologies or their own rf solutions as a part of their reference design and exclude our products from the design we are at a distinct competitive disadvantage with oems and odms that are seeking a turnkey design solution even if our products offer superior performance this requires us to work more closely with oems and odms to secure the design of our products in their handsets and other devices 

our relationships with platform providers are complex and evolving and the inability to effectively manage or maintain these relationships could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to risks from international sales and operations 

we operate globally with sales offices and rd activities as well as manufacturing assembly and testing facilities in multiple countries as a result we are subject to regulatory geopolitical and other risks associated with doing business outside the us global operations involve inherent risks that include currency controls and fluctuations as well as tariff import and other related restrictions and regulations 

sales to customers located outside the us accounted for approximately 88  of our revenue in fiscal 2016  of which approximately 61 and 14 were attributable to sales to customers located in china and taiwan respectively we expect that revenue from international sales to china and other markets will continue to be a significant part of our total revenue any weakness in the chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for consumer products that contain our products which could materially and adversely affect our business 

because the majority of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars our products become less pricecompetitive in countries with currencies that are low or are declining in value against the us dollar also we cannot be sure that our international customers will continue to accept orders denominated in us dollars 

the majority of our assembly test and tape and reel vendors are located in asia we do the majority of our business with our foreign assemblers in us dollars our manufacturing costs could increase in countries with currencies that are increasing in value against the us dollar also we cannot be sure that our international manufacturing suppliers will continue to accept orders denominated in us dollars 

in addition if terrorist activity armed conflict civil or military unrest or political instability occur such events may disrupt manufacturing assembly logistics security and communications and could also result in reduced demand for our products pandemics and similar major health concerns could also adversely affect our business and our customer order patterns we could also be affected if labor issues disrupt our transportation or manufacturing arrangements or those of our customers or suppliers on a worldwide basis we regularly review our key infrastructure systems services and suppliers both internally and externally to seek to identify significant vulnerabilities as well as areas of potential business impact if a disruptive event were to occur once identified we assess the risks and as we consider it to be appropriate we initiate actions intended to minimize the risks and their potential impact however there can be no assurance that we have identified all significant risks or that we can mitigate all identified risks with reasonable effort 

economic regulation in china could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we have a significant portion of our assembly and testing capacity in china in recent years the chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation in response to these factors the chinese government has from time to time adopted measures to regulate growth and contain inflation including measures designed to restrict credit or to control prices such actions in the future could increase the cost of doing business in china or decrease the demand for our products in china which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in may 2015 china’s government implemented a policy applicable to the three chinese stateowned mobile telecommunications carriers that mandated 4g lte network improvements and that implemented subsidies for chinese consumers for both the purchase of 4g lte mobile devices and for mobile telecom data service fees if subsidies under this policy are ended or curtailed our business results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

we operate in a very competitive industry and must continue to implement innovative technologies 

we compete with several companies primarily engaged in the business of designing manufacturing and selling rf solutions as well as suppliers of discrete integrated circuits and modules in addition to our direct competitors some of our largest customers and leading platform partners also compete with us to some extent by designing and manufacturing their own products increased competition from any source could adversely affect our operating results through lower prices for our products reduced demand for our products losses of existing design slots with key customers and a corresponding reduction in our ability to recover development engineering and manufacturing costs 

many of our existing and potential competitors have entrenched market positions historical affiliations with oems considerable internal manufacturing capacity established ip rights and substantial technological capabilities many of our existing and potential competitors may have greater financial technical manufacturing or marketing resources than we do we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully with our competitors 

our industrys technology changes rapidly 

we primarily design and manufacture highperformance semiconductor components for wireless applications our markets are characterized by the frequent introduction of new products in response to evolving product and process technologies and consumer demand for greater functionality lower costs smaller products and better performance as a result we have experienced and will continue to experience some product design obsolescence we expect our customers demands for reductions in cost and improvements in product performance to continue which means that we must continue to improve our product designs and develop new products that may use new technologies it is possible that competing technologies will emerge that permit the manufacture of products that are equivalent or acceptable in terms of performance but lower in cost to the products we make under existing processes if we cannot design products using competitive technologies or develop competitive products our operating results will be adversely affected 

industry overcapacity could cause us to underutilize our manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

it is difficult to predict future growth or decline in the demand for our products which makes it very difficult to estimate requirements for production capacity in prior fiscal years we have added significant capacity through acquisitions as well as by expanding capacity at our existing manufacturing facilities and we are in the process of expanding our baw saw and tcsaw filter capacity at our existing facilities including a new facility that we purchased in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 

in the past capacity additions by us and our competitors sometimes exceeded demand requirements leading to oversupply situations fluctuations in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products lead to overcapacity and contribute to cyclicality in the semiconductor market 

as many of our manufacturing costs are fixed these costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues experienced during periods in which we underutilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of overcapacity if the demand for our products is not consistent with our expectations underutilization of our manufacturing facilities may have a material adverse effect on average selling prices our gross margin and other operating results 

we may not be able to borrow funds under our credit facility or secure future financing 

we maintain a fiveyear senior credit facility with bank of america na as administrative agent and a lender and a syndicate of other lenders the “credit agreement” the credit agreement includes a 3000 million revolving credit facility which includes a 250 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a 100 million sublimit for swing line loans we may request at any time and from time to time that the revolving credit facility be increased by an amount not to exceed 1500 million the revolving credit facility is available to finance working capital capital expenditures and for other corporate purposes this facility contains various conditions covenants and representations with which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds we cannot assure that we will be in compliance with these conditions covenants and representations in the future when we may need to borrow funds under this facility 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt including our senior notes and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt which may not be successful 

in november 2015 we issued 4500 million aggregate principal amount of 675 senior notes due 2023 and 5500 million aggregate principal amount of 700 senior notes due 2025 collectively the “notes” our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations including the notes and to fund working capital planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts and any strategic alliances or acquisitions we may make in the future depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we cannot be sure that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating 

activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our debt including the notes if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt including the notes these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds sought from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due additionally the agreements governing our credit agreement and the indenture governing the notes limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition as a result we may not be allowed under these documents to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy our debt service obligations further we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity and we cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the agreements and instruments governing our debt impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility 

the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these covenants could have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete in addition the credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants operating results below current levels or other adverse factors including a significant increase in interest rates could result in our being unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in our revolving credit facility if we violate covenants under the credit agreement and are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders our debt under our revolving credit facility would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders because of crossdefault provisions in the agreements and instruments governing our debt a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under and the acceleration of our other debt if our debt is accelerated we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if we are able to obtain new financing it may not be on commercially reasonable terms on terms that are acceptable to us or at all if our debt is in default for any reason our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions 

the price of our common stock may be volatile 

the price of our common stock which is traded on the nasdaq global select market has been and may continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in addition the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate 

and cause significant price variations to occur some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we cannot assure you that the price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future in addition the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to our performance 

we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders’ ownership and cause us to incur debt and assume contingent liabilities 

as part of our business strategy we expect to continue to review potential acquisitions that could complement our current product offerings augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth or margin improvement opportunities in the event of future acquisitions of businesses products or technologies we could issue equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders ownership incur substantial debt or other financial obligations or assume contingent liabilities such actions could harm our results of operations or the price of our common stock acquisitions also entail numerous other risks that could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate key employees and our failure to do so could harm our business and our results of operations 

in order to compete effectively we must 

 



 

 

our future operating results and success depend on keeping key technical personnel and management and expanding our sales and marketing rd and administrative support we do not have employment agreements with the vast majority of our employees we must also continue to attract qualified personnel the competition for qualified personnel is intense and the number of people with experience particularly in rf engineering integrated circuits and filter design and technical marketing and support is limited we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain skilled personnel in the future 

we rely on our intellectual property portfolio and may not be able to successfully protect against the use of our intellectual property by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that patents will be issued in all countries where our products can be sold further we cannot be certain that any claims allowed from pending applications will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection against our competitors our competitors may also be able to design around our patents 

the laws of some countries in which our products are developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws this increases the possibility of piracy of our technology and products although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology additionally our competitors may be able to independently develop noninfringing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours 

we may need to engage in legal actions to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights generally intellectual property litigation is both expensive and unpredictable our involvement in intellectual property litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business these adverse effects may include injunctions exclusion orders and royalty payments to third parties 

security breaches and other similar disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

we rely on trade secrets technical knowhow and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities we try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants strategic partners and other parties we also restrict access to our proprietary information 

despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our proprietary information without our authorization additionally current departing or former employees or third parties could attempt to improperly use or access our computer systems and networks to misappropriate our proprietary information or otherwise interrupt our business like others we are also potentially subject to significant system or network disruptions including new system implementations computer viruses facility access issues and energy blackouts 

from time to time we have experienced attacks on our computer systems by unauthorized outside parties however we do not believe that such attacks have resulted in any material damage to our customers or us because the techniques used by computer hackers and others to access or sabotage networks constantly evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate counter or ameliorate all of these techniques as a result our technologies processes and customer information may be misappropriated and the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted any loss of such information could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence in the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures or cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the incident we routinely implement improvements to our network security safeguards and we are devoting increasing resources to the 

security of our information technology systems we cannot however assure that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future cyber attack or network disruptions 

we also rely on thirdparty service providers to protect our proprietary information third party service providers include foundries assembly and test contractors distributors credit card processors and other vendors that have access to our sensitive data these providers should have safeguards in place to protect our data failure of these parties to properly safeguard our data could also result in security breaches and loss of proprietary information 

the costs related to cyber or other security threats or computer systems disruptions typically would not be fully insured or indemnified by others occurrence of any of the events described above could result in loss of competitive advantages derived from our rd efforts or our ip moreover these events may result in the early obsolescence of our products adversely affect our internal operations and reputation or degrade our financial results and stock price 

if wireless devices pose safety risks we may be subject to product liability litigation and new regulations and demand for our products and those of our customers may decrease 

interest groups have requested that the federal communications commission investigate claims that wireless communications technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags hearing aids and medical devices concerns have also been expressed over and state laws have been enacted to mitigate the possibility of safety risks due to a lack of attention associated with the use of wireless devices while driving legislation that may be adopted in response to these concerns product liability litigation or other lawsuits or adverse news or findings about health and safety risks could reduce demand for our products and those of our customers any product liability litigation could result in significant expense and liability to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not the litigation is determined in our favor or covered by insurance such findings or litigation may also adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

we are subject to stringent environmental regulations 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements governing the protection of the environment these environmental regulations include those related to the use storage handling discharge and disposal of toxic or otherwise hazardous materials used in our manufacturing processes a change in environmental laws or our failure to comply with environmental laws could subject us to substantial liability or force us to significantly change our manufacturing operations in addition under some of these laws and regulations we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our properties are contaminated even if we did not cause the contamination growing concerns about climate change including the impact of global warming may result in new regulations with respect to greenhouse gas emissions our compliance with this legislation may result in additional costs 

two former production facilities at scotts valley and palo alto california from triquints acquisition of wj communications inc have significant environmental liabilities for which we have entered into and funded fixed price remediation agreements and obtained costoverrun and unknown pollution insurance coverage these arrangements may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities related to these two sites 

compliance with regulations regarding the use of “conflict minerals” could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

regulations in the united states require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products referred to as conflict minerals originated in the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries or were from recycled or scrap sources the verification and reporting requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals that are used in the manufacture of our products we have incurred costs and expect to incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements additionally we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement we may also face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider in their best interests 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying deterring preventing or rendering more difficult a change in control of qorvo that our stockholders might consider in their best interests these provisions include 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the general corporation law of the state of delaware contains provisions that regulate “business combinations” between corporations and interested stockholders who own 15 or more of the corporation’s voting stock except under certain circumstances these provisions could also discourage potential acquisition proposals and delay or prevent a change in control 

these provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit of any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context and may also make it more difficult for a third party to replace directors on our board of directors further the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 

our operating results could vary as a result of the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see  critical accounting policies and estimates  in part ii item 7 of this report such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments that could significantly affect our results of operations 

decisions we make about the scope of our future operations could affect our future financial results   

changes in the business environment could lead us to decide to change the scope of operations of our business which could result in restructuring and asset impairment charges the amount and timing of such charges can be difficult to predict factors that contribute to the amount and timing of such charges include 

 

 

 

 

changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in the us china singapore and numerous other foreign taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuations as it is impacted by a number of factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

changes in the favorable tax status of our subsidiaries in costa rica and singapore would have an adverse impact on our operating results 

our subsidiaries in costa rica and singapore have been granted tax holidays that effectively minimize our tax expense and that are expected to be effective through march 2024 and december 2021 respectively in their efforts to deal with budget deficits governments around the world are focusing on increasing tax revenues through increased audits and potentially increased tax rates for corporations as part of this effort governments continue to review their policies on granting tax holidays changes in the status of either tax holiday could have a negative effect on our net income in future years 

our management has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to accounting for income taxes if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting we may not be able to accurately report our financial results which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and the trading prices of our securities 

as disclosed in “item 9acontrols and procedures” below our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the effective monitoring and oversight of controls over the completeness existence accuracy valuation and presentation of the income tax provision including deferred tax assets valuation allowances and tax uncertainties a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

we are actively remediating the identified material weakness if our remediation efforts are insufficient to address the identified material weakness or if additional material weaknesses in our internal controls are discovered in the future they may adversely affect our ability to record process summarize and report financial information timely and accurately and as a result our financial statements may contain material misstatements or omissions which could result in regulatory scrutiny and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or the trading prices of our securities

other expense income and income taxes 



interest expense   

during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 we issued 10 billion  of notes and recognized 258 million  of related interest expense interest expense in the preceding table for fiscal 2016 is net of capitalized interest of 52 million  in fiscal 2017 we will record a full year of interest expense related to the notes of approximately 699 million which will be partially offset by interest capitalized to property and equipment interest on the notes is payable semiannually on june 1 and december 1 of each year commencing on june 1 2016 and will result in payments totaling approximately 712 million in fiscal 2017 in fiscal 2015 our 100 convertible subordinated notes due 2014 the 2014 notes became due on april 15 2014 and the remaining principal balance of 875 million plus interest of 04 million was paid with cash on hand 

other income expense 

other income expense increased for fiscal 2016 primarily due to a gain recognized from the sale of equity securities 

income taxes 

income tax expense for fiscal 2016  was 260 million  which is primarily comprised of tax expense related to international operations and tax expense of 251 million related to an increase in the valuation allowance against domestic state tax net operating loss and credit deferred tax assets and foreign net operating loss deferred tax assets offset by a tax benefit arising from domestic operations for fiscal 2016  this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 9080  

in comparison income tax benefit for fiscal 2015  was 751 million  which was primarily comprised of tax expense related to domestic and international operations offset by a tax benefit of 1358 million related to a decrease in the valuation allowance against domestic deferred tax assets for fiscal 2015  this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 619  

income tax expense for fiscal 2014  was 112 million  which was primarily comprised of tax expense related to international operations for fiscal 2014 this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 471  

a valuation allowance has been established against deferred tax assets in the taxing jurisdictions where based upon the positive and negative evidence available it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized realization is dependent upon generating future income in the taxing jurisdictions in which the operating loss carryovers credit carryovers depreciable tax basis and other tax deferred assets exist it is managements intent to reevaluate the ability to realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis as of the end of fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  the valuation allowance against domestic and foreign deferred tax assets was 347 million  138 million  and 1433 million  respectively 

the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets increased in fiscal 2016 by 209 million the increase was comprised primarily of a 202 million increase in the valuation allowance for state deferred tax assets for net operating losses and tax credits a 50 million increase in the valuation allowance for foreign net operating loss deferred tax assets and a 43 million decrease in the valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset recorded in the initial purchase price accounting for the business combination the business combination adjustment related to a deferred tax asset which was recorded during fiscal 2015 in the initial purchase price accounting with a full valuation allowance but which deferred tax asset was determined in fiscal 2016 to not exist as of the acquisition date accordingly in fiscal 2016 that deferred tax asset was removed along with the offsetting deferred tax asset valuation allowance during fiscal 2016 north carolina enacted legislation to reduce the corporate income tax rate from 5 to 4 and phasein over a threeyear period a move to a single sales factor apportionment methodology in addition the company underwent operational changes to leverage existing resources and capabilities of its singapore subsidiary and consolidate operations and responsibilities associated with its foreign backend manufacturing operations and foreign customers in that singapore subsidiary together these changes result in a significant decrease in the amount of future taxable income expected to be allocated to north carolina and the other states in which the net operating loss and credit carryovers exist as a result it is no longer more likely than not that those state net operating loss and credit carryovers for which a valuation allowance is being provided will be used before they expire the foreign net operating losses relate to the china subsidiary which owns the new internal assembly and test facility that became operational during the current fiscal year and has incurred losses since inception at the end of fiscal 2016 a 52 million valuation allowance remained against foreign net deferred tax assets and a 295 million valuation allowance remained against domestic deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized effectively increasing the domestic net deferred tax liabilities 

the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets decreased in fiscal 2015 by 1295 million the decrease was comprised of 1357 million for domestic deferred tax assets for which realization is now more likely than not with the increase in domestic deferred tax liabilities related to domestic amortizable intangible assets arising in connection with the business combination and other changes in the net deferred tax assets for foreign subsidiaries during the fiscal year offset by an increase of 62 million related to deferred tax assets acquired in the business combination which are not more likely than not of being realized at the end of fiscal 2015 a 02 million valuation allowance remained against foreign net deferred tax assets and a 136 million valuation 

allowance remained against domestic deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized effectively increasing the domestic net deferred tax liabilities 

the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets increased in fiscal 2014  by 209 million  from the 1642 million  balance as of the end of fiscal 2013 the decrease was comprised of the reversal of the 120 million uk valuation allowance established during fiscal 2013 and 151 million related to deferred tax assets used against deferred intercompany profits offset by increases related to a 34 million adjustment in the net operating losses acquired in the acquisition of amalfi semiconductor inc amalfi and 28 million for other changes in net deferred tax assets for domestic and other foreign subsidiaries during the fiscal year the uk valuation allowance was reversed in connection with the sale of the uk manufacturing facility in fiscal 2014 and the writeoff of the remaining uk deferred tax assets 

 as of april 2 2016 we had federal loss carryovers of approximately 2205 million that expire in fiscal years 2017 to 2035 if unused and state losses of approximately 1735 million that expire in fiscal years 2017 to 2035 if unused federal research credits of 943 million federal foreign tax credits of 49 million and state credits of 524 million may expire in fiscal years 2018 to 2036 2017 to 2026 and 2017 to 2031 respectively federal alternative minimum tax credits of 32 million carry forward indefinitely included in the amounts above are certain net operating losses and other tax attribute assets acquired in conjunction with the acquisitions of filtronic compound semiconductors limited sirenza microdevices inc silicon wave inc amalfi and the business combination in prior years the utilization of these acquired domestic tax assets is subject to certain annual limitations as required under internal revenue code section 382 and similar state income tax provisions 

our gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled 691 million as of april 2 2016 594 million as of march 28 2015 and 394 million as of march 29 2014 of these amounts 642 million net of federal benefit of state taxes 550 million net of federal benefit of state taxes and 309 million net of federal benefit of state taxes as of april 2 2016 march 28 2015 and march 29 2014 respectively represent the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective tax rate in each of the fiscal years 

it is our policy to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense during fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 we recognized 16 million 12 million and 09 million respectively of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits totaled 50 million 34 million and 23 million as of april 2 2016 march 28 2015 and march 29 2014 respectively within the next 12 months we believe it is reasonably possible that only a minimal amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits will be reduced as a result of reductions for tax positions taken in prior years where the only uncertainty was related to the timing of the tax deduction 

stockbased compensation 

under financial accounting standards board fasb asc 718 “compensation – stock compensation”  stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award using an option pricing model for stock options blackscholes and market price for restricted stock units and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period 

as of april 2 2016  total remaining unearned compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock units and options was 789 million  which will be amortized over the weightedaverage remaining service period of approximately 12 years  

liquidity and capital resources 

cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity as of april 2 2016  we had working capital of approximately 11354 million  including 4259 million  in cash and cash equivalents compared to working capital at march 28 2015  of 11748 million  including 2998 million  in cash and cash equivalents 

our total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 6127 million  as of april 2 2016  this balance includes approximately 2052 million  held by our foreign subsidiaries if all of these funds held by our foreign subsidiaries are needed for our operations in the us we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds we currently expect to reinvest these funds outside of the us permanently and do not expect to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

stock repurchase   

on november 5 2015 we announced that our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to 10 billion  of our outstanding common stock through november 4 2016 

on february 16 2016 we entered into variable maturity accelerated share repurchase asr agreements a 2500 million collared agreement and a 2500 million uncollared agreement with bank of america na these agreements are part of our 10 billion share repurchase program described above for the upfront payment of 5000 million we received 31 million shares of our common stock under the collared agreement representing 50 of the shares we would have repurchased assuming an average share price of 4078 and 49 million shares of our common stock under the uncollared agreement representing 80 of the shares we would have repurchased assuming an average share price of 4078 on march 10 2016 we received an additional 20 million shares of our common stock under the collared agreement final settlements of the asr agreements are expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 

in addition to the 100 million shares of our common stock that we repurchased under the asr agreements for 5000 million we repurchased 46 million shares of our common stock on the open market for 2500 million under the 10 billion share repurchase program in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 as of april 2 2016 a total of 2500 million remains authorized under this program for future repurchases 

in fiscal 2016 we also repurchased 97 million shares of our common stock for approximately 5500 million under a 2000 million program authorized in february 2015 and a 4000 million program authorized in august 2015 

cash flows from operating activities   

operating activities in fiscal 2016  provided cash of 6879 million  compared to 3056 million  in fiscal 2015  this yearoveryear increase was primarily attributable to improved profitability from the addition of triquints operations exclusive of noncash business combination expenses 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2016  was 2787 million  compared to 639 million  in fiscal 2015  this increase was due to higher capital expenditures primarily related to projects for increasing premium filter capacity as well as for manufacturing cost savings initiatives which was partially offset by increased proceeds from maturities of availableforsale securities in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 in fiscal 2015 the business combination accounted for an increase in cash provided by investing activities of approximately 2243 million 

  

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2016  was 2829 million  compared to 1129 million  in fiscal 2015  this increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the repurchase of 243 million  shares of our common stock for approximately 13000 million  which was partially offset by the net proceeds from the issuance of our notes of approximately 9878 million  during fiscal 2015 the remaining principal balance of the 2014 notes of 875 million  was paid 

our future capital requirements may differ materially from those currently anticipated and will depend on many factors including market acceptance of and demand for our products acquisition opportunities technological advances and our relationships with suppliers and customers based on current and projected levels of cash flow from operations coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents and our revolving credit facility we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet both our shortterm and longterm cash requirements however if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products or in the event that growth is faster than we had anticipated operating cash flows may be insufficient to meet our needs if existing resources and cash from operations are not sufficient to meet our future requirements or if we perceive conditions to be favorable we may seek additional debt or equity financing we cannot be sure that any additional equity or debt financing will not be dilutive to holders of our common stock further we cannot be sure that additional equity or debt financing if required will be available on favorable terms if at all 

impact of inflation 

we do not believe that the effects of inflation had a significant impact on our revenue or operating income during fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  our financial results in fiscal 2017 could be adversely affected by wage and commodity price inflation including precious metals

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to use judgment and estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management our critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies however these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report 

inventory reserves the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons generally 12 to 24 months the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory reserves are the same as those used in our revenue forecasts and are also consistent with the estimates used in our manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base market conditions and customer acceptance of our products and technologies as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost 

historically inventory reserves have fluctuated as new technologies have been introduced and customers’ demand has shifted inventory reserves had approximately a 1 or lower impact on margins in fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  

revenue recognition   net revenue is generated principally from sales of semiconductor products we recognize revenue from product sales when the fundamental criteria are met such as the time at which the title and risk and rewards of product ownership are transferred to the customer price and terms are fixed or determinable no significant vendor obligation exists and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

sales of products are generally made through either our sales force manufacturers representatives or through a distribution network revenue from the majority of our products is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer from a companyowned or thirdparty location some revenue is recognized upon receipt of the shipment by the customer we have limited rebate programs offering price protection to certain distributors these rebates represent less than 3  of net revenue and can be reasonably estimated based on specific criteria included in the rebate agreements and other known factors at the time we reduce revenue and record reserves for product returns and allowances for price protection and stock rotation based on historical experience or specific identification depending on the contractual terms of the arrangement 

we also recognize a portion of our net revenue through other agreements such as nonrecurring engineering fees contracts for rd work royalty income intellectual property ip revenue and service revenue these agreements are collectively less than 1  of consolidated revenue on an annual basis revenue from these agreements is recognized when the service is completed or upon certain milestones as provided for in the agreements 

revenue from certain contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the costs incurred to date and the total contract amount plus the contractual fee if these contracts experience cost overruns the percentage of completion method is used to determine revenue recognition revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized when the required deliverable is satisfied 

royalty income is recognized based on a percentage of sales of the relevant product reported by licensees during the period 

in addition we license or sell our rights to use portions of our ip portfolio which includes certain patent rights useful in the manufacture and sales of certain products ip revenue recognition is dependent on the terms of each agreement we will recognize ip revenue i upon delivery of the ip and ii if we have no substantive future obligation to perform under the arrangement we will defer recognition of ip revenue where future performance obligations are required to earn the revenue or the revenue is not guaranteed revenue from services is recognized during the period that the service is performed 

accounts receivable are recorded for all revenue items listed above and do not bear interest we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations subsequent to the original sale we will record an allowance against amounts due and thereby reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected for all other customers we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due industry and geographic concentrations the current business environment and our historical experience 

our terms and conditions do not give our customers a right of return associated with the original sale of our products however we will authorize sales returns under certain circumstances which include perceived quality problems courtesy returns and likekind exchanges we evaluate our estimate of returns by analyzing all types of returns and the timing of such returns in relation to the original sale reserves are adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated returns versus the original sale of product 

goodwill and intangible assets   goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for a business exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired intangibles are recorded when such assets are acquired by purchase or license the value of our intangibles including goodwill could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results ii a decline in the value of technology company stocks including the value of our common stock iii a prolonged or more significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the semiconductor industry or iv failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results    

we account for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in accordance with the fasbs guidance which requires annual testing for impairment or whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred we perform our annual impairment tests on the first day of the fourth quarter in each fiscal year our i ndefinitelived intangible assets consist of inprocess research and development iprd 

we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment commonly referred to as step zero to determine whether further quantitative analysis for impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets is necessary in performing step zero for our impairment test we are required to make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to the following the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to our business industry and market trends and the overall future financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate we also consider recent fair value calculations of our indefinitelived intangible assets and reporting units as well as cost factors such as changes in raw materials labor or other costs if the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinitelived asset is less than its respective carrying value including goodwill then we would perform an additional quantitative analysis for goodwill this involves a twostep process the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit including its goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then the second step of the process is performed to determine the amount of impairment the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recognized for the amount the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 

for indefinitelived intangible assets the quantitative analysis compares the carrying value of the asset to its fair value and an impairment charge is recognized for the amount its carrying value exceeds its fair value determining the fair value of reporting units indefinitelived intangible assets and implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill is reliant upon estimated future revenues profitability and cash flows and consideration of market factors assumptions judgments and estimates are complex subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts although we believe the assumptions judgments and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate different assumptions judgments and estimates could materially affect our results of operations 

goodwill 

goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the expected benefit from the synergies of the business combinations generating the underlying goodwill as of   april 2 2016  our goodwill balance of   21357 million   is allocated between our mp and idp reporting units    for fiscal 2016 although there were no indicators of impairment we opted to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded to perform fair value assessments of our reporting units the first step of the quantitative impairment analysis on the first day of the fourth quarter in fiscal 2016  as the fair value of the reporting units have changed due to the business combination since the last time we performed a quantitative analysis 

in performing these quantitative assessments consistent with our historical approach we used both the income and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units the income approach involves discounting future estimated cash flows the sum of the reporting unit cash flow projections was compared to our market capitalization in a discounted cash flow framework to calculate an overall implied internal rate of return or discount rate for the company our market capitalization was adjusted to a control basis assuming a reasonable control premium which resulted in an implied discount rate this implied discount rate serves as a baseline for estimating the specific discount rate for each reporting unit 

the discount rate used is the valueweighted average of our estimated cost of equity and debt “cost of capital” derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics our weighted average cost of capital is adjusted for each reporting unit to reflect a risk factor if necessary for each reporting unit we perform sensitivity tests with respect to growth rates and discount rates used in the income approach we believe the income approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the respective reporting unit’s expected longterm operations and cash flow performance 

we considered historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates used in our analysis for fiscal 2016 the material assumptions used for the income approach were eight years of projected net cash flows and a longterm growth rate of 3 for both the mp and idp reporting units a discount rate of 15 and 16 was used for the mp and idp reporting units respectively 

in applying the market approach valuation multiples are derived from historical and projected operating data of selected guideline companies which are evaluated and adjusted if necessary based on the strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit relative to the selected guideline companies the valuation multiples are then applied to the appropriate historical andor projected operating data of the reporting unit to arrive at an indication of fair value we believe the market approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value using multiples from companies with operations and economic characteristics similar to our reporting units we weighted the results of the income approach and the results of the market approach at 50 each and for the mp and idp reporting units concluded that the fair value of the reporting units was determined to be substantially in excess of the carrying value and as such no further analysis was warranted 

under the income approach described above the following indicates the sensitivity of key assumptions utilized in the assessment a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the fair value of the mp and idp reporting units by approximately 6600 million and 1400 million respectively while a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would have decreased the fair value of the mp and idp reporting units by approximately 5600 million and 1100 million respectively a one percentage point decrease in the longterm growth rate would have decreased the fair value of the mp and idp reporting units by approximately 2900 million and 500 million respectively while a one percentage point increase in the longterm growth rate would have increased the fair value of the mp and idp reporting units by approximately 3400 million and 700 million respectively 

in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 we completed our annual qualitative impairment assessments of goodwill which included but were not limited to the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to our business industry and market trends and the overall future financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate for both fiscal years 2015 and 2014 based on these assessments we concluded that goodwill was not impaired 

we intend to resume performing qualitative assessments in future fiscal years 

intangible assets with indefinite lives 

in fiscal 2015 as a result of the business combination we recorded iprd of 4700 million iprd was recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition as an indefinitelived intangible asset until t he completion or abandonment of the associated rd efforts or impairment the fair value of the acquired iprd was determined based on an income approach using the excess earnings method which   estimated the value of the intangible assets by discounting the future projected earnings of the 

asset to present value as of the valuation date upon completion of development acquired iprd assets are transferred to finitelived intangible assets and amortized over their useful lives during fiscal 2016 we completed and transferred into developed technology approximately 2030 million of iprd we performed a qualitative assessment of the remaining iprd during fiscal 2016 and concluded that iprd was not impaired 

see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding an impairment of assets recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 

intangible assets  with definite lives 

intangible assets are recorded when such assets are acquired by purchase or license    finitelived intangible assets consist primarily of technology licenses customer relationships developed technology a wafer supply agreement trade names and backlog resulting from business combinations and are subject to amortization 

technology licenses are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straightline basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the technology or the term of the license agreement ranging from approximately five  to eight  years 

the fair value of customer relationships acquired during fiscal years 2013 and 2015 was determined based on an income approach using the “with and without method in which the value of the asset is determined by the difference in discounted cash flows of the profitability of the company with the asset and the profitability of the company without the asset customer relationships are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life ranging from three  to ten  years 

the f air value of developed technology acquired during fiscal years 2013   and 2015 was det ermined based on an income approach using the excess earnings method which estimated the value of the intangible assets by discounting the future projected earnings of the asset to present value as of the valuation date developed technology is amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life ranging from four  to six  years 

the fair value of the wafer supply agreement was determined using the incremental income method which is a discounted cash flow method within the income approach under this method the fair value was estimated by discounting to present value the additional savings from expense reductions in operations at a discount rate to reflect the risk inherent in the wafer supply agreement as well as any tax benefits the wafer supply agreement was amortized on a units of use activity method over its useful life of approximately four  years and was fully amortized as of april 2 2016 

the fair value of trade names acquired in fiscal 2015 was determined based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method in which the value of the asset is determined by discounting the future projected cash flows generated from the trade names estimated royalties trade names are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of three  years 

the fair value of backlog acquired in fiscal 2015 was determined based on an income approach using the excess earnings method and was fully amortized as of april 2 2016 

we regularly review identified intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we originally estimated or that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable if such facts and circumstances exist we assess the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts impairments if any are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the impairment determination was made 

impairment of longlived assets   we review the carrying values of all longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under 

performance of a business significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of assets 

in making impairment determinations for longlived assets we utilize certain assumptions including but not limited to i estimations and quoted market prices of the fair market value of the assets and ii estimations of future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization length of service that the asset will be used in our operations and estimated salvage values 

stockbased compensation    stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award using an option pricing model for stock options blackscholes and market price for restricted stock units and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period the blackscholes option pricing model requires a number of assumptions including the expected lives of stock options the volatility of the public market price for our common stock and interest rates 

income taxes    in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

as part of our financial process we assess on a tax jurisdictional basis the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not likely a likelihood of less than 50 percent the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to ultimately be recoverable in this process certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the amount of income or loss in prior years the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies changes in taxable income market conditions us or international tax laws and other factors may change our judgment regarding whether we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets these changes if any may require material adjustments to the net deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding changes in the valuation allowance and net deferred tax assets 

as part of our financial process we also assess the likelihood that our tax reporting positions will ultimately be sustained to the extent it is determined it is more likely than not that a tax reporting position will ultimately not be recognized and sustained a provision for unrecognized tax benefit is provided by either reducing the applicable deferred tax asset or accruing an income tax liability our judgment regarding the sustainability of our tax reporting positions may change in the future due to changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to the related deferred tax assets or accrued income tax liabilities and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions and the amount of unrecognized tax benefits

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to seek a reduction in the potential negative earnings effects from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity prices arising from our business activities we manage these financial exposures through operational means and by using various financial instruments these practices may change as economic conditions change 

interest rates   

availableforsale securities 

we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from our investments in availableforsale securities in accordance with an investment policy approved by the audit committee of our board of directors our availableforsale securities are predominantly comprised of us governmentagency securities money market funds and corporate debt we continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of issuers with respect to our availableforsale securities as a result of this monitoring and volatility of the financial markets we adopted a more conservative investment strategy and we are currently investing in lower risk and consequently lower interestbearing investments accordingly we believe that the effects of changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of these issuers are limited and would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations however it is possible that we would be at risk if interest rates or the credit ratings of these issuers were to change unfavorably 

at april 2 2016  we held availableforsale investments with an estimated fair value of 3440 million  we do not purchase financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes our investments are classified as availableforsale securities and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income our cash and cash equivalents and investments earned an average annual interest rate of less than 1 in fiscal 2016 or approximately 21 million in interest income in fiscal 2015 our investments earned an average annual interest rate of approximately 01 or approximately 05 million in interest income we do not have any investments denominated in foreign currencies and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments 

credit agreement 

the credit agreement includes a 3000 million  revolving credit facility which includes a 250 million  sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a 100 million  sublimit for swing line loans we may request at any time and from time to time that the revolving credit facility be increased by an amount not to exceed 1500 million  the interest rates on this facility are variable however since we have no outstanding balances under the credit agreement there is no interest rate risk related to this facility as of april 2 2016  

currency exchange rates 

as a global company our results are affected by movements in currency exchange rates our exposure may increase or decrease over time as our foreign business levels fluctuate in the countries where we have operations and these changes could have a material impact on our financial results the functional currency for most of our international operations is the us dollar we have foreign operations in costa rica europe and asia and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the us our international revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars operating expenses and certain working capital items related to our foreignbased operations are in some instances denominated in the local foreign currencies and therefore are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies such as the renminbi euro pound sterling and costa rican colon if the us dollar weakens compared to the renminbi euro pound sterling costa rican colon and other currencies our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when remeasured back into us dollars we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means 

for fiscal 2016  we incurred a foreign currency loss of 07 million as compared to a loss of 02 million in fiscal 2015  which is recorded in “other income expense” 

  

our financial instrument holdings including foreign receivables cash and payables at april 2 2016  were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes in this sensitivity analysis we assumed that the change in one currencys rate relative to the us dollar would not have an effect on other currencies rates relative to the us dollar all other factors were held constant if the us dollar declined in value 10 in relation to the remeasured foreign currency instruments our net income would have decreased by approximately 16 million if the us dollar increased in value 10 in relation to the remeasured foreign currency instruments our net income would have increased by approximately 13 million 

commodity prices   

we routinely use precious metals in the manufacture of our products supplies for such commodities may from time to time become restricted or general market factors and conditions may affect the pricing of such commodities in fiscal 2015 we were able to complete process technology improvements that are replacing gold with lowercost materials to reduce this exposure we also have an active reclamation process to capture any unused gold while we continue to attempt to mitigate the risk of similar increases in commoditiesrelated costs there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully safeguard against potential shortterm and longterm commodity price fluctuations

 item 9a controls and procedures 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding our required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures our management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives 

as of the end of the period covered by this annual report the company’s management including our chief executive officer and the chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with rule 13a15 under the exchange act based on this evaluation the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer concluded that due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of april 2 2016 

however giving full consideration to the material weakness management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k present fairly in all material respects the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods disclosed in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 

b   managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by and under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of april 2 2016 based on the framework set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal controlintegrated framework 2013 “coso 2013 framework” based on this assessment management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting as of april 2 2016 was not effective because the company did not have a sufficient complement of trained resources with knowledge of the company’s financial reporting processes and internal control related to accounting for income taxes and therefore did not conduct an effective risk assessment process that evaluated changes in the regulatory environment the organization and personnel that impacted financial 

reporting processes and internal controls related to income taxes as a consequence the company did not maintain effective process level controls and monitoring activities over the completeness existence accuracy valuation and presentation of the income tax provision including deferred tax assets valuation allowances and tax uncertainties 

the control deficiencies described above resulted in immaterial misstatements in the preliminary consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended april 2 2016 related to income taxes that were corrected however these control deficiencies create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and therefore we concluded that the deficiencies represent a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as of april 2 2016 

kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and as part of its audit has issued an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting which is included in this annual report on form 10k on page 98 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

except for the material weakness described above no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act occurred during the quarter ended april 2 2016 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

markets products and applications 

we offer a broad array of amplification filtering and switching products for rf microwave and millimeterwave applications we utilize specialized substrate materials and highperformance process technologies such as gaas gan soi pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistors phemt and silicon germanium “sige” we believe many of our products offer key advantages relative to competing devices including steeper selectivity improved linearity lower distortion higher output power and poweradded efficiency as well as reduced size and weight and more precise frequency control our broad range of standard and customerspecific ics components and modules in addition to saw tcsaw and baw duplexers and filters combined with our manufacturing and design capabilities allow customers to select the specific product solution that best fulfills their technical and timetomarket requirements 

we focus on three broader end markets mobile products infrastructure and defense and aerospace 

mobile products 

the demand in the mobile products end market has evolved and accelerated over the past several years as a result of increased demand for enhanced voice and data communication capabilities users want mobile devices to provide signal quality similar to wired communication systems to be smaller and lighter to accommodate longer talk and standby time and to contain complex functionality such as digital cameras video recorders music players global positioning systems gps bluetooth ®  and internet access the most significant trend today in the mobile devices market is the growth of sophisticated smartphones and tablets these devices contain application processing capability that allows the device to be a platform for a wide variety of software applications including email calendar locationbased services webbased services music video travel aids and a multitude of games smartphones typically have power amplifiers filtering switches and antenna control solutions for voice and data communications additionally they typically work across multiple standards and frequency bands enabling multiregion access and coverage the expanding number of rf bands has increased the overall dollar content in an average smartphone by two to five times compared to a traditional voiceonly phone the increase in wireless communication traffic has resulted in congestion of the assigned frequency bands creating capacity issues for network operators in today’s cellular industry operators routinely spend billions of dollars on new spectrum which creates significant pressure to deploy handsets that can take advantage of the increased capacity as a consequence wireless communications standards are evolving and new technologies are being deployed to utilize the available spectrum more efficiently this in turn tends to increase the complexity of filtering requirements in each device mobile devices of this complexity provide new technical challenges that our products are well suited to address and we believe our mobile device strategy will meet the needs of this evolving market 

we sell multiple components and solutions for mobile phones our highperformance rf fusion™ line of integrated rf solutions solve the problems inherent in the most demanding rf applications while our versatile rf 

flex™ solutions allow our customers to target specific functionality with a flexible architecture other product types include pas and power amplifier modules “pams” rf filters duplexers switches transmit modules power amplifier  duplexer “pad” modules switch  pad modules rf power management ics diversity receive modules antenna switch modules antenna tuning and control solutions multimode multiband power amplifiers and other advanced products our products support multiple 2g 3g 4g and other communications standards across a wide frequency spectrum 

our access to various process technologies such as gaas soi saw tcsaw and baw provides our mobile device designers with flexibility to address our customers’ requirements for low noise better signal processing in congested bands greater power efficiency for longer battery life and low loss switching 

historically we have experienced seasonal fluctuations in our sales of mobile products our revenue is generally the strongest in the second and third fiscal quarters and weakest in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year 

infrastructure 

we sell products that support the transfer of voice video and data across wireless and wired infrastructure the increasing demand for applications services and the associated highspeed data for smartphones tablets computers and tvs is driving a dramatic evolution in the infrastructure that carries this data this translates to requirements for systems and components with higher frequency broader bandwidth greater linearity lower power consumption and smaller size to reduce operator complexity and capital investment systems need to cover multiple bands and modulation standards without increasing size or cost 

our products for the infrastructure end market target three main applications 

 

 

 

we offer a broad range of products for these applications including lownoise variablegain driver and power amplifiers single and dual band wireless local area network wlan modules digital and analog attenuators frequency converters vcos switches saw filters baw filters and multichip modules that integrate multiple functions 

our products are differentiated by high performance reflecting our unique gaas gan saw and baw processes combined with innovative design and packaging for example in base station applications our gaas hbt amplifiers offer differentiated low noise performance while our gan amplifiers offer high linearity and efficiency with high output power and low power consumption in optical transport networks infrastructure our modulator drivers provide a wide output voltage swing low jitter and high fidelity electrical “eye” performance for 40 and 100 gigabits per second networks 

we utilize our process and assembly technologies to achieve superior performance and integrate rf functionality at both the integrated circuit and multichip module levels the range of process technologies we can draw upon spans from 100 megahertz to 100 gigahertz low noise to high power as an example our highvoltage hbt and gan processes provide two options for addressing very high power high efficiency and high linearity applications our multichip modules utilize our highvolume assembly capabilities used in the manufacturing of our products for the mobile devices end market to achieve low cost and high quality for infrastructure applications 

we sell amplifier and rf filtering products for a number of applications that enable wireless connectivity including wifi used in consumer premises equipment and enterprise wireless access points we also sell amplifier and rf filtering products for automotive applications including automotive infotainment satellite radios radar and telematics and various industrial applications including smart energyami systems    the most basic ami systems provide a way for a utility company to measure customer usage remotely without touching or physically reading a 

meter more sophisticated ami systems have data links to major household appliances to enable measurement and control 

defense and aerospace 

our largest customers in the defense and aerospace end markets are military contractors serving the us government these prime contractors and subcontractors use our dielevel integrated circuits and discrete components mmics and multichip modules for radar electronic warfare and communications systems these programs include major shipboard airborne and battlefield radar systems as well as communications and electronic warfare applications our products are used in largescale programs with long leadtimes once a component has been designed into an enduse product for a military application the same component is generally used during the entire production life of the enduse product 

our products utilized in radars are bringing new capabilities to detect and neutralize threats against aircrews shipboard and infantry defense forces around the globe we are actively engaged with existing customers while seeking greater emerging application opportunities for example our legacy of phased array radar experience with domestic airborne fighter platforms has led to ongoing work in the multinational next generation platforms in addition we expect our products to be used in retrofits that upgrade the radars and other systems for the existing domestic fleet of fighter aircraft 

the capability to track multiple targets simultaneously is one of the key enhancements found in the new generation of fighters we are teamed with contractors in new programs to bring this type of capability to the warfighter and we also are engaged in retrofits of other tactical fighter jet programs our microwave pas provide the capability to transmit the power that is at the heart of phased array radar operation these radars consist of large element arrays composed of many individual integrated circuits in addition to supplying components for airborne and groundbased phased array radars we are engaged with prime defense contractors in the continuing development and production of radars for shipboard applications in the military communications field we supply filters amplifiers and other components for handheld and satellite communications systems in addition we use our packaging and integrated assembly expertise to speed designs facilitate multichip package evolution and deliver costeffective solutions for all types of customer needs 

our dod accreditation as a microelectronics trusted source is an assurance that our processes and procedures meet stringent quality and security controls which can permit increased levels of high securityclassified application specific integrated circuit foundry services through accreditation we join a small group of gaas suppliers certified by the dod as able to fabricate and deliver devices for applications using standards approved and monitored by the defense microelectronics activity we have also been certified by the dod as having manufacturing readiness level 9 for our gan fabrication capabilities which certifies us as having the necessary systems and demonstrated capabilities in place for rate production 

we are also directly engaged with the us government primarily through contracts with the defense advanced research project agency the air force research laboratory and the office of naval research to develop the next generation of rf components in gan and gaas gan high electron mobility transistor devices provide the higher power density and efficiency required for future highpower phased array radar electronic warfare missile seekers and communications systems through these programs and other ongoing efforts we continue to enhance the reliability and manufacturability of our gan processes 

revenue from the sales of our products in the defense and aerospace end market can fluctuate significantly from year to year due to the timing of programs 

manufacturing 

we have a global supply chain that routinely ships millions of units per day our products have varying degrees of complexity and rely on semiconductors and other components that are manufactured inhouse or outsourced the majority of our products are multichip modules utilizing multiple semiconductor process technologies we are a leading supplier of rf solutions and a leading manufacturer of compound semiconductors including gaas hbt gaas phemt gan saw tcsaw and baw for rf applications 

we operate wafer fabrication facilities for the production of gaas gan saw tcsaw and baw wafers in greensboro north carolina hillsboro oregon richardson texas apopka florida and bend oregon we also 

use multiple siliconbased process technologies including soi and cmos in our products we outsource all silicon manufacturing to leading silicon foundries 

we have our own copper bumping and wlp technologies and also use external suppliers for these technologies in packages that employ bumped die the electrical connections are created directly on the surface of the die which eliminates wirebonds so that the die may be attached directly to a substrate or leadframe this type of technology provides a higher density interconnection capability than wirebonded die and enables smaller and thinner form factors we use wlp technologies for our saw tcsaw and baw products 

once the semiconductor manufacturing is complete the wafers are singulated or separated into individual units called die for the majority of our products the next step in our manufacturing process is assembly during assembly the die and other necessary components are placed on a high density interconnect substrate to provide connectivity between the die and the components this populated substrate is formed into a microelectronic package once assembled the products are tested for rf performance and prepared for shipment through a tape and reel process to assemble and test our products we primarily use internal assembly facilities in the united states china costa rica and germany and we also utilize several external suppliers 

the fabrication of ics and filter products in these facilities is highly complex and sensitive to particles and other contaminants and requires production in a highly controlled clean environment minute impurities difficulties in the fabrication process or defects in the masks used to transfer circuits onto the wafers can cause a substantial percentage of the wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional the more brittle nature of gaas wafers can also lead to more wafer breakages than experienced with silicon wafers to maximize wafer yield and quality we test our products in various stages in the fabrication process maintain continuous reliability monitoring and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow our manufacturing yields vary significantly among our products depending upon a given product’s complexity and our manufacturing experience 

we incur a high level of fixed costs to operate our own manufacturing facilities these fixed costs consist primarily of facility occupancy costs repair maintenance and depreciation costs related to manufacturing equipment and fixed labor costs related to manufacturing and process engineering 

our quality management system is registered to iso 9001 standards and our environmental management system is registered to iso 140012004 this means that a thirdparty independent auditor has determined that these systems meet the requirements developed by the international organization of standardization a nongovernmental network of the national standards institutes of over 150 countries the iso 9001 standards provide models for quality assurance in designdevelopment production installation and servicing the iso 140012004 standards provide a structure within which a company can develop or strengthen its quality system for managing its environmental affairs we believe that all of our key vendors and suppliers are compliant with applicable iso 9001 andor ts16949 standards which means that their operations have in each case been determined by auditors to comply with certain internationally developed quality control standards we qualify and monitor assembly contractors based on cost and quality 

our manufacturing facilities in greensboro north carolina hillsboro oregon richardson texas and apopka florida are certified to isots 16949 standards which is the highest international quality standard for the automotive industry and incorporates iso technical specifications that are more stringent than iso 9001 quality management systems requirements the isots 16949 standard combines north american and european automotive requirements and serves the global automotive market 

raw materials 

we purchase numerous raw materials passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing processes we use independent foundries to supply all of our siliconbased integrated circuits high demand for soi wafers to support manufacture of our switch products has led to supply constraints in the past which we are addressing by qualifying new silicon foundries and securing supply commitments from existing silicon suppliers 

for our acoustic filter manufacturing operations we use several raw materials including wafers made from quartz silicon lithium niobate “linbo 3 ” or lithium tantalite “litao 3 ” as well as ceramic or metal packages relatively 

few companies produce these raw materials our most significant suppliers of ceramic surface mount packages are based in japan for our saw operations we also utilize multiple qualified wafer and mask set vendors 

our manufacturing strategy includes a balance of internal and external sites primarily for assembly operations which helps reduce costs provides flexibility of supply and minimizes the risk of supply disruption we routinely qualify multiple sources of supply and manufacturing sites to reduce the risk of supply interruptions or price increases and closely monitor suppliers’ key performance indicators our suppliers and our manufacturing sites are geographically diversified with our largest volume sources distributed throughout southern and eastern asia and we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing needs 

customers 

we design develop manufacture and market our products to leading us and international oems and odms we are also engaged with leading baseband reference design partners located primarily in the us and china 

some of our mp customers use multiple contract manufacturers for product assembly and test therefore revenue for one customer may not necessarily represent the entire business of a single mobile products manufacturer we sold our products to our largest end customer through multiple contract manufacturers which in the aggregate accounted for approximately 32 20 and 9 of total revenue in fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively samsung electronics co ltd accounted for approximately 14  25  and 22 of our total revenue in fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the majority of the revenue from these customers was from our mobile product sales no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue 

some of our sales to overseas customers are made under export licenses that must be obtained from the us department of commerce 

information about revenue operating profit or loss and total assets is presented in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

sales and marketing 

we sell our products worldwide directly to customers as well as through a network of domestic and foreign sales representative firms and distributors we select our domestic and foreign sales representatives based on technical skills and sales experience as well as the presence of complementary product lines and the customer base served we provide ongoing training to our internal as well as our external sales representatives and distributors to keep them informed of and educated about our products we maintain an internal sales and marketing organization that is responsible for key account management application engineering support to customers developing sales and advertising literature and preparing technical presentations for industry conferences we have sales and customer support centers located throughout the world 

we maintain an extensive website containing product information and publish a comprehensive product selection guide annually our global team of application engineers interacts with customers during all stages of design and production provides customers with product application notes and engineering data maintains regular contact with customer engineers and assists in the resolution of technical problems we believe that maintaining a close relationship with customers and platform providers and providing them with strong technical support enhances their level of satisfaction and enables us to anticipate their future product needs 

research and development 

our research and development activities enable the technologies and products necessary to maintain our leadership in the end markets we serve our rd activities are focused on improving the performance size and cost of our products in our customers’ systems we focus on both continuous improvement in our processes for design and manufacture as well as innovation in fundamental research areas such as materials simulation and modeling circuit design device packaging and test we maintain an extensive patent portfolio and also protect much of our intellectual property in the form of trade secrets 

we have developed several generations of gaas gan baw and saw process technologies that we manufacture internally we invest in these technologies to improve device performance reduce die size and reduce manufacturing costs we also develop and qualify technologies made available to us from key suppliers including soi for switches and rf signal conditioning solutions and sige and indium phosphide inp for amplifiers we combine these external technologies with our own proprietary design methods intellectual property and other expertise to improve performance increase integration and reduce the size and cost of our products 

our rf systemslevel expertise and our innovations in new product architectures new circuit techniques filtering and other new proprietary technologies are enabling us to solve the increasingly complex rf challenges related to linearity power consumption and other critical performance metrics this is evident in our line of high performance rf fusion™ and versatile rf flex™ integrated modules 

qorvo is a pioneer in envelope tracking technology for wireless applications and we are incorporating our et technology into power management components and our most advanced pas our et technology enables us to track the envelope of highspeed modulation signals and adjust the pa in real time to maximize efficiency and maintain required levels of linearity this technology is increasingly necessary to maximize mobile device data rates and meet user expectations for battery life and maximum case temperatures because our customers often use a variety of baseband and power management chipsets we also develop pas that demonstrate industryleading performance with thirdparty power management components 

we continue to develop and release new ganbased products and invest in new gan process technologies to exploit gans performance advantages across existing and new product categories the inherent wide band gap high electron mobility and high breakdown voltage characteristics of gan semiconductor devices offer significant performance advantages versus competing technologies we are also developing other advanced gan process technologies that target applications where we anticipate gan devices will provide a disruptive performance advantage and deliver meaningful energy savings in endmarket products 

in the area of packaging technologies we are developing and qualifying packaging technologies that allow us to improve performance and reduce the area and height of our products we are continuing to invest in packaging technologies such as wlp and copper pillar bump that eliminate wire bonds reduce the size and component height and improve performance while reducing the cost of packaging our products in addition we are investing in large scale module assembly and test capabilities to bring these technologies to market in very high volumes 

in fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 we incurred approximately 2575 million 1973 million and 1788 million respectively in research and development expenses we expect to continue to spend substantial funds on rd in support of our growth and product diversification goals 

competition 

we operate in a very competitive industry characterized by rapid advances in technology and new product introductions our customers product life cycles are short and our competitiveness depends on our ability to improve our products and processes faster than our competitors anticipate changing customer requirements and successfully develop and launch new products while reducing our costs our competitiveness is also affected by the quality of our customer service and technical support and our ability to design customized products that address each customers particular requirements within the customers cost limitations the selection process for our products to be included in our customers new products is highly competitive and our customers provide no guarantees that our products will be included in the next generation of products introduced 

we compete primarily with the following companies anadigics inc analog devices inc avago inc macom technology solutions inc murata manufacturing co ltd qualcomm technologies inc raytheon company skyworks solutions inc sumitomo electric device innovations and tdkepcos corporation 

many of our current and potential competitors have entrenched market positions and customer relationships established patents and other intellectual property and substantial technological capabilities in some cases our competitors are also our customers or suppliers additionally many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing and marketing resources than we do which may allow them to implement new technologies and develop new products more quickly than we can 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets is important to our business and we actively seek opportunities to leverage our intellectual property portfolio to promote our business interests moreover we respect the intellectual property rights of others and have implemented policies and procedures to mitigate the risk of infringing or misappropriating third party intellectual property 

patent applications are filed within the us and in other countries where we have a market presence on occasion some applications do not mature into patents for various reasons including rejections based on prior art in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws we have approximately 1000 patents that expire from 2015 to 2035   we also continue to acquire patents through acquisitions or direct prosecution efforts and engage in licensing transactions to secure the right to practice third parties’ patents in view of the relatively short market life of many of our products we believe the duration and scope of our most relevant patents are sufficient to support our business 

we periodically register federal trademarks service marks and trade names that distinguish our product brand names in the market we also monitor these marks for their proper and intended use 

we also rely on nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our interest in confidential and proprietary information including business strategies unpatented inventions designs and process technology such information is closely monitored and made available only to those employees whose responsibilities require access to the information

our sales are the result of standard purchase orders or specific agreements with customers we maintain qorvoowned finished goods inventory at certain customers’ “hub” locations and do not recognize revenue until our customers draw down the inventory at these hubs our customers’ projections of consumption of hub inventory and quantities on purchase orders as well as the shipment schedules are frequently revised within agreedupon lead times to reflect changes in the customers’ needs because industry practice allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment and with little or no penalty we believe that backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels 

employees 

on march 28 2015 we had approximately 6700 employees we believe that our future prospects will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain skilled employees competition for skilled personnel is intense and the number of persons with relevant experience particularly in rf engineering product design and technical marketing is limited none of our us employees are represented by a labor union a number of our europeanbased employees less than 5 of our global workforce as of march 28 2015 are subject to collective bargainingtype arrangements we have never experienced any work stoppage and we believe that our current employee relations are good 

geographic financial summary 

a summary of our operations by geographic area is as follows in thousands 



sales for geographic disclosure purposes are based on the “sold to” address of the customer the “sold to” address is not always an accurate representation of the location of final consumption of our products of our total revenue for fiscal 2015  approximately 49   8410 million  was attributable to customers in china and approximately 19   3325 million  was attributable to customers in taiwan 

longlived tangible assets primarily include property and equipment at march 28 2015  approximately 1265 million  or 14  of our total property and equipment was located in china

for a summary of certain risks associated with our foreign operations see item 1a “risk factors” 

  

environmental matters 

by virtue of operating our wafer fabrication facilities we are subject to a variety of extensive and changing federal state and local governmental laws regulations and ordinances related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in the manufacturing process we provide our own manufacturing waste water treatment and disposal for most of our manufacturing facilities and have contracted for the disposal of hazardous waste state agencies require us to report usage of environmentally hazardous materials and we have retained appropriate personnel to help ensure compliance with all applicable environmental regulations we believe that costs arising from existing environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

we are an iso 140012004 certified manufacturer with a comprehensive environmental management system “ems” in place in order to help ensure control of the environmental aspects of the manufacturing process our ems mandates compliance and establishes appropriate checks and balances to minimize the potential for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations 

we actively monitor the hazardous materials that are used in the manufacture assembly and testing of our products particularly materials that are retained in the final product we have developed specific restrictions on the content of certain hazardous materials in our products as well as those of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers and subcontractors this helps to ensure that our products are compliant with the requirements of the markets into which the products will be sold for example our products are compliant with the european union rohs directive 201165eu on the restriction of use of hazardous substances which prohibits the sale in the european union market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing certain families of substances above a specified threshold 

we do not currently anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for the remainder of fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2017

 item 1a risk factors 

our operating results fluctuate 

our revenue earnings margins and other operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future if demand for our products fluctuates as a result of economic conditions or for other reasons our revenue and profitability could be impacted our future operating results will depend on many factors including but not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is likely that our future operating results could be adversely affected by one or more of the factors set forth above or other similar factors if our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market analysts or our investors our stock price may decline 

our industrys technology changes rapidly 

we primarily design and manufacture highperformance semiconductor components for wireless applications our markets are characterized by the frequent introduction of new products in response to evolving product and process technologies and consumer demand for greater functionality lower costs smaller products and better performance as a result we have experienced and will continue to experience some product design obsolescence we expect our customers demands for reductions in cost and improvements in product performance to continue which means that we must continue to improve our product designs and develop new products that may use new technologies it is possible that competing technologies will emerge that permit the manufacture of products that are equivalent or acceptable in terms of performance but lower in cost to the products we make under existing processes if we cannot design products using competitive technologies or develop competitive products our operating results will be adversely affected 

our operating results are at risk if we do not introduce new products and decrease costs   

the average selling prices of our products have historically decreased over the products lives and we expect this to continue to offset these average selling price decreases we must achieve yield improvements and other cost reductions for existing products and introduce new products that can be manufactured at lower costs in highertier performancedriven markets we offer solutions that deliver the advantages of superior performance in lowertier costdriven markets we offer solutions that deliver market acceptable performance at lower cost if we do not continue to identify markets that require superior performance and offer products that command a premium price for such performance or if we do not achieve market acceptable performance in our products for costdriven markets our operating results could be adversely affected 

we depend on a few large customers for a substantial portion of our revenue 

a substantial portion of our mp revenue comes from large purchases by a small number of customers our future operating results depend on both the success of our largest customers and on our success in diversifying our products and customer base 

we typically manufacture custom products on an exclusive basis for individual customers for a negotiated period of time increasingly the largest cellular handset oems are releasing fewer new phone models on an annual basis which heightens the importance of achieving design wins for these larger opportunities while the rewards for a design win are financially greater competition for these projects is intense the concentration of our revenue with a relatively small number of customers makes us particularly dependent on factors affecting those customers for example if demand for their products decreases they may stop purchasing our products and our operating results would suffer most of our customers can cease incorporating our products into their products with little notice to us and with little or no penalty the loss of a large customer and failure to add new customers to replace lost revenue would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face risks of a loss of revenue if contracts with the us government or defense and aerospace contractors are canceled or delayed 

we receive a portion of our revenue from the us government and from prime contractors on us government sponsored programs principally for defense and aerospace applications these programs such as the defense advanced research project agency darpa contract to develop high power wide band amplifiers in gan the next program to explore advanced and promising new gan technology and the f35 lightning jsf aircraft programs generally have long lead times these programs are also subject to delays or cancellation further spending on defense and aerospace contracts can vary significantly depending on funding from the us government we believe our government and defense and aerospace contracts in the recent past have been negatively affected by external factors such as sequestration and political pressure to reduce federal defense spending reductions in defense and aerospace funding or the loss of a significant defense and aerospace program or contract would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we operate in a very competitive industry and must continue to implement innovative technologies 

we compete with several companies primarily engaged in the business of designing manufacturing and selling rf solutions as well as suppliers of discrete integrated circuits in addition to our direct competitors some of our largest customers and leading platform partners also compete with us to some extent by designing and manufacturing their own products increased competition from any source could adversely affect our operating results through lower prices for our products reduced demand for our products and a corresponding reduction in our ability to recover development engineering and manufacturing costs 

many of our existing and potential competitors have entrenched market positions historical affiliations with oems considerable internal manufacturing capacity established ip rights and substantial technological capabilities many of our existing and potential competitors may have greater financial technical manufacturing or marketing resources than we do we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully with our competitors 

our operating results are substantially dependent on development of new products and achieving design wins   

our future success will depend on our ability to develop new product solutions for existing and new markets we must introduce new products in a timely and costeffective manner and secure production orders from our customers the development of new products is a highly complex process and we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products at times in the past our successful product development depends on a number of factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to design and introduce new products in a timely or costefficient manner and our new products may fail to meet the requirements of the market or our customers in that case we likely will not reach the expected level of production orders which could adversely affect our operating results even when a design win is achieved our success is not assured design wins may require significant expenditures by us and typically precede volume revenue by six to nine months or more many customers seek a second source for all major components in their devices which can significantly impact the revenue obtained from a design win the actual value of a design win to us will ultimately depend on the commercial success of our customer’s product 

decisions about the scope of operations of our business could affect our results of operations and financial condition     

changes in the business environment could lead to changes in our decisions about the scope of operations of our business and these changes could result in restructuring and asset impairment charges factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations with regard to changing the scope of our operations include     

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we face risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing facilities 

we operate wafer fabrication facilities in florida north carolina oregon and texas we currently use several international and domestic assembly suppliers as well as internal assembly facilities in the us china costa rica   the philippines and germany to assemble and test our products we currently have our own test and tape and reel facilities located in the us china costa rica and the philippines and we also utilize contract suppliers and partners in asia to test our products 

a number of factors will affect the future success of our facilities including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change we carry commercial property damage and business interruption insurance against various risks with limits deemed adequate for reimbursement for damage to our fixed assets and resulting disruption of operations however the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and increase our costs and expenses our operations could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues any disruptions from these or other natural disasters could require substantial 

expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations and have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results to the extent that losses exceed insurance recoveries 

if we experience poor manufacturing yields our operating results may suffer 

our products are very complex each product has a unique design and is fabricated using semiconductor process technologies that are highly complex in many cases the products are assembled in customized packages our products many of which consist of multiple components in a single package feature enhanced levels of integration and complexity our customers insist that our products be designed to meet their exact specifications for quality performance and reliability our manufacturing yield is a combination of yields across the entire supply chain including wafer fabrication assembly and test yields due to the complexity of our products we periodically experience difficulties in achieving acceptable yields on certain new and existing products 

our customers also test our components once they have been assembled into their products the number of usable products that result from our production process can fluctuate as a result of many factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we constantly seek to improve our manufacturing yields typically for a given level of sales when our yields improve our gross margins improve and when our yields decrease our unit costs are higher our margins are lower and our operating results are adversely affected 

costs of product defects and errata deviations from published specifications could include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these costs could be significant and may increase expenses and lower gross margin our reputation with customers could be damaged as a result of product defects and errata and product demand could be reduced these factors could harm our business and financial results 

industry overcapacity and current macroeconomic conditions could cause us to underutilize our manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

it is difficult to predict future growth or decline in the demand for our products which makes it very difficult to estimate requirements for production capacity in prior fiscal years we have added significant capacity through acquisitions as well as by expanding capacity at our existing manufacturing facilities 

in the past capacity additions by us and our competitors sometimes exceeded demand requirements leading to oversupply situations fluctuations in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products contribute to cyclicality in the semiconductor market this may in the future put pressure on our average selling prices and have a material adverse effect on us 

as many of our manufacturing costs are fixed these costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues experienced during periods in which we underutilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand if the demand for our products is not consistent with our expectations underutilization of our manufacturing facilities may have a material adverse effect on our gross margin and other operating results 

we are subject to increased inventory risks and costs because we build our products based on forecasts provided by customers before receiving purchase orders for the products 

in order to ensure availability of our products for some of our largest customers we start manufacturing certain products in advance of receiving purchase orders based on forecasts provided by these customers however these forecasts do not represent binding purchase commitments and we do not recognize sales for these products until they are shipped to or consumed by the customer as a result we incur significant inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales because demand for our products may not materialize manufacturing based on forecasts subjects us to increased risks of high inventory carrying costs increased obsolescence and increased operating costs these inventory risks are exacerbated when our customers purchase indirectly through contract manufacturers or hold component inventory levels greater than their consumption rate because this reduces our visibility regarding the customers accumulated levels of inventory if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to writeoff inventory which would have a negative impact on our gross margin and other operating results 

we depend heavily on third parties 

we purchase numerous component parts substrates and siliconbased products from external suppliers we also utilize thirdparty suppliers for numerous services including die processing wafer bumping test and tape and reel the use of external suppliers involves a number of risks including the possibility of material disruptions in the supply of key components and the lack of control over delivery schedules capacity constraints manufacturing yields quality and fabrication costs 

we currently use several external manufacturing suppliers to supplement our internal manufacturing capabilities we believe all of our key vendors and suppliers are compliant with applicable iso 9001 andor ts16949 standards however if these vendors processes vary in reliability or quality they could negatively affect our products and therefore our results of operations 

we increasingly sell certain of our products through platform providers and our inability to manage these evolving relationships may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are focused on developing and maintaining relationships with platform providers to help us sell our products these platform providers are typically large companies that provide system reference designs for oems and odms that include the platform providers baseband and other complementary products certain platform providers own or control ip that provides them with a dominant market position for their baseband products for certain air interface standards which provides them with significant influence and control over sales of rf products for these standards platform providers have historically looked to us and our competitors to provide rf products to their customers as part of the overall system design and we must compete to have our rf products included in the platform providers system reference design our relationships with certain platform providers are evolving particularly as they work to develop more fully integrated solutions in silicon that include their own rf technologies and components 

in platform provider relationships we generally do not control the end customer relationship as a result we are dependent upon the platform provider as the prime contractor to appropriately manage the end customer the failure of the platform provider to do so can lead to situations where projects are delayed modified or terminated for reasons outside our control 

platform providers may be in a different business from ours or we may be their customer or competitor accordingly we must balance our interest in obtaining new business with competitive and other factors because platform providers control the overall system reference design if they offer competitive rf technologies or their own rf solutions as a part of their reference design and exclude our products from the design we are at a distinct competitive disadvantage with oems and odms that are seeking a turnkey design solution even if our products offer superior performance 

our relationships with platform providers are complex and evolving and inability to manage these relationships could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to risks from international sales and operations 

we operate globally with sales offices and research and development activities as well as manufacturing assembly and testing facilities in multiple countries as a result we are subject to regulatory geopolitical and other risks associated with doing business outside the us global operations involve inherent risks that include currency controls and fluctuations as well as tariff import and other related restrictions and regulations 

sales to customers located outside the us accounted for approximately 82  of our revenue in fiscal 2015 we expect that revenue from international sales will continue to be a significant part of our total revenue because the majority of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars our products become less pricecompetitive in countries with currencies that are low or are declining in value against the us dollar also we cannot be sure that our international customers will continue to accept orders denominated in us dollars 

the majority of our assembly test and tape and reel vendors are located in asia we do the majority of our business with our foreign assemblers in us dollars our manufacturing costs could increase in countries with currencies that are increasing in value against the us dollar also we cannot be sure that our international manufacturing suppliers will continue to accept orders denominated in us dollars 

in addition if terrorist activity armed conflict civil or military unrest or political instability occur in the us or other locations such events may disrupt manufacturing assembly logistics security and communications and could also result in reduced demand for our products pandemics and similar major health concerns could also adversely affect our business and our customer order patterns we could also be affected if labor issues disrupt our transportation or manufacturing arrangements or those of our customers or suppliers on a worldwide basis we regularly review our key infrastructure systems services and suppliers both internally and externally to seek to identify significant vulnerabilities as well as areas of potential business impact if a disruptive event were to occur once identified we assess the risks and as we consider it to be appropriate we initiate actions intended to minimize the risks and their potential impact however there can be no assurance that we have identified all significant risks or that we can mitigate all identified risks with reasonable effort 

a slowdown in the chinese economy could limit the growth in demand for devices containing our products which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and prospects 

we believe that an increase in demand in china for handsets and other devices that include our products will be an important factor in our future growth although the chinese economy has grown significantly in recent years there can be no assurance that such growth will continue any weakness in the chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for devices containing our products which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and prospects 

economic regulation in china could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we have a significant portion of our assembly and testing capacity in china in recent years the chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation in response to these factors the chinese government has from time to time adopted measures to regulate growth and contain inflation 

including measures designed to restrict credit or to control prices such actions in the future could increase the cost of doing business in china or decrease the demand for our products in china which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate key employees and our failure to do so could harm our results of operations 

in order to compete we must 

 

 

 

 

our future operating results and success depend on keeping key technical personnel and management and expanding our sales and marketing research and development and administrative support we do not have employment agreements with the vast majority of our employees we must also continue to attract qualified personnel the competition for qualified personnel is intense and the number of people with experience particularly in rf engineering integrated circuits and filter design and technical marketing and support is limited we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain other skilled personnel in the future 

our operating results may be adversely impacted by the inability of certain of our customers to access their traditional sources of credit to finance the purchase of products from us which could lead them to reduce their level of purchases or seek credit or other accommodations from us 

the inability of our customers to access capital efficiently could cause disruptions in their businesses thereby negatively impacting ours for example if our customers do not have sufficient liquidity they could reduce or limit new purchases which could result in lower demand for our products or place us at risk for any trade credit we have extended to them if they are unable to repay us this risk may increase if a general economic downturn materially impacts our customers and they are not able to manage their business risks adequately or do not properly disclose their financial condition to us 

difficulties in integrating the business of rfmd and triquint and a failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination including the expected amount and timing of cost savings and operating synergies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and our stock price 

the success of the business combination will depend in part on our ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits from the transaction including increased revenue synergies cost savings and operational efficiencies if we are unable to fully achieve these objectives within a reasonable amount of time the anticipated benefits may not be fully realized or at all or may take longer to fully realize than expected and the value of our common stock may decline 

the combination of rfmd’s business and triquint’s business has been and will continue to be a complex costly and timeconsuming process the ongoing integration of the two companies has resulted and may continue to result in challenges including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenue and diversion of management’s time and energy delays or issues encountered in the ongoing integration process could have a material adverse effect on our revenue expenses operating results and financial condition and no assurance can be given that we will fully realize these anticipated benefits 

further we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in connection with the integration process the substantial majority of these costs are nonrecurring expenses related to the facilities and systems consolidation costs we may also incur other unanticipated integration costs as well as costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees and additional costs related to formulating and revising integration plans 

if we are unable to fully achieve the expected growth in earnings or if our operational cost savings estimates are not fully realized or if the integration costs are greater than expected the market price of our common stock may decline the market price also may decline if we do not fully achieve the perceived benefits of the business combination as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or if our financial results are not consistent with their expectations 

we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders’ ownership and cause us to incur debt and assume contingent liabilities 

as part of our business strategy we expect to continue to review potential acquisitions that could complement our current product offerings augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth or margin improvement opportunities in the event of future acquisitions of businesses products or technologies we could issue equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders ownership incur substantial debt or other financial obligations or assume contingent liabilities such actions could harm our results of operations or the price of our common stock acquisitions also entail numerous other risks that could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the price of our common stock may be volatile 

the price of our common stock which is traded on the nasdaq global select market may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in addition the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include 

 24 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we cannot assure you that the price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future in addition the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to our performance 

we rely on our intellectual property portfolio and may face claims of infringement 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that patents will be issued in all countries where our products can be sold further we cannot be certain that any claims allowed from pending applications will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection against our competitors our competitors may also be able to design around our patents 

the laws of some countries in which our products are developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws this increases the possibility of piracy of our technology and products although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology additionally our competitors may be able to independently develop noninfringing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours 

we may need to engage in legal actions to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights generally intellectual property litigation is both expensive and unpredictable our involvement in intellectual property litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business these adverse effects may include injunctions exclusion orders and royalty payments to third parties 

security breaches and other similar disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

we rely on trade secrets technical knowhow and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities we try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants strategic partners and other parties we also restrict access to our proprietary information 

despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our proprietary information without our authorization additionally current departing or former employees or third parties could attempt to improperly use or access our computer systems and networks to misappropriate our proprietary information or otherwise interrupt our business like others we are also potentially subject to significant system or network disruptions including new system implementations computer viruses facility access issues and energy blackouts 

from time to time we have experienced attacks on our computer systems by unauthorized outside parties however we do not believe that such attacks have resulted in any material damage to our customers or us because the techniques used by computer hackers and others to access or sabotage networks constantly evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate counter or ameliorate all of these techniques as a result our technologies and processes may be misappropriated and the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted any loss of such information could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence in the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures or cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the incident we routinely implement improvements to our network security safeguards and we are devoting increasing resources to the security of our information technology systems we cannot however assure that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future cyber attack or network disruptions 

we also rely on thirdparty service providers to protect our proprietary information third party service providers include foundries assembly and test contractors distributors credit card processors and other vendors that have access to our sensitive data these providers should have safeguards in place to protect our data failure of these parties to properly safeguard our data could also result in security breaches and loss of proprietary information 

the costs related to cyber or other security threats or computer systems disruptions typically would not be fully insured or indemnified by others occurrence of any of the events described above could result in loss of competitive advantages derived from our research and development efforts or our ip moreover these events may result in the early obsolescence of our products adversely affect our internal operations and reputation or degrade our financial results and stock price 

we may be subject to lawsuits and claims relating to our products 

third parties could assert product liability or other claims against us our customers or our licensors with respect to existing and future products any litigation could result in significant expense and liability to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not the litigation is determined in our favor or covered by insurance 

if wireless devices pose safety risks we may be subject to new regulations and demand for our products and those of our customers may decrease   

concerns over the effects of radio frequency emissions continue interest groups have requested that the federal communications commission investigate claims that wireless communications technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags hearing aids and medical devices concerns have also been expressed over and state laws have been enacted to mitigate the possibility of safety risks due to a lack of attention associated with the use of wireless devices while driving legislation that may be adopted in response to these concerns or adverse news or findings about safety risks could reduce demand for our products and those of our customers in the us as well as in foreign countries 

we are subject to stringent environmental regulations 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements governing the protection of the environment these environmental regulations include those related to the use storage handling discharge and disposal of toxic or otherwise hazardous materials used in our manufacturing processes a change in environmental laws or our failure to comply with environmental laws could subject us to substantial liability or force us to significantly change our manufacturing operations in addition under some of these laws and regulations we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our properties are contaminated even if we did not cause the contamination growing concerns about climate change including the impact of global warming may result in new regulations with respect to greenhouse gas emissions our compliance with this legislation may result in additional costs 

two former production facilities at scotts valley and palo alto california from triquints acquisition of wj communications inc have significant environmental liabilities for which we have entered into and funded fixed price remediation agreements and obtained costoverrun and unknown pollution insurance coverage these arrangements may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities related to these two sites 

compliance with regulations regarding the use of “conflict minerals” could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products   

regulations in the united states require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products referred to as conflict minerals originated in the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries or were from recycled or scrap sources the verification and reporting requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals that are used in the manufacture of our products we have incurred costs and expect to incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements additionally we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement we may also face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the general corporation law of the state of delaware may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider in their best interests 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying deterring preventing or rendering more difficult a change in control of qorvo that our stockholders might consider in their best interests these provisions include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the general corporation law of the state of delaware contains provisions that regulate “business combinations” between corporations and interested stockholders who own 15 or more of the corporation’s voting stock except under certain circumstances these provisions could also discourage potential acquisition proposals and delay or prevent a change in control 

these provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit of any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context and may also make it more difficult for a third party to replace directors on our board of directors further the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 

our operating results could vary as a result of the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see  critical accounting policies and estimates  in part ii item 7 of this report such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments that could significantly affect our results of operations 

we may not be able to borrow funds under our credit facility or secure future financing 

on april 7 2015 we entered into a fiveyear senior credit facility with bank of america na as administrative agent and a lender and a syndicate of other lenders the “credit agreement” the credit agreement includes a 300 million revolving credit facility which includes a 25 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a 10 million sublimit for swing line loans we may request at any time and from time to time that the revolving credit facility be increased by an amount not to exceed 150 million the revolving credit facility is available to finance working capital capital expenditures and for other lawful corporate purposes this facility contains various conditions covenants and representations with which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds we cannot assure that we will be in compliance with these conditions covenants and representations in the future when we may need to borrow funds under this facility 

changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in the us china singapore and numerous other foreign taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuations as it is impacted by a number of factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

changes in the favorable tax status of our subsidiaries in costa rica and singapore would have an adverse impact on our operating results 

our subsidiaries in costa rica and singapore have been granted tax holidays that effectively minimize our tax expense and that are expected to be effective through march 2024 and december 2021 respectively in their efforts to deal with budget deficits governments around the world are focusing on increasing tax revenues through increased audits and potentially increased tax rates for corporations as part of this effort governments continue to review their policies on granting tax holidays changes in the status of either tax holiday could have a negative effect on our net income in future years

other expense income and income taxes 



interest expense   

interest expense has decreased as a result of lower debt balances our 2014 notes became due on april 15 2014 and the remaining principal balance of 875 million plus interest of 04 million was paid with cash on hand during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 our 075 convertible subordinated notes due 2012 became due and we paid the remaining principal balance of 265 million  during fiscal 2013 we purchased and retired 474 million  original principal amount of our 2014 notes 

loss on the retirement of convertible subordinated notes   

the remaining principal balance of our 2014 notes was retired in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 during fiscal 2014 we did not purchase and retire any of our 2014 notes during fiscal 2013 we purchased and retired 474 million  original principal amount of our 2014 notes for an average price of 9834  which resulted in a loss of 28 million  as a result of applying financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc 47020 

other income expense 

in fiscal 2015 we incurred a foreign currency loss of 02 million as compared to a gain of 02 million in fiscal 2014 and a loss of 12 million in fiscal 2013 the foreign currency loss for fiscal 2015 was driven by the changes in the local currency denominated balance sheet accounts the appreciation of the us dollar against the british pound and euro and the depreciation of the us dollar against the renminbi the foreign currency loss for fiscal 2013 was driven by the changes in the local currency denominated balance sheet accounts the appreciation of the us dollar against the british pound and euro and the depreciation of the us dollar against the renminbi additionally during fiscal 2014 we recognized a 21 million gain on an equity investment 

income taxes 

income tax benefit for fiscal 2015 was 751 million which is primarily comprised of tax expense related to domestic and international operations offset by a tax benefit of 1358 million related to a decrease in the valuation allowance against domestic deferred tax assets realization of substantially all of the domestic deferred tax assets is now more likely than not with the addition of the domestic deferred tax liabilities arising from amortizable intangible assets in connection with the business combination for fiscal 2015 this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 619 

in comparison income tax expense for fiscal 2014 was 112 million which was primarily comprised of tax expense related to international operations for fiscal 2014 this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 4705 

income tax expense for fiscal 2013 was 271 million which was primarily comprised of tax expense related to international operations a 13 million reduction in uk net deferred tax assets due to a decrease in the uk tax rate and a 120 million increase in the valuation allowance against uk net deferred tax assets in connection with the phase out of manufacturing operations at the newton aycliffe uk facility for fiscal 2013 this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 10464 

a valuation allowance has been established against deferred tax assets in the taxing jurisdictions where based upon the positive and negative evidence available it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized realization is dependent upon generating future income in the taxing jurisdictions in which the operating loss carryovers credit carryovers depreciable tax basis and other tax deferred assets exist the realizability of these deferred tax assets is reevaluated on a quarterly basis as of the end of fiscal years 2013 2014 and 2015 the valuation allowance against domestic and foreign deferred tax assets was 1642 million 1433 million and 138 million respectively 

the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets increased in fiscal 2013 by 515 million from the 1127 million balance as of the end of fiscal 2012 the increase was comprised of 120 million established during the fiscal year related to the uk net deferred tax assets 108 million related to the amalfi acquisition and a 287 million increase related to other changes in domestic net deferred tax assets during the fiscal year the uk valuation allowance was recorded as a result of the decision announced in march 2013 to phase out manufacturing at the uk facility consequently we determined that this represented significant negative evidence and that it was no longer “more likely than not” that any uk deferred tax assets remaining at the end of fiscal 2014 would ultimately be realized 

the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets decreased in fiscal 2014 by 209 million the decrease was comprised of the reversal of the 120 million uk valuation allowance established during fiscal 2013 and 151 million related to deferred tax assets used against deferred intercompany profits offset by increases related to a 34 million adjustment in the net operating losses acquired in the amalfi acquisition and 28 million for other changes in net deferred tax assets for domestic and other foreign subsidiaries during the fiscal year the uk valuation allowance was reversed in connection with the sale of the uk manufacturing facility in fiscal 2014 and the writeoff of the remaining uk deferred tax assets 

the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets decreased in fiscal 2015 by 1295 million the decrease was comprised of 1357 million for domestic deferred tax assets for which realization is now more likely than not with the increase in domestic deferred tax liabilities related to domestic amortizable intangible assets arising in connection with the business combination and other changes in the net deferred tax assets for foreign subsidiaries during the fiscal year offset by an increase of 62 million related to deferred tax assets acquired in the business combination which are not more likely than not of being realized at the end of fiscal 2015 a 02 million valuation allowance remained against foreign net deferred tax assets and a 136 million valuation allowance remained against domestic deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized effectively increasing the domestic net deferred tax liabilities 

  

as of march 28 2015 we had federal loss carryovers of approximately 2023 million that expire in fiscal years 2016 to 2035 if unused and state losses of approximately 1849 million that expire in fiscal years 2016 to 2035 if unused federal research credits of 799 million federal foreign tax credits of 17 million and state credits of 459 million may expire in fiscal years 2018 to 2035 2016 to 2035 and 2016 to 2030 respectively federal alternative minimum tax credits of 32 million carry forward indefinitely included in the amounts above are certain net operating losses and other tax attribute assets acquired in conjunction with acquisitions in prior years the utilization of these acquired domestic tax assets is subject to certain annual limitations as required under internal revenue code section 382 and similar state income tax provisions 

our gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled 379 million as of march 30 2013 394 million as of march 29 2014 and 594 million as of march 28 2015 of these amounts 297 million net of federal benefit of state taxes 309 million net of federal benefit of state taxes and 550 million net of federal benefit of state taxes as of march 30 2013 march 29 2014 and march 28 2015 respectively represent the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective tax rate in each of the fiscal years it is our policy to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense as of march 28 2015 accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits totaled 34 million of which 12 million was recognized in fiscal 2015 a minimal amount included in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits at march 28 2015 which is related to tax positions for 

which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts could significantly change in the next 12 months this amount represents a potential decrease in gross unrecognized tax benefits related to reductions for tax positions in prior years 

stockbased compensation 

under fasb asc 718 “compensation – stock compensation”  asc 718 stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award using an option pricing model for stock options blackscholes and market price for restricted stock units and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period 

as of march 28 2015  total remaining unearned compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock units and options was 1530 million  which will be amortized over the weightedaverage remaining service period of approximately 13 years  

liquidity and capital resources 

we have funded our operations to date through revenue from product sales sales of equity and debt securities bank borrowings and capital equipment leases as of march 28 2015  we had working capital of approximately 11748 million  including 2998 million  in cash and cash equivalents compared to working capital at march 29 2014  of 3174 million  including 1719 million  in cash and cash equivalents working capital increased primarily due to improved profitability and 2243 million in cash received from triquint in the business combination 

our total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 5446 million  as of march 28 2015  this balance includes approximately 1455 million  held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds held by our foreign subsidiaries are needed for our operations in the us we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds we currently expect to reinvest these funds outside of the us permanently and do not expect to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

stock repurchase   

on february 5 2015 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 200 million of our outstanding shares of common stock exclusive of related fees commissions or other expenses repurchases may be made at management’s discretion from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and the program may be discontinued at any time during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we repurchased approximately 08 million  shares of our common stock at an average price of 6587  on the open market for approximately 500 million including transaction costs as of march 28 2015 approximately 1500 million remains available for repurchase under this program 

in connection with the business combination each share of rfmd common stock was converted into the right to receive 025  of a share of qorvo common stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares and each share of triquint common stock was converted into the right to receive 04187  of a share of qorvo common stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares approximately 13160 fractional shares were repurchased for 09 million 

prior to the business combination rfmd had a share repurchase program under which rfmd was authorized to repurchase up to 200 million of rfmds outstanding shares of common stock under this program and denominated in shares of qorvo common stock during fiscal 2014  we repurchased approximately 06 million  shares of our common stock at an average price of 2012  on the open market for approximately 128 million  including transaction costs and during fiscal 2013  we repurchased approximately 05 million  shares of our common stock at an average price of 1500  on the open market for approximately 70 million  including transaction costs 

cash flows from operating activities   

operating activities in fiscal 2015  provided cash of 3056 million  compared to 1308 million  in fiscal 2014  this yearoveryear increase was primarily attributable to improved profitability resulting from manufacturing and sourcingrelated cost reductions as well as higher revenue 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2015  was 639 million  compared to 570 million  in fiscal 2014  the business combination accounted for an increase in cash provided by investing activities of approximately 2243 million this increase was offset by an increase in net purchases of availableforsale securities as well as increased purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily to fund additional manufacturing capacity 

  

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2015 was 1129 million  compared to 42 million  in fiscal 2014 net cash used in financing activities was higher during fiscal 2015 as we paid the 875 million  remaining principal balance of the 2014 notes in addition during fiscal 2015 we repurchased approximately 08 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 6587 on the open market for a total of 500 million plus we repurchased fractional shares in connection with the business combination for 09 million 

our future capital requirements may differ materially from those currently anticipated and will depend on many factors including but not limited to market acceptance of our products volume pricing concessions capital improvements demand for our products technological advances and our relationships with suppliers and customers based on current and projected levels of cash flow from operations coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents and our revolving credit facility we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet both our shortterm and longterm cash requirements however if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products or in the event that growth is faster than we had anticipated operating cash flows may be insufficient to meet our needs if existing resources and cash from operations are not sufficient to meet our future requirements or if we perceive conditions to be favorable we may seek additional debt or equity financing we cannot be sure that any additional equity or debt financing will not be dilutive to holders of our common stock further we cannot be sure that additional equity or debt financing if required will be available on favorable terms if at all 

impact of inflation 

we do not believe that the effects of inflation had a significant impact on our revenue or income from continuing operations during fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  our financial results in fiscal 2016 could be adversely affected by wage and commodity price inflation including precious metals

the crosslicensing liability represents payables under a crosslicensing agreement which are included in accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of march 28 2015 

deferred compensation   

commitments for deferred compensation represents the liability for our nonqualified deferred compensation plan the plan the plan provides eligible employees and members of the board of directors with the opportunity to defer a specified percentage of their cash compensation the deferred earnings are invested at the discretion of each participating employee or director and the deferred compensation we are obligated to deliver is adjusted for increases or decreases in the deferred amount due to such investment the current portion and noncurrent portion of the deferred compensation obligation is included in accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

other contractual obligations   

as of march 28 2015  in addition to the amounts shown in the contractual obligations table above we have 628 million of unrecognized income tax benefits and accrued interest of which 116 million has been recorded as a liability we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 

as discussed in note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report we have two pension plans in germany with a combined benefit obligation of approximately 122 million  as of march 28 2015  pension benefit payments are not included in the schedule above as they are not available for all periods presented pension benefit payments were less than 05 million in fiscal 2015 and are expected to be consistent in fiscal 2016 

credit agreement 

in march 2013 rfmd and certain material domestic subsidiaries of rfmd entered into a fouryear senior credit facility with bank of america na as administrative agent and a lender and a syndicate of other lenders the credit facility on march 26 2015 rfmd terminated its credit facility in anticipation of qorvo entering into a new larger revolving credit facility which qorvo entered into on april 7 2015 see note 18 no borrowings were ever made under the credit facility and no early termination penalty was incurred by rfmd in connection with such termination 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to use judgment and estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management our critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies however these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report 

inventory reserves the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons generally 12 to 24 months the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory reserves are the same as those used in our revenue forecasts and are also consistent with the estimates used in our manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base market conditions and customer acceptance of our products and technologies as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost 

historically inventory reserves have fluctuated as new technologies have been introduced and customers’ demand has shifted inventory reserves had a 1 or lower impact on margins in fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  

revenue recognition   net revenue is generated principally from sales of semiconductor products we recognize revenue from product sales when the fundamental criteria are met such as the time at which the title and risk and rewards of product ownership are transferred to the customer price and terms are fixed or determinable no significant vendor obligation exists and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

sales of products are generally made through either our sales force manufacturers representatives or through a distribution network revenue from the majority of our products is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer from a companyowned or thirdparty location some revenue is recognized upon receipt of the shipment by the customer we have limited rebate programs offering price protection to certain distributors these rebates represent less than 1  of net revenue and can be reasonably estimated based on specific criteria included in the rebate agreements and other known factors at the time we reduce revenue and record reserves for product returns and allowances for price protection and stock rotation based on historical experience or specific identification depending on the contractual terms of the arrangement 

we also recognize a portion of our net revenue through other agreements such as nonrecurring engineering fees contracts for research and development work royalty income intellectual property ip revenue and service revenue these agreements are collectively less than 1 of consolidated revenue on an annual basis revenue from these agreements is recognized when the service is completed or upon certain milestones as provided for in the agreements 

revenue from certain contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the costs incurred to date and the total contract amount plus the contractual fee if these contracts experience cost overruns the percentage of completion method is used to determine revenue recognition revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized when the required deliverable is satisfied 

royalty income is recognized based on a percentage of sales of the relevant product reported by licensees during the period 

in addition we license or sell our rights to use portions of our ip portfolio which includes certain patent rights useful in the manufacture and sales of certain products ip revenue recognition is dependent on the terms of each agreement we will recognize ip revenue i upon delivery of the ip and ii if we have no substantive future obligation to perform under the arrangement we will defer recognition of ip revenue where future performance 

obligations are required to earn the revenue or the revenue is not guaranteed revenue from services is recognized during the period that the service is performed 

accounts receivable are recorded for all revenue items listed above we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations subsequent to the original sale we will record an allowance against amounts due and thereby reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected for all other customers we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due industry and geographic concentrations the current business environment and the company’s historical experience 

our terms and conditions do not give our customers a right of return associated with the original sale of its products however we will authorize sales returns under certain circumstances which include perceived quality problems courtesy returns and likekind exchanges we evaluate our estimate of returns by analyzing all types of returns and the timing of such returns in relation to the original sale reserves are adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated returns versus the original sale of product 

goodwill and intangible assets   goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for a business exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired intangibles are recorded when such assets are acquired by purchase or license the value of our intangibles including goodwill could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results ii a decline in the value of technology company stocks including the value of our common stock iii a prolonged or more significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the semiconductor industry or iv failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results    

goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives   

we account for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in accordance with the fasbs guidance which requires that they be tested annually for impairment or earlier if facts and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired we perform our annual impairment test for our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on the first day of the fourth quarter in each fiscal year our i ndefinitelived intangible assets consist of iprd 

for fiscal 2015 we have determined that our reporting units are mp and idp for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill in evaluating our reporting units we first consider our operating segments and related components in accordance with fasb guidance goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the expected benefit from the synergies of the business combinations generating the underlying goodwill as of   march 28 2015  our goodwill balance of   21406 million   is allocated between our mp and idp reporting units 

we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment commonly referred to as step zero to determine whether further quantitative analysis for impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets is necessary in performing step zero for our impairment test we are required to make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to the following the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to our business industry and market trends and the overall future financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate we also consider recent fair value calculations of our indefinitelived intangible assets and reporting units as well as cost factors such as changes in raw materials labor or other costs if the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinitelived asset is less than its respective carrying value including goodwill then we would perform an additional quantitative analysis for goodwill this involves a twostep process the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit including its goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then the second step of the process is performed to determine the amount of impairment the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recognized for the amount the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value for indefinitelived intangible assets the quantitative analysis compares the carrying value of the asset to its fair value and an impairment charge is recognized for the amount its carrying value exceeds its fair value determining the fair value of reporting units indefinitelived intangible assets and implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill is reliant upon estimated future revenues profitability and cash flows and consideration of market factors assumptions judgments and estimates are complex subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts although we 

believe the assumptions judgments and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate different assumptions judgments and estimates could materially affect our results of operations 

we performed a step zero analysis for our goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  as a result of our analysis no further quantitative impairment test was deemed necessary for fiscal 2015  there was no impairment of goodwill as a result of our annual impairment tests completed during the fourth quarters of fiscal years 2015 2014  and 2013  

in fiscal 2015 as a result of the business combination we recorded iprd of 4700 million iprd was recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition as an indefinitelived intangible asset until t he completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts or impairment the fair value of the acquired iprd was determined based on an income approach using the excess earnings method which   estimated the value of the intangible assets by discounting the future projected earnings of the asset to present value as of the valuation date upon completion of development acquired iprd assets are transferred to finitelived intangible assets and amortized over their useful lives see note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding an impairment of assets recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 

intangible assets  with definite lives 

intangible assets are recorded when such assets are acquired by purchase or license    finitelived intangible assets consist primarily of technology licenses customer relationships developed technology a wafer supply agreement trade names and backlog resulting from business combinations and are subject to amortization 

technology licenses are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straightline basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the technology or the term of the license agreement ranging from approximately five  to eight  years 

the fair value of customer relationships acquired during fiscal years 2013 and 2015 was determined based on an income approach using the “with and without method in which the value of the asset is determined by the difference in discounted cash flows of the profitability of the company with the asset and the profitability of the company without the asset customer relationships are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life ranging from three  to ten  years 

the f air value of developed technology acquired during fiscal years 2013  and 2015 was det ermined based on an income approach using the excess earnings method which estimated the value of the intangible assets by discounting the future projected earnings of the asset to present value as of the valuation date developed technology is amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of four  to six  years 

the fair value of the wafer supply agreement was determined using the incremental income method which is a discounted cash flow method within the income approach under this method the fair value was estimated by discounting to present value the additional savings from expense reductions in operations at a discount rate to reflect the risk inherent in the wafer supply agreement as well as any tax benefits the wafer supply agreement is amortized on a units of use activity method and has a useful life of approximately four  years 

the fair value of trade names acquired in fiscal 2015 was determined based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method in which the value of the asset is determined by discounting the future projected cash flows generated from the trade names estimated royalties trade names are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of three  years 

the fair value of backlog acquired in fiscal 2015 was determined based on an income approach using the excess earnings method and is amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of one  year 

we regularly review identified intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we originally estimated or that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable if such facts and circumstances exist we assess the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts impairments if any are based on the excess of the carrying 

amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the impairment determination was made 

impairment of longlived assets   we review the carrying values of all longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of a business significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of assets 

in making impairment determinations for longlived assets we utilize certain assumptions including but not limited to i estimations and quoted market prices of the fair market value of the assets and ii estimations of future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization length of service that the asset will be used in our operations and estimated salvage values 

stockbased compensation    stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award using an option pricing model for stock options blackscholes and market price for restricted stock units and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period the blackscholes option pricing model requires a number of assumptions including the expected lives of stock options the volatility of the public market price for our common stock and interest rates 

income taxes    in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

as part of our financial process we assess on a tax jurisdictional basis the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not likely a likelihood of less than 50 percent the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to ultimately be recoverable in this process certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the amount of income or loss in prior years the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies changes in taxable income market conditions us or international tax laws and other factors may change our judgment regarding whether we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets these changes if any may require material adjustments to the net deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding changes in the valuation allowance and net deferred tax assets 

as part of our financial process we also assess the likelihood that our tax reporting positions will ultimately be sustained to the extent it is determined it is more likely than not that a tax reporting position will ultimately not be recognized and sustained a provision for unrecognized tax benefit is provided by either reducing the applicable deferred tax asset or accruing an income tax liability our judgment regarding the sustainability of our tax reporting positions may change in the future due to changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to the related deferred tax assets or accrued income tax liabilities and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions and the amount of unrecognized tax benefits 

recent accounting pronouncements 

accounting pronouncements not yet effective 

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers that amends existing guidance on revenue recognition the new guidance is based on principles that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods and services to customers at an amount the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services the guidance requires additional disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows and both qualitative and quantitative information about contracts with customers and applied significant judgments the new authoritative guidance will become effective in the first quarter of 

fiscal 2018 using one of two retrospective methods of adoption the company has not determined which method it will adopt and is currently evaluating the effects the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements 

accounting pronouncements recently adopted 

in july 2013 the fasb issued asu 201311 “income taxes topic 740 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists”  asu 201311 requires an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented in the financial statements as a reduction of a deferred tax asset or a tax credit carryforward excluding certain exceptions this asu was effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to seek a reduction in the potential negative earnings effects from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity prices arising from our business activities we manage these financial exposures through operational means and by using various financial instruments these practices may change as economic conditions change 

interest rates   

availableforsale securities 

we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from our investments in availableforsale securities in accordance with an investment policy approved by the audit committee of our board of directors our availableforsale securities are predominantly comprised of us governmentagency securities money market funds and corporate debt we continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of issuers with respect to our availableforsale securities as a result of this monitoring and volatility of the financial markets we adopted a more conservative investment strategy and we are currently investing in lower risk and consequently lower interestbearing investments accordingly we believe that the effects of changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of these issuers are limited and would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations however it is possible that we would be at risk if interest rates or the credit ratings of these issuers were to change unfavorably 

at march 28 2015  we held availableforsale investments with an estimated fair value of 2995 million  we do not purchase financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes our investments are classified as availableforsale securities and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income our cash and cash equivalents and investments earned an average annual interest rate of approximately 01 in fiscal 2015 or less than 05 million in interest income in fiscal 2014 our investments earned an average annual interest rate of approximately 01 or approximately 01 million in interest income we do not have any investments denominated in foreign currencies and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments 

currency exchange rates 

as a global company our results are affected by movements in currency exchange rates our exposure may increase or decrease over time as our foreign business levels fluctuate in the countries where we have operations and these changes could have a material impact on our financial results the functional currency for most of our international operations is the us dollar we have foreign operations in costa rica europe and asia and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the us our international revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars operating expenses and certain working capital items related to our foreignbased operations are in some instances denominated in the local foreign currencies and therefore are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies such as the renminbi euro pound sterling and costa rican colon if the us dollar weakens compared to the renminbi euro pound sterling costa rican colon and other currencies our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when remeasured back into us dollars we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means 

for fiscal 2015 we incurred a foreign currency loss of 02 million as compared to a gain of 02 million in fiscal 2014 which is recorded in “other income expense” the foreign currency loss for fiscal 2015 was driven by the changes in the local currency denominated balance sheet accounts the appreciation of the us dollar against the british pound and euro and the depreciation of the us dollar against the renminbi 

  

our financial instrument holdings including foreign receivables cash and payables at march 28 2015  were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes in this sensitivity analysis we assumed that the change in one currencys rate relative to the us dollar would not have an effect on other currencies rates relative to the us dollar all other factors were held constant if the us dollar declined in value 10 in relation to the remeasured foreign currency instruments our net income would have increased by approximately 17 million if the us dollar increased in value 10 in relation to the remeasured foreign currency instruments our net income would have decreased by approximately 14 million 

commodity prices   

we routinely use precious metals in the manufacture of our products supplies for such commodities may from time to time become restricted or general market factors and conditions may affect the pricing of such commodities in fiscal 2015 we were able to complete process technology improvements that are replacing gold with lowercost materials to reduce this exposure we also have an active reclamation process to capture any unused gold while we continue to attempt to mitigate the risk of similar increases in commoditiesrelated costs there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully safeguard against potential shortterm and longterm commodity price fluctuations
