ingredients and packaging 

the ingredients and packaging materials required for the manufacture of our food and beverage products are purchased from various suppliers substantially all of which are located in north america during 2022 we experienced significantly elevated commodity and supply chain costs including the costs of labor raw materials energy fuel packaging materials and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products in addition many of these items are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including but not limited to climate change changes in crop size cattle cycles herd and flock disease crop disease crop pests product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations supplier capacities governmentsponsored agricultural programs and other government policy import and export requirements including tariffs drought and excessive rain temperature extremes and other adverse weather events water scarcity scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients pandemic illness such as the covid19 pandemic armed hostilities including the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine and other factors that may be beyond our control to help reduce some of this price volatility we use a combination of purchase orders short and longterm contracts inventory management practices and various commodity risk management tools for most of our ingredients and packaging ingredient inventories are generally at a peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only during certain seasons we make commitments for the purchase of such ingredients in their respective seasons although we are unable to predict the impact of our ability to source these ingredients and packaging materials in the future we expect these supply pressures to continue throughout 2023 we also expect the pressures of input cost inflation to continue into 2023 

customers 

in most of our markets sales and merchandising activities are conducted through our own sales force andor thirdparty brokers and distribution partners our products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains mass discounters mass merchandisers club stores convenience stores drug stores dollar stores ecommerce and other retail commercial and noncommercial establishments our snacks segment has a directstoredelivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 47  of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2022 46 in 2021 and 44 in 2020 our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 22  of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2022 and 21  in 2021 and 2020 both of our reportable segments sold products to walmart stores inc or its affiliates no other customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

trademarks and technology 

as of september 14 2022 we owned over 2800 trademark registrations and applications in over 150 countries we believe our trademarks are of material importance to our business although the laws vary by jurisdiction trademarks generally are valid as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to have become generic trademark registrations generally can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use we believe that our principal brands including campbells  cape cod  chunky  emerald  goldfish  kettle brand  lance  late july  milano  pace  pacific foods  pepperidge farm  pop secret  prego  snack factory  snyders of hanover  spaghettios  swanson  and v8  are protected by trademark law in the major markets where they are used 

although we own a number of valuable patents we do not regard any segment of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents in addition we own copyrights both registered and unregistered proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories this competition arises from numerous competitors of varying sizes across multiple food and beverage categories and includes producers of private label products as well as other branded food and beverage manufacturers private label products are generally sold at lower prices than branded products competitors market and sell their products through traditional retailers and ecommerce all of these competitors vie for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars the number of competitors cannot be reliably estimated our principal areas of competition are brand recognition taste nutritional value price promotion innovation shelf space and customer service 

capital expenditures 

during 2022 our aggregate capital expenditures were 242 million we expect to spend approximately 325 million for capital projects in 2023 major capital projects based on planned spend in 2023 include a cracker capacity expansion for our snacks business and a new manufacturing line for our meals  beverages business 

government regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated in the us our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies including the food and drug administration the department of agriculture the federal trade commission the department of labor the department of commerce the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the us additionally we are subject to data privacy and security regulations tax and securities regulations accounting and reporting standards and other financial laws and regulations we believe that we are in compliance with current laws and regulations in all material respects and do not expect that continued compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

environmental matters 

we have requirements for the operation and design of our facilities that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations of our 242 million in capital expenditures made during 2022 approximately 9 million were for compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the us we further estimate that approximately 13 million of the capital expenditures anticipated during 2023 will be for compliance with us environmental laws and regulations we believe that the continued compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations both within the us and elsewhere will not have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position in addition we continue to monitor existing and pending environmental laws and regulations within the us and elsewhere relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions while the impact of these laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations although the risks are organized and described separately many of the risks are interrelated additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

business and operational risks 

we may not be able to increase prices to fully offset inflationary pressures on costs such as raw and packaging materials labor and distribution costs 

as a manufacturer of food and beverage products we rely on plant labor distribution resources and raw and packaging materials including tomato paste grains beef poultry dairy vegetable oil wheat potatoes and other vegetables steel aluminum glass paper and resin during 2022 we experienced significantly elevated commodity and supply chain costs including the costs of labor raw materials energy fuel packaging materials and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products and we expect elevated levels of inflation to continue in 2023 in addition many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including but not limited to changes in crop size cattle cycles herd and flock disease crop disease crop pests product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations supplier capacities governmentsponsored agricultural programs and other government policy import and export requirements including tariffs drought and excessive rain temperature extremes and other adverse weather events water scarcity scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients pandemic illness such as the 

covid19 pandemic armed hostilities including the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine and other factors that may be beyond our control 

we try to mitigate some or all cost increases through increases in the selling prices of or decreases in the packaging sizes of some of our products higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lowerpriced offerings or may forego some purchases altogether during an economic downturn or times of increased inflationary pressure to the extent that price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs adequately or in a timely manner andor if they result in significant decreases in sales volume our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected furthermore we may not be able to fully offset any cost increases through productivity initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity 

disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to manufacture andor sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing warehousing or distribution capabilities or to the capabilities of our suppliers contract manufacturers logistics service providers or independent distributors this damage or disruption could result from execution issues as well as factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as increased temperatures due to climate change water stress extreme weather events natural disasters product or raw material scarcity fire terrorism pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic armed hostilities including the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine strikes labor shortages cybersecurity breaches government shutdowns disruptions in logistics supplier capacity constraints or other events commodity prices continue to be volatile and generally increased due to the covid19 pandemic supply chain disruptions and labor and transportation shortages production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought and excessive rain temperature extremes and other adverse weather events water scarcity scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients crop size cattle cycles herd and flock disease crop disease and crop pests failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur may adversely affect our business or financial results particularly in circumstances when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location disputes with significant suppliers contract manufacturers logistics service providers or independent distributors including disputes regarding pricing or performance may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture andor sell our products as well as our business or financial results 

we have experienced temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have implemented employee safety measures which exceed guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention and world health organization across all our supply chain facilities even with these measures and the availability of vaccines given the emergence and spread of covid19 variants there is continued risk that covid19 may spread through our workforce illness labor shortages absenteeism or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain manufacturing distribution or other business processes we may face additional production disruptions in the future which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs 

shortterm or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic and related ongoing implications could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has had and could continue to have a negative impact on financial markets economic conditions and portions of our industry as a result of changes in consumer behavior retailer inventory levels cost inflation manufacturing and supply chain disruption vaccination rates and effectiveness and overall macroeconomic conditions although our business has benefited from increased athome consumption due to covid19 our ability to sustain heightened sales is dependent on consumer purchasing behavior the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines may partially mitigate the risks around the continued spread of covid19 however with the spread of the covid19 variants the ongoing implications of the covid19 pandemic could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways including but not limited to 

• a shutdown of one or more of our manufacturing warehousing or distribution facilities or disruption in our supply chain including but not limited to as a result of illness labor shortages government restrictions or other workforce disruptions 

• the failure of third parties on which we rely including but not limited to those that supply our packaging ingredients equipment and other necessary operating materials comanufacturers and independent contractors to meet their obligations to us or significant disruptions in their ability to do so 

• a strain on our supply chain which could result from shortterm or sustained changes and volatility in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns that increase demand at our retail customers and exceed our production capacity for our products 

• continued volatility in commodity and other input costs which may not be sufficiently offset by our commodity hedging activities 

• a disruption to our distribution capabilities or to our distribution channels including those of our suppliers contract manufacturers logistics service providers or independent distributors 

• new or escalated government or regulatory responses in markets where we manufacture sell or distribute our products or in the markets of third parties on which we rely could prevent or disrupt our business operations 

• a significant portion of our workforce including our management team could become unable to work as a result of illness or the attention of our management team could be diverted if key employees become ill and become unable to work 

• a change in demand for or availability of our products as a result of retailers distributors or carriers modifying their inventory fulfillment or shipping practices 

• an inability to effectively modify our trade promotion and advertising activities to reflect changing consumer shopping habits due to among other things reduced instore visits and travel restrictions 

• a shift in consumer spending during periods of economic uncertainty or inflation could result in consumers moving to private label or lower price products and 

• additional business disruptions and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives 

these and other impacts of the covid19 pandemic could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors included in this item 1a the ultimate impact depends on the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic including the emergence and spread of covid19 variants the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic each of which is uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict any of these disruptions could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

our results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages turnover and labor cost increases 

labor is a primary component of operating our business a number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs including high employment levels federal unemployment subsidies and other government regulations during 2022 we observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base caused by the continued spread of covid19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors could lead to increased costs such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business if we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a highlevel or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability such as overtime and thirdparty outsourcing have unintended negative effects our business could be adversely affected in addition we distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by truck reduced availability of trucking capacity due to shortages of drivers has caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and our suppliers an overall labor shortage lack of skilled labor increased turnover or labor inflation caused by covid19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations results of operations liquidity or cash flows 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly our trademarks to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark patent copyright and trade secret protection contractual agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results 

competing intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and timeconsuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development launch and sale of certain products any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results 

our results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is primarily based on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products packaging or ingredients whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our results could be adversely impacted 

we may be adversely impacted by a disruption failure or security breach of our information technology systems 

our information technology systems are critically important to our operations we rely on our information technology systems some of which are outsourced to third parties to manage our data communications and business processes including our marketing sales manufacturing procurement logistics customer service accounting and administrative functions and the importance of such networks and systems has increased due to an increase in our employees working remotely if we do not obtain and effectively manage the resources and materials necessary to build sustain and protect appropriate information technology systems our business or financial results could be adversely impacted furthermore our information technology systems are subject to attack or other security breaches including the access to or acquisition of customer consumer employee or other confidential information service disruptions or other system failures if we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve these breaches disruptions or failures our operations may be impacted and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as reputational damage litigation remediation costs ransomware payments andor penalties under various data protection laws and regulations 

to address the risks to our information technology systems and the associated costs we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology and security policies cyber insurance employee awareness training and monitoring and routine testing of our information technology systems we believe that these preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks however cyber threats are constantly evolving are becoming more frequent and more sophisticated and are being made by groups of individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them additionally continued geopolitical turmoil including the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine has heightened the risk of cyberattacks we have experienced threats to our data and systems and although we have not experienced a material inc ident to date there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber incidents 

in addition in the event our suppliers or customers experience a breach or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in our supply chain or reduced customer orders which would adversely affect our business and financial results we have also outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies our information security program includes capabilities designed to evaluate and mitigate cyber risks arising from thirdparty service providers we believe that these capabilities provide insights and visibility to the security posture of our thirdparty service providers however cyber threats to those organizations are beyond our control if these service providers do not perform effectively due to breach or system failure we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and our business may be disrupted 

we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business 

we depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we also compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results in addition activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

if we do not fully realize the expected cost savings andor operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives our profitability could suffer 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry particularly in an environment of volatile cost inputs we continuously 

pursue initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives for additional information on these initiatives we also regularly pursue cost productivity initiatives in procurement manufacturing and logistics any failure or delay in implementing our initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our ability to meet our longterm growth and profitability expectations and could adversely affect our business if we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease 

our results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of acquisitions divestitures and other strategic transactions 

we have historically made strategic acquisitions of brands and businesses and we may undertake additional acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future our ability to meet our objectives with respect to acquisitions and other strategic transactions may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable counterparties negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected and complete those transactions potential risks also include 

• the inability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in a timely and costefficient manner including implementation of enterpriseresource planning systems 

• diversion of managements attention from other business concerns 

• potential loss of key employees suppliers andor customers of acquired businesses 

• assumption of unknown risks and liabilities 

• the inability to achieve anticipated benefits including revenues or other operating results 

• operating costs of acquired businesses may be greater than expected 

• the inability to promptly implement an effective control environment and 

• the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience 

in addition we have previously made strategic divestitures and may do so in the future any businesses we decide to divest in the future may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected potential risks of divestitures may also include 

• diversion of managements attention from other business concerns 

• loss of key suppliers andor customers of divested businesses 

• the inability to separate divested businesses or business units effectively and efficiently from our existing business operations and 

• the inability to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs 

if we are unable to complete or realize the projected benefits of future acquisitions divestitures or other strategic transactions our business or financial results may be adversely impacted 

competitive and industry risks 

we face significant competition in all our product categories which may result in lower sales and margins 

we operate in the highly competitive food and beverage industry mainly in the north american market and experience competition in all of our categories the principal areas of competition are brand recognition taste nutritional value price promotion innovation shelf space and customer service a number of our primary competitors are larger than us and have substantial financial marketing and other resources and some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do in addition reduced barriers to entry and easier access to funding are creating new competition a strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts or a continued shift towards private label offerings particularly during periods of economic uncertainty or significant inflation could result in us reducing prices increasing marketing or other expenditures andor losing market share each of which may result in lower sales and margins 

our ability to compete also depends upon our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences there are inherent marketplace risks associated with new product or packaging introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance if we do not succeed in offering products that consumers want to buy our sales and market share will decrease resulting in reduced profitability if we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longlasting or are unable to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales will decline weak economic conditions recessions significant inflation and other factors such as pandemics could effect consumer preferences and demand in addition given the variety of backgrounds and identities of consumers in our consumer base we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences as such we must be successful in developing innovative products across a multitude of product categories in addition the covid19 pandemic has altered and in some cases delayed product innovation efforts finally if we fail to rapidly develop products in fastergrowing and more profitable categories we could experience reduced demand for our products or fail to expand margins 

we may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customers 

our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade which has experienced slower growth than other retail channels such as dollar stores drug stores club stores and ecommerce retailers we expect this trend away from traditional retail grocery to alternate channels to continue in the future these alternative retail channels may also create consumer price deflation affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases in addition retailers with increased buying power and negotiating strength are seeking more favorable terms including increased promotional programs and customized products funded by their suppliers these customers may also use more of their shelf space for their private label products which are generally sold at lower prices than branded products if we are unable to use our scale marketing product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics our business or financial results could be adversely impacted 

in 2022 our five largest customers accounted for approximately 47  of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations with the largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounting for approximately 22  of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations there can be no assurance that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past disruption of sales to any of these customers or to any of our other large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results 

financial and economic risks 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could adversely affect our financial results and net worth 

as of july 31 2022 we had goodwill of 3979 billion and other indefinitelived intangible assets of 2549 billion goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators arise we test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including goodwill to the units fair value similarly we test indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values fair value for both goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis if the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets exceed their fair value the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are considered impaired factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates if current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions that could be affected by the covid19 pandemic or otherwise were to change we may be required in the future to record impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets which could adversely affect our financial results and net worth 

we may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to our defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in the us and certain nonus locations the major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets investment returns interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet a significant increase in our obligations future funding requirements or net periodic benefit costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we face risks related to heightened inflation recession financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions recession equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the us or other nations for instance in 2022 the us experienced significantly heightened inflationary pressures which we expect to continue into 2023 we may not be able to fully mitigate the impact of inflation through price increases productivity initiatives and cost savings which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition if the us economy enters a recession in 2023 we may experience sales declines and may have to decrease prices all of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

similarly disruptions in financial andor credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors and might cause us to not be able to continue to have access to preferred sources of liquidity when needed or on terms we find acceptable and our borrowing costs could increase an economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed a disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties to our derivative contracts in addition changes in tax or interest rates in the us or other nations whether due to recession economic disruptions or other reasons may adversely impact us 

legal and regulatory risks 

we may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings or claims 

we are a party to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding reportable legal proceedings since these actions are inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such proceedings or claims or that our assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection with such matters will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims in particular the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal state and foreign laws or regulations including claims relating to the presence of heavy metals in food products additionally the independent contractor distribution model which is used in our snacks segment has also come under increased regulatory scrutiny our independent contractor distribution model has also been the subject of various class and individual lawsuits in recent years in the event we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against these proceedings or claims or if our assessment of the materiality of these proceedings or claims proves inaccurate our business or financial results may be adversely affected in addition our reputation could be damaged by allegations made in proceedings or claims even if untrue 

increased regulation or changes in law could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated various laws and regulations govern the processing packaging storage distribution marketing advertising labeling quality and safety of our food products as well as the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment in the us we are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies including but not limited to the food and drug administration the department of agriculture the federal trade commission the department of labor the department of commerce the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies we are also regulated by similar agencies outside the us 

governmental and administrative bodies within the us are considering a variety of tax trade and other regulatory reforms trade reforms include tariffs on certain materials used in the manufacture of our products and tariffs on certain finished products we regularly move data across national and state borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and state to state and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements 

changes in legal or regulatory requirements such as new food safety requirements and revised regulatory requirements for the labeling of nutrition facts serving sizes and genetically modified ingredients or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance cost capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial results 

if our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled we might need to recall those items and we may experience product liability claims and damage to our reputation 

we have in the past and we may in the future need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes sickness or injury to consumers a 

widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment a significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety andor quality of our products ingredients or packaging in addition if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in that category 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as wheat tomatoes potatoes cashews and almonds adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials lower recoveries of usable raw materials increase the prices of our raw materials increase our cost of storing and transporting our raw materials or disrupt production schedules we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain 

there is an increased focus by foreign federal state and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change regulating greenhouse gas emissions energy policies and sustainability increased compliance costs and expenses due to the impacts of climate change and additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change or designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment may cause disruptions in or an increase in the costs associated with the running of our manufacturing facilities and our business as well as increase distribution and supply chain costs moreover compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements may require us to make significant changes in our business operations and strategy which will likely require us to devote substantial time and attention to these matters and cause us to incur additional costs even if we make changes to align ourselves with such legal or regulatory requirements we may still be subject to significant penalties or potential litigation if such laws and regulations are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices the effects of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a longterm adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

additionally we might fail to effectively address increased attention from the media stockholders activists and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability matters such failure or the perception that we have failed to act responsibly regarding climate change whether or not valid could result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business and reputation moreover from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments including to reduce our impact on the environment for example in 2022 we established sciencebased targets for scope 1 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions our ability to achieve any stated goal target or objective is subject to numerous factors and conditions many of which are outside of our control examples of such factors include evolving regulatory requirements affecting sustainability standards or disclosures or imposing different requirements the pace of changes in technology the availability of requisite financing and the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards if we fail to achieve or are perceived to have failed or been delayed in achieving or improperly report our progress toward achieving these goals and commitments it could negatively affect consumer preference for our products or investor confidence in our stock as well as expose us to enforcement actions and litigation 

actions of activist shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs divert managements attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our business 

we were the target of activist shareholder activities in 2019 if a new activist investor purchased our stock our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time consuming disruptive to our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees in addition perceived uncertainties as to our future direction strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist shareholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities harm our ability to attract new investors customers employees suppliers and strategic partners and cause our share price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation 

our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine 

the global economy has been negatively impacted by the military conflict between russia and ukraine furthermore governments in the us united kingdom and european union have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in russia although we have no operations in russia or 

ukraine we have experienced shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation energy and raw material due in part to the negative impact of the russiaukraine military conflict on the global economy the scope and duration of the military conflict in ukraine is uncertain rapidly changing and hard to predict further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to the military conflict including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade could result in among other things cyberattacks supply disruptions lower consumer demand and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets any of which may adversely affect our business and supply chain

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in financial statements and supplementary data as well as the information contained in risk factors 

unless otherwise stated the terms we us our and the company refer to campbell soup company and its consolidated subsidiaries 

executive summary 

we are a manufacturer and marketer of highquality branded food and beverage products we operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories 

in 2022 we delivered solid fullyear results while advancing our strategic plan in a volatile macroeconomic environment during 2022 we navigated through a challenging environment marked by supply chain pressures particularly around labor and high inflation we enhanced and accelerated our recruiting efforts and hiring and onboarding processes which improved our ability to meet sustained consumer demand our improved supply chain execution combined with inflationdriven pricing continued supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives partially mitigated ongoing inflationary pressures experienced in 2022 we expect that inflation will continue to be a headwind in 2023 in addition we expect a pretax headwind of approximately 35 million in 2023 related to lower net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income 

strategy 

our strategy is to unlock our full growth potential by focusing on our core brands in two divisions within north america while delivering on the promise of our purpose  c onnecting people through food they love  our strategic plan is based on four pillars build a winning team and culture accelerate profitable growth fuel investments and margins with targeted cost savings and deliver on the promise of our purpose all as further discussed below 

we plan to continue our focus on building a winning team and culture by investing in our employee experience and improving employee engagement prioritizing our inclusion and diversity strategy and investing in strategic capabilities and digitization that support our core brands in north america in addition we plan to continue to deliver on the promise of our purpose with consumer transparency initiatives progress on our sustainability goals and strengthening our connection to the communities in which we operate 

we believe that we can accelerate our profitable growth model by growing market share and driving integrated business planning programming throughout the company we expect to grow market share through the development of more consumer 

oriented product quality marketing and innovation plans and prioritizing growth channels and retailers within our defined portfolio roles in addition we expect to continue to focus on accelerating the growth of our snacks brands while also sustaining the growth in us soup and our other core brands we expect that changes in consumer behavior driven by the covid19 pandemic will continue to support ongoing elevated consumer demand for food at home relative to prepandemic levels we plan to capitalize on this opportunity by addressing evolving consumer needs through our unique and differentiated portfolio 

we also expect to fuel investments and margins by continuing to focus on mitigating the effects of inflation we implemented price increases beginning in 2022 and continue to pursue our multiyear cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of 1 billion for continuing operations by the end of 2025 with 850 million in synergies and runrate cost savings achieved through 2022 see restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives for additional information on these initiatives 

business trends 

our businesses are being influenced by a variety of trends that we anticipate will continue in the future including cost inflation changing consumer preferences and a competitive and dynamic retail environment 

our strategy is designed in part to capture growing consumer preferences for snacking and convenience for example we believe that consumers are changing their eating habits by increasing the type and frequency of snacks they consume and are continuing inhome eating behaviors that were driven by the covid19 pandemic 

retailers continue to use their buying power and negotiating strength to seek increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms including customized products funded by their suppliers any consolidations among retailers would continue to create large and sophisticated customers that may further this trend retailers also continue to grow and promote store brands that compete with branded products especially on price 

throughout 2022 we experienced elevated demand for our retail products versus prepandemic levels but volumes were lower than fiscal 2021 in the first half of the year we experienced lower net sales due primarily to supply constraints based on materials availability and in the second half of the year although supply significantly improved volumes declined due to inflationdriven pricing actions we anticipate that demand related to athome food consumption will remain elevated through 2023 

we also anticipate that 2023 will continue to be a dynamic macroeconomic environment and expect input cost inflation to continue we will continue to take actions to mitigate a portion of this inflationary pressure but we do not expect such benefits will fully offset the incremental costs in 2023 based on benefit obligations and plan assets as of july 31 2022 net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income excluding any actuarial losses or gains is estimated to be approximately 35 million lower in 2023 subject to the impact of interim remeasurements the decrease in 2023 is due to increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations and a decline in the market value of plan assets 

business divestitures 

we completed the sale of our kelsen business on september 23 2019 on december 23 2019 we completed the sale of our arnott’s business and certain other international operations including the simple meals and shelfstable beverages businesses in australia and asia pacific the arnotts and other international operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019 we have reflected the results of operations of the kelsen business and the arnott’s and other international operations collectively referred to as campbell international as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented these businesses were historically included in the snacks reportable segment in addition on october 11 2019 we completed the sale of our european chips business the results of the european chips business through the date of sale were reflected in continuing operations within the snacks reportable segment

the effective tax rate was 224 in 2022 246 in 2021 and 227 in 2020 

the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2022 from 2021 was primarily due to a 19 million deferred tax charge recognized in the second quarter of 2021 in connection with a legal entity reorganization as part of the continued integration of snyderslance and state income tax law changes 

the increase in the effective rate in 2021 from 2020 was primarily due to the 19 million deferred tax charge recognized in the second quarter of 2021 and a 27 million tax benefit on the 64 million loss on the sale of the european chips business in 2020 

restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives 

multiyear cost savings initiatives and snyderslance cost transformation program and integration 

beginning in fiscal 2015 we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure 

over the years we expanded these initiatives by continuing to optimize our supply chain and manufacturing networks including closing our manufacturing facility in toronto ontario as well as our information technology infrastructure 

on march 26 2018 we completed the acquisition of snyderslance prior to the acquisition snyderslance launched a cost transformation program following a comprehensive review of its operations with the goal of significantly improving its financial performance we continued to implement this program and identified opportunities for additional cost synergies as we integrated snyderslance 

in 2022 we expanded these initiatives as we continue to pursue cost savings by further optimizing our supply chain and manufacturing network and through effective cost management cost estimates for these expanded initiatives as well as timing for certain activities are continuing to be developed 

a summary of charges recorded in earnings from continuing operations related to these initiatives is as follows 



a summary of the pretax costs in earnings from continuing operations associated with the initiatives is as follows 



the total estimated pretax costs for actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified to date are approximately 735 million to 740 million and we expect to incur the costs through 2023 these estimates will be updated as the expanded initiatives are developed 

we expect the costs for actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified to date to consist of the following approximately 230 million in severance pay and benefits approximately 85 million in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation and approximately 420 million to 425 million in implementation costs and other related costs we expect these pretax costs to be associated with our segments as follows meals  beverages  approximately 31 snacks  approximately 44 and corporate  approximately 25 

of the aggregate 735 million to 740 million of pretax costs associated with continuing operations identified to date we expect approximately 635 million to 640 million will be cash expenditures in addition we expect to invest approximately 445 million in capital expenditures through 2023 of which we invested 440 million as of july 31 2022 the capital expenditures primarily relate to a us warehouse optimization project improvement of quality safety and cost structure across the snyder’slance manufacturing network implementation of our existing sap enterpriseresource planning system for snyderslance transition of production of the toronto manufacturing facility to our us thermal plants optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications and optimization of the snyder’slance warehouse and distribution network 

we expect to fund the costs through cash flows from operations and shortterm borrowings 

we expect the initiatives for actions associated with continuing operations once all phases are implemented to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately 1 billion by the end of 2025 as of july 31 2022 we have generated total programtodate pretax savings of 850 million 

segment operating results do not include restructuring charges implementation costs and other related costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges a summary of the pretax costs in earnings from continuing operations associated with segments is as follows

discontinued operations 

we completed the sale of our kelsen business on september 23 2019 for 322 million we also completed the sale of the arnott’s and other international operations on december 23 2019 for 2286 billion the purchase price was subject to certain postclosing adjustments which resulted in 4 million of additional proceeds in the third quarter of 2020 b eginning in the fourth quarter of 2019 we have reflected the results of operations of the kelsen business and the arnott’s and other international operations or campbell international as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented these businesses were historically included in the snacks reportable segment 

results of discontinued operations were as follows 



in addition in the third quarter of 2021 we recognized a 6 million loss due to tax expense from returntoprovision adjustments related to the sale of campbell international 

the sale of the arnotts and other international operations resulted in a substantial capital gain for tax purposes we were able to utilize capital losses in 2020 which were offset with valuation allowances as of july 28 2019 to offset the capital gain 

liquidity and capital resources 

we expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations longterm borrowings shortterm borrowings which may include commercial paper credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents we believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements 

we generated cash flows from operations of 1181 billion in 2022 compared to 1035 billion in 2021 the increase in 2022 was primarily due to changes in working capital partially offset by lower cash earnings 

we generated cash flows from operations of 1035 billion in 2021 compared to 1396 billion in 2020 the decline in 2021 was primarily due changes in working capital mostly from a significant increase in accounts payable in the prior year and lower accrued liabilities in the current year 

current assets are less than current liabilities as a result of our level of current maturities of longterm debt and shortterm borrowings and our focus to lower core working capital requirements we had negative working capital of 923 million as of july 31 2022 and 119 million as of august 1 2021 total debt maturing within one year was 814 million as of july 31 2022 and 48 million as of august 1 2021 

capital expenditures were 242 million in 2022 275 million in 2021 and 299 million in 2020 capital expenditures are expected to total approximately 325 million in 2023 capital expenditures in 2022 included improvement of the quality and cost structure of the snyderslance manufacturing network the continued implementation of our existing sap enterpriseresource planning system for snyderslance and cookie and cracker capacity expansion for our snacks business capital expenditures in 2021 included the continued implementation of our existing sap enterpriseresource planning system for snyderslance chip capacity expansion projects a milano cookie capacity expansion project and a goldfish cracker capacity expansion project capital expenditures in 2020 included implementation of our existing sap enterpriseresource planning system for snyderslance a milano cookie capacity expansion project chip capacity expansion projects and a goldfish cracker capacity expansion project

we completed the sale of the arnott’s and other international operations on december 23 2019 for 2286 billion the purchase price was subject to certain postclosing adjustments which resulted in 4 million of additional proceeds in the third quarter of 2020 we used the net proceeds from the sale to reduce our debt through a series of actions on december 31 2019 we repaid the 100 million outstanding balance on our senior unsecured term loan facility on january 22 2020 we completed the redemption of all 500 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 425 senior notes due 2021 on january 24 2020 we settled tender offers to purchase 12 billion in aggregate principal amount of certain unsecured debt comprising 329 million of 330 senior notes due 2021 634 million of 365 senior notes due 2023 and 237 million of 380 senior notes due 2043 except for the 237 million of 380 senior notes due 2043 the senior notes settled under the tender offer were issued in connection with our acquisition of snyder’slance the consideration for the redemption and the tender offers was 1765 billion including 65 million of premium we recognized a loss of 75 million including 65 million 

of premium fees and other costs paid with the tender offers and unamortized debt issuance costs which was recorded in interest expense in the consolidated statement of earnings in addition we paid accrued and unpaid interest on the purchased notes through the dates of settlement the net divestiture proceeds remaining after these debt reduction activities were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings

we are in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit facilities and debt securities 

in september 2020 we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities under the registration statement we may issue debt securities from time to time depending on market conditions 

contractual obligations and other commitments 

contractual obligations 

we have short and longterm material cash requirements related to our contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business in addition to principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations our contractual obligations primarily consist of purchase commitments lease payments and pension and postretirement benefits 

see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our principal payments for shortterm borrowings and longterm debt obligations as of july 31 2022 interest payments for shortterm borrowings and longterm debt as of july 31 2022 are approximately as follows 165 million in 2023 290 million in 2024 through 2025 220 million in 2026 through 2027 and 12 billion from 2028 through maturity 

purchase commitments represent purchase orders and longterm purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients supplies machinery equipment and services as of july 31 2022 purchase commitments totaled approximately 1535 billion approximately 127 billion of these purchase commitments will be settled in the ordinary course of business in the next 12 months and the balance of 265 million from 2024 through 2027 

see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our lease obligations as of july 31 2022 

as of july 31 2022 we recognized a pension liability of 120 million and a postretirement benefit obligation of 172 million as of july 31 2022 we also recognized a pension asset of  146 million based on the funded status of certain plans see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements and significant accounting estimates for further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements and other commitments 

we guarantee approximately 4800 bank loans made to independent contractor distributors by thirdparty financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes the maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees we could be required to make is  500 million as of july 31 2022 our guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes we do not expect that we will be required to make material guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed 

these obligations and commitments impact our liquidity and capital resource needs we expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations longterm borrowings shortterm borrowings which may include commercial paper credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents we believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements 

market risk sensitivity 

the principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices in addition we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations we manage our foreign currency exposures by utilizing foreign exchange forward contracts we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variablerate and fixedrate debt and we may utilize interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variabletototal debt ratio within targeted guidelines we principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short and longterm supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials including certain commodities and agricultural products we also enter into commodity futures options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of wheat diesel fuel natural gas soybean oil aluminum cocoa corn soybean meal and butter we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments 

the information below summarizes our market risks associated with significant financial instruments as of july 31 2022 fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 12 13 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk primarily the canadian dollar related to thirdparty transactions and intercompany transactions we utilize foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures the notional amounts of the contracts as of july 31 2022 and august 1 2021 were 153 million and 147 million respectively the aggregate fair value of all contracts was a gain of 2 million as of july 31 2022 and a loss of 2 million as of august 1 2021 a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in exchange rates would impact the fair value of our outstanding foreign exchange contracts by 17 million as of july 31 2022 and as of august 1 2021 which would generally be offset by inverse changes on the underlying hedged items 

as of july 31 2022 we had outstanding variablerate debt of 235 million with an average interest rate of 263 as of august 1 2021 we had outstanding variablerate debt of 37 million with an average interest rate of 022 a hypothetical 

100basispoint increase in average interest rates applied to our variablerate debt balances throughout 2022 and 2021 would have increased annual interest expense in those years by approximately 1 million and 3 million respectively 

as of july 31 2022 we had outstanding fixedrate debt of 4609 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 376 as of august 1 2021 we had outstanding fixedrate debt of 5059 billion with an average interest rate of 365 the fair value of fixedrate debt was 4402 billion as of july 31 2022 and 5576 billion as of august 1 2021 as of july 31 2022 and august 1 2021 a hypothetical 100basispoint increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 274 million and 399 million respectively while a hypothetical 100basispoint decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 318 million and 463 million respectively the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our longterm debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

we enter into commodity futures options and swap contracts and a supply contract under which prices for certain raw materials are established based on anticipated volume requirements to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities as of july 31 2022 the total notional amount of the contracts was 296 million and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of 7 million as of august 1 2021 the total notional amount of these contracts was 246 million and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a gain of 53 million a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in commodity prices would impact the fair value of our outstanding commodity contracts by approximately 30 million as of july 31 2022 and as of august 1 2021 which would generally be offset by inverse changes on the underlying hedged items 

we enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of the vanguard extended market index plus fund the vanguard institutional index institutional plus fund the vanguard shortterm bond index fund and the vanguard total international stock index fund prior to 2022 we had entered into swap contracts which hedged a portion of exposures linked to the total return of our capital stock as of july 31 2022 and august 1 2021 we no longer hedge our exposure linked to the total return of our capital stock the notional amount of the contracts was  50 million as of july 31 2022 and  29 million as of august 1 2021 the fair value of these contracts was a loss of 4 million as of july 31 2022 and a gain of 3 million as of august 1 2021 a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in equity price changes would impact the fair value of our outstanding swap contracts by 5 million as of july 31 2022 and 3 million as of august 1 2021 which would generally be offset by inverse changes on the underlying hedged items 

significant accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions 

trade and consumer promotion programs — we offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers such as feature price discounts instore display incentives cooperative advertising programs new product introduction fees and coupons the mix between these forms of variable consideration which are classified as reductions in revenue and recognized upon sale and advertising or other marketing activities which are classified as marketing and selling expenses fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans the measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors including expected volume typically programs that are offered have a very short duration historically the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements differences between estimates and actual costs are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period however actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates accrued trade and consumer promotion liabilities as of july 31 2022 and august 1 2021 were 141 million and 121 million respectively 

valuation of longlived assets — fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if impairment exists if impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value 

goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the 

fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill we may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a quantitative impairment test fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average costs of capital and future economic and market conditions if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value goodwill is considered impaired an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value limited to the amount of goodwill in the reporting unit 

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value fair value is determined using a relief from royalty valuation method based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates weighted average costs of capital and assumed royalty rates if the carrying value exceeds fair value an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the asset to fair value 

as of july 31 2022 the carrying value of goodwill was 3979 billion based on our assessments all of our reporting units had fair values that significantly exceeded carrying values 

as of july 31 2022 the carrying value of indefinitelived trademarks was 2549 billion as detailed below 



 

1 associated with the acquisition of snyderslance 

as of the 2022 impairment testing indefinitelived trademarks with 10 or less of excess coverage of fair value over carrying value had an aggregate carrying value of  434 million and included pacific foods and certain other snacks trademarks although assumptions are generally interdependent and do not change in isolation sensitivities to changes are provided below holding all other assumptions in our 2022 impairment testing constant changes in the assumptions below would reduce fair value of trademarks and result in impairment charges of approximately 



while the 1 changes in assumptions would not result in impairment charges on certain trademarks as indicated above some changes would reduce the excess coverage of fair value over carrying value to less than 10 for the lance and pace trademarks 

the estimates of future cash flows used in impairment testing are made at a point in time involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance assumed royalty rates economic conditions market conditions and cost of capital inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control such as changes in capital markets the actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions if assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline potential impairment charges could result we will continue to monitor the valuation of our longlived assets 

see also note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets 

pension and postretirement benefits — we provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care trend rates independent actuaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states perform the required calculations to determine expense actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in other expenses  income in the consolidated statements of 

earnings as of the measurement date which is our fiscal year end or more frequently if an interim remeasurement is required we use the fair value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on plan assets 

in establishing the discount rate we review published market indices of highquality debt securities adjusted as appropriate for duration in addition independent actuaries apply highquality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans we use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation of the relevant projected cash flows 

the expected return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering our current and projected investment mix this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation longterm projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date 

as of july 31 2022 we recognized a pension liability of 120 million and a postretirement benefit obligation of 172 million as of july 31 2022 we also recognized a pension asset of 146 million based on the funded status of certain plans 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefit expense income and actuarial losses gains included within net periodic pension and benefit expense income were as follows 



the actuarial losses recognized in 2022 were primarily due to losses on plan assets partially offset by increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation the actuarial gains recognized in 2021 were primarily due to higher than anticipated investment gains on plan assets and increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation the actuarial losses recognized in 2020 were primarily due to decreases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation partially offset by higher than anticipated investment gains on plan assets 

based on benefit obligations and plan assets as of july 31 2022 net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income excluding any actuarial losses or gains is estimated to be approximately 35 million lower in 2023 subject to the impact of interim remeasurements the decrease in 2023 is due to increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations and a decline in the market value of plan assets 

significant weightedaverage assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows 



based on benefit obligations and plan assets as of july 31 2022 estimated sensitivities to 2023 annual net periodic pension and postretirement cost are as follows 

• a 50basispoint increase in the discount rate would result in expense of approximately 6 million and would result in an immediate actuarial gain recognition of approximately 69 million 

• a 50basispoint decline in the discount rate would result in income of approximately 6 million and would result in an immediate actuarial loss recognition of approximately 76 million and 

• a 50basispoint reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would result in expense of approximately 8 million 

there were no contributions to pension plans in 2022 and 2 million in 2021 and 2020 contributions to pension plans are not expected to be material in 2023

income taxes — the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and 

liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized

ingredients and packaging 

the ingredients and packaging materials required for the manufacture of our food and beverage products are purchased from various suppliers substantially all of which are located in north america in the later part of 2021 and the early part of 2022 the costs of labor raw materials energy fuel packaging materials and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products have rapidly increased in addition many of these items are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including but not limited to climate change changes in crop size cattle cycles herd and flock disease crop disease crop pests product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations supplier capacities governmentsponsored agricultural programs and other government policy import and export requirements including tariffs drought and excessive rain temperature extremes and other adverse weather events water scarcity scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients pandemic illness such as the covid19 pandemic and other factors that may be beyond our control during the growing and harvesting seasons to help reduce some of this price volatility we use a combination of purchase orders short and longterm contracts inventory management practices and various commodity risk management tools for most of our ingredients and packaging ingredient inventories are generally at a peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only during certain seasons we make commitments for the purchase of such ingredients in their respective seasons in addition certain of the materials required for the manufacture of our products including steel and aluminum have been or may be impacted by tariffs although we are unable to predict the impact of our ability to source these ingredients and packaging materials in the future we expect these supply pressures to continue throughout 2022 we also expect the pressures of input cost inflation to continue into 2022 for information on the impact of inflation see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

customers 

in most of our markets sales and merchandising activities are conducted through our own sales force andor thirdparty brokers and distribution partners our products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains mass discounters mass merchandisers club stores convenience stores drug stores dollar stores ecommerce and other retail commercial and noncommercial establishments each of pepperidge farm and snyderslance also has a directstoredelivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors we make shipments promptly after acceptance of orders 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 46  of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2021 44 in 2020 and 43 in 2019 our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 21  of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2021 and 2020 and 20  2019 both of our reportable segments sold products to walmart stores inc or its affiliates no other customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

trademarks and technology 

as of september 15 2021 we owned over 3000 trademark registrations and applications in over 160 countries we believe our trademarks are of material importance to our business although the laws vary by jurisdiction trademarks generally are valid as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to have become generic trademark registrations generally can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use we believe that our principal brands including campbells  cape cod  chunky  emerald  goldfish  kettle brand  lance  late july  milano  pace  pacific foods  pepperidge farm  pop secret  prego  snack factory  snyders of hanover  spaghettios  swanson  and v8  are protected by trademark law in the major markets where they are used 

although we own a number of valuable patents we do not regard any segment of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents in addition we own copyrights both registered and unregistered proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories this competition arises from numerous competitors of varying sizes across multiple food and beverage categories and includes producers of private label products as well as other branded food and beverage manufacturers private label products are generally sold at lower prices than branded products competitors market and sell their products through traditional retailers and ecommerce all of these competitors vie for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars the number of competitors cannot be reliably estimated our principal areas of competition are brand recognition taste nutritional value price promotion innovation shelf space and customer service 

capital expenditures 

during 2021 our aggregate capital expenditures were 275 million we expect to spend approximately 330 million for capital projects in 2022 major capital projects based on planned spend in 2022 include a chips and cracker capacity expansion for our snacks business and a new manufacturing line for our meals  beverages business 

government regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated in the us our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies including the food and drug administration the department of agriculture the federal trade commission the department of labor the department of commerce the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the us we believe that we are in compliance with such laws and regulations in all material respects and do not expect that continued compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

environmental matters 

we have requirements for the operation and design of our facilities that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations of our 275 million in capital expenditures made during 2021 approximately 15 million were for compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the us we further estimate that approximately 14 million of the capital expenditures anticipated during 2022 will be for compliance with us environmental laws and regulations we believe that the continued compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations both within the us and elsewhere will not have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position in addition we continue to monitor existing and pending environmental laws and regulations within the us and elsewhere relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions while the impact of these laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

seasonality

in 2021 we created the campbell employee experience framework to enhance the foundational moments that are key to an employees career at our company  from the candidate experience and onboarding through career advancement  with a focus on ways of working and improving culture and inclusivity 

inclusion and diversity 

we believe that having an inclusive and diverse culture strengthens our ability to recruit talent and allows all employees to thrive and succeed diversity of input and perspectives is an essential part of our strategic plan to build a winning team and culture and we are committed to recruiting retaining and developing a workforce that reflects the diversity of the consumers we serve in 2021 we accelerated our inclusion and diversity efforts and elevated work in these areas on an enterprisewise level we continued to build out the actionable and holistic inclusion and diversity strategy we introduced in 2020 by focusing our refined strategy on three guiding pillars

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

business and operational risks 

the covid19 pandemic and related ongoing implications could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has had and could continue to have a negative impact on financial markets economic conditions and portions of our industry as a result of changes in consumer behavior retailer inventory levels cost inflation manufacturing and supply chain disruption and overall macroeconomic conditions although our business has benefited from increased athome consumption due to restrictions related to covid19 our ability to sustain heightened sales is dependent on consumer purchasing behavior the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines may partially mitigate the risks around the continued spread of covid19 however with the spread of the covid19 variants the ongoing implications of the covid19 pandemic could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways including but not limited to 

• a shutdown of one or more of our manufacturing warehousing or distribution facilities or disruption in our supply chain including but not limited to as a result of illness labor shortages government restrictions or other workforce disruptions 

• the failure of third parties on which we rely including but not limited to those that supply our packaging ingredients equipment and other necessary operating materials comanufacturers and independent contractors to meet their obligations to us or significant disruptions in their ability to do so 

• a strain on our supply chain which could result from shortterm or sustained changes and volatility in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns that increase demand at our retail customers and exceed our production capacity for our products 

• continued volatility in commodity and other input costs which may not be sufficiently offset by our commodity hedging activities 

• a disruption to our distribution capabilities or to our distribution channels including those of our suppliers contract manufacturers logistics service providers or independent distributors 

• new or escalated government or regulatory responses in markets where we manufacture sell or distribute our products or in the markets of third parties on which we rely could prevent or disrupt our business operations 

• a significant portion of our workforce including our management team could become unable to work as a result of illness or the attention of our management team could be diverted if key employees become ill from covid19 and unable to work 

• a change in demand for or availability of our products as a result of retailers distributors or carriers modifying their inventory fulfillment or shipping practices 

• an inability to effectively modify our trade promotion and advertising activities to reflect changing consumer shopping habits due to among other things reduced instore visits and travel restrictions 

• a shift in consumer spending as a result of an economic downturn could result in consumers moving to private label or lower price products and 

• continued business disruptions and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve anticipated cost savings and productivity initiatives on the original timelines 

these and other impacts of the covid19 pandemic could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors included below in this item 1a the ultimate impact depends on the severity and duration of the current covid19 pandemic including the emergence and spread of covid19 variants the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic each of which is uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict any of these disruptions could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

if we do not fully realize the expected cost savings andor operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives our profitability could suffer 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry particularly in an environment of volatile cost inputs we are pursuing multiyear cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of 850 million for continuing operations by the end of 2022 which includes 295 million in synergies and runrate cost savings from our acquisition of snyderslance these initiatives require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of these initiatives including the integration of snyderslance in an efficient and effective manner in some respects our plans to achieve these cost savings 

continue to be refined see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives for additional information on these initiatives we also regularly pursue cost productivity initiatives in addition we have recently initiated a process to drive operational excellence by transforming our supply chain capabilities to build a more resilient and agile supply chain to serve our evolving business needs while enhancing efficiency these initiatives are focused on cost savings and productivity opportunities in procurement manufacturing and logistics any failure or delaying in implementing our initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our ability to meet our longterm growth and profitability expectations and could adversely affect our business 

we may not be able to increase prices to fully offset inflationary pressures on costs such as raw and packaging materials labor and distribution costs 

as a manufacturer of food and beverage products we rely on plant labor distribution resources and raw and packaging materials including tomato paste grains beef poultry dairy potatoes and other vegetables steel aluminum glass paper and resin in the later part of 2021 and the early part of 2022 the costs of such labor raw materials energy fuel packaging materials and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products have rapidly increased in addition many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including but not limited to changes in crop size cattle cycles herd and flock disease crop disease crop pests product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations supplier capacities governmentsponsored agricultural programs and other government policy import and export requirements including tariffs drought and excessive rain temperature extremes and other adverse weather events water scarcity scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients pandemic illness such as the covid19 pandemic and other factors that may be beyond our control although we are unable to predict the impact on our ability to source materials in the future we expect these supply pressures to continue into 2022 we also expect the pressures of input cost inflation to continue into 2022 

we try to pass along to customers some or all cost increases through increases in the selling prices of or decreases in the packaging sizes of some of our products higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lowerpriced offerings or may forego some purchases altogether during an economic downturn to the extent that price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs adequately or in a timely manner andor if they result in significant decreases in sales volume our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected furthermore we may not be able to offset any cost increases through productivity initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity 

disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to manufacture andor sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing warehousing or distribution capabilities or to the capabilities of our suppliers contract manufacturers logistics service providers or independent distributors this damage or disruption could result from execution issues as well as factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as increased temperatures due to climate change water stress extreme weather events natural disasters product or raw material scarcity fire terrorism pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic strikes labor shortages cybersecurity breaches government shutdowns disruptions in logistics supplier capacity constraints or other events commodity prices have become and may continue to be more volatile during the covid19 pandemic production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought and excessive rain temperature extremes and other adverse weather events water scarcity scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients crop size cattle cycles herd and flock disease crop disease and crop pests failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur may adversely affect our business or financial results particularly in circumstances when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location disputes with significant suppliers contract manufacturers logistics service providers or independent distributors including disputes regarding pricing or performance may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture andor sell our products as well as our business or financial results 

we have experienced temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have implemented employee safety measures which exceed guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention and world health organization across all our supply chain facilities including proper hygiene enhanced sanitation social distancing mask use plexiglass dividers and temperature screenings even with these measures and the availability of vaccines given the emergence and spread of covid19 variants there is continued risk that covid19 may spread through our workforce illness labor shortages absenteeism or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain manufacturing distribution or other business processes we may face additional production disruptions in the future which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs 

shortterm or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages turnover and labor cost increases 

labor is a primary component of operating our business a number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs including high employment levels federal unemployment subsidies including unemployment benefits offered in response to the covid19 pandemic and other government regulations although we have not experienced any material labor shortage to date we have recently observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base caused by covid19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors could lead to increased costs such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business if we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a highlevel or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability such as overtime and thirdparty outsourcing have unintended negative effects our business could be adversely affected in addition we distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by truck reduced availability of trucking capacity due to shortages of drivers primarily as a result of the covid19 pandemic has caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and our suppliers an overall labor shortage lack of skilled labor increased turnover or labor inflation caused by covid19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations results of operations liquidity or cash flows 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly our trademarks to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark patent copyright and trade secret protection contractual agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results 

competing intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and timeconsuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development launch and sale of certain products any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results 

our results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is primarily based on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products packaging or ingredients whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our results could be adversely impacted 

we may be adversely impacted by a disruption failure or security breach of our information technology systems 

our information technology systems are critically important to our operations we rely on our information technology systems some of which are outsourced to third parties to manage our data communications and business processes including our marketing sales manufacturing procurement logistics customer service accounting and administrative functions and the importance of such networks and systems has increased due to an increase in our employees working remotely if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect appropriate information technology systems our business or financial results could be adversely impacted furthermore our information technology systems are subject to attack or other security breaches including the access to or acquisition of customer consumer employee or other confidential information service disruptions or other system failures if we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve these breaches disruptions or failures our operations may be impacted and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as reputational damage litigation remediation costs ransomware payments andor penalties under various data protection laws and regulations 

to address the risks to our information technology systems and the associated costs we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology and security policies cyber insurance employee training and monitoring and routine testing of our information technology systems we believe that these preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks however cyber threats are constantly evolving are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups of individuals with a wide range of expertise and 

motives which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them we have experienced threats to our data and systems and although we have not experienced a material incident to date there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber incidents 

in addition in the event our suppliers or customers experience a breach or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in our supply chain or reduced customer orders which would adversely affect our business and financial results we have also outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if these service providers do not perform effectively due to breach or system failure we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and our business may be disrupted 

we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business 

we depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we also compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results in addition activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

our results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of acquisitions divestitures and other strategic transactions 

we have historically made strategic acquisition of brands and businesses and we may undertake additional acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future our ability to meet our objectives with respect to acquisitions and other strategic transactions may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable counterparties negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected and complete those transactions potential risks also include 

• the inability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in a timely and costefficient manner including implementation of enterpriseresource planning systems 

• diversion of managements attention from other business concerns 

• potential loss of key employees suppliers andor customers of acquired businesses 

• assumption of unknown risks and liabilities 

• the inability to achieve anticipated benefits including revenues or other operating results 

• operating costs of acquired businesses may be greater than expected 

• the inability to promptly implement an effective control environment and 

• the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience 

in addition during the fourth quarter of 2021 we completed the sale of the plum baby food and snacks business and we may undertake other divestitures in the future any other businesses we decide to divest in the future may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected potential risks of divestitures may also include 

• diversion of managements attention from other business concerns 

• loss of key suppliers andor customers of divested businesses 

• the inability to separate divested businesses or business units effectively and efficiently from our existing business operations and 

• the inability to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs 

if we are unable to complete or realize the projected benefits of future acquisitions divestitures or other strategic transactions our business or financial results may be adversely impacted 

competitive and industry risks 

we face significant competition in all our product categories which may result in lower sales and margins 

we operate in the highly competitive food and beverage industry mainly in the north american market and experience competition in all of our categories the principal areas of competition are brand recognition taste nutritional value price promotion innovation shelf space and customer service a number of our primary competitors are larger than us and have substantial financial marketing and other resources and some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do in addition reduced barriers to entry and easier access to funding are creating new competition a strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts or a continued shift towards private label offerings could result in us reducing prices increasing marketing or other expenditures andor losing market share each of which may result in lower sales and margins 

our ability to compete also depends upon our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences there are inherent marketplace risks associated with new product or packaging introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance if we do not succeed in offering products that consumers want to buy our sales and market share will decrease resulting in reduced profitability if we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longlasting or are unable to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales will decline in addition given the variety of backgrounds and identities of consumers in our consumer base we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences as such we must be successful in developing innovative products across a multitude of product categories in addition the covid19 pandemic has altered and in some cases delayed product innovation efforts finally if we fail to rapidly develop products in fastergrowing and more profitable categories we could experience reduced demand for our products or fail to expand margins 

we may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customers 

our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade which has experienced slower growth than other retail channels such as dollar stores drug stores club stores and ecommerce retailers we expect this trend away from traditional retail grocery to alternate channels to continue in the future these alternative retail channels may also create consumer price deflation affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases in addition retailers with increased buying power and negotiating strength are seeking more favorable terms including increased promotional programs and customized products funded by their suppliers these customers may also use more of their shelf space for their private label products which are generally sold at lower prices than branded products if we are unable to use our scale marketing product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics our business or financial results could be adversely impacted 

in 2021 our five largest customers accounted for approximately 46  of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations with the largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounting for approximately 21  of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations there can be no assurance that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past disruption of sales to any of these customers or to any of our other large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results 

financial and economic risks 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could adversely affect our financial results and net worth 

as of august 1 2021 we had goodwill of 3981 million and other indefinitelived intangible assets of 2549 million goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise we test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including goodwill to the units fair value similarly we test indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values fair value for both goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis if the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets exceed their fair value the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair value factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates we have experienced impairment charges in prior years see significant accounting estimates and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on such impairments if current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions that could be affected by the covid19 pandemic or otherwise were to change we may be required in the future to record additional impairment of the 

carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets which could adversely affect our financial results and net worth 

we may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to our defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in the us and certain nonus locations the major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets investment returns interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we face risks related to recession financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions recession equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the us or other nations similarly disruptions in financial andor credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors and might cause us to not be able to continue to have access to preferred sources of liquidity when needed or on terms we find acceptable and our borrowing costs could increase an economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed a disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties to our derivative contracts in addition changes in tax or interest rates in the us or other nations whether due to recession economic disruptions or other reasons may adversely impact us 

legal and regulatory risks 

we may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings or claims 

we are a party to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding reportable legal proceedings since these actions are inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such proceedings or claims or that our assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection with such matters will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims in particular the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal state and foreign laws or regulations including claims relating to the presence of heavy metals in food products additionally the independent contractor distribution model which is used by pepperidge farm and snyder’slance has also come under increased regulatory scrutiny our independent contractor distribution model has also been the subject of various class and individual lawsuits in recent years in the event we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against these proceedings or claims or if our assessment of the materiality of these proceedings or claims proves inaccurate our business or financial results may be adversely affected in addition our reputation could be damaged by allegations made in proceedings or claims even if untrue furthermore actions we have taken or may take as a consequence of the covid19 pandemic may result in investigations legal claims or litigation against us 

increased regulation or changes in law could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated various laws and regulations govern the processing packaging storage distribution marketing advertising labeling quality and safety of our food products as well as the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment in the us we are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies including but not limited to the food and drug administration the department of agriculture the federal trade commission the department of labor the department of commerce the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies we are also regulated by similar agencies outside the us 

governmental and administrative bodies within the us are considering a variety of tax trade and other regulatory reforms trade reforms include tariffs on certain materials used in the manufacture of our products and tariffs on certain finished products we regularly move data across national and state borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and state to state and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements 

changes in legal or regulatory requirements such as new food safety requirements and revised regulatory requirements for the labeling of nutrition facts serving sizes and genetically modified ingredients or evolving interpretations of existing legal or 

regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance cost capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial results 

if our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled we might need to recall those items and we may experience product liability claims and damage to our reputation 

we have in the past and we may in the future need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes sickness or injury to consumers a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment a significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety andor quality of our products ingredients or packaging in addition if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in that category 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as wheat tomatoes potatoes cashews and almonds adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials lower recoveries of usable raw materials increase the prices of our raw materials increase our cost of storing and transporting our raw materials or disrupt production schedules 

we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain the increasing concern over climate change may also result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements relating to climate change including regulating greenhouse gas emissions alternative energy policies and sustainability initiatives including single use plastics in the event such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency and other sustainability goals we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of utility providers fuel emissions or fuel suppliers could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products additionally consumers and customers may put an increased priority on purchasing products that are sustainably grown and made requiring us to incur increased costs for additional transparency due diligence and reporting as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

actions of activist shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs divert managements attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our business 

we were the target of activist shareholder activities in 2019 if a new activist investor purchased our stock our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time consuming disruptive to our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees in addition perceived uncertainties as to our future direction strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist shareholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities harm our ability to attract new investors customers employees suppliers and strategic partners and cause our share price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation

executive summary 

we are a manufacturer and marketer of highquality branded food and beverage products we operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories 

in 2021 we continued to adapt and evolve in a dynamic environment as we advanced our strategic plan in the first part of the fiscal year as the covid19 pandemic reached its peak in many areas across north america we experienced significantly higher sales for our retail products in both our meals  beverages and snacks segments especially in retail chains and large grocery supermarkets this result was attributable to elevated retail demand as consumers significantly increased their food purchases for athome consumption which more than offset the declines in our foodservice business during the same period we also saw elevated repeat purchase rates and new buyers of our products especially in our soup business during the second half of 2021 we experienced lower sales in both our meals  beverages and snacks segments as we began to cycle the demand surge that accompanied the onset of the covid19 pandemic amidst intense market volatility and labor challenges we also navigated the executional pressures of a significant transformation agenda primarily in our snacks division as we begin to transition out of the covid19 environment we expect that inflation and a constrained labor market will continue to be headwinds but we expect to partially mitigate these headwinds with a pricing strategy and planned productivity and cost saving programs that will allow us to deliver on our strategic initiatives

strategy 

our strategy is to accelerate profitable growth by focusing on our core brands in two divisions within north america while delivering on the promise of our purpose  c onnecting people through food they love  our strategic plan is based on four pillars 

build a winning team and culture accelerate profitable growth fuel investments and margins with targeted cost savings and deliver on the promise of our purpose all as further discussed below 

we plan to continue our focus on building a winning team and culture by advancing our next generation work model prioritizing our inclusion and diversity strategy and investing in strategic capabilities and digitization that support our core brands in north america in addition we plan to continue to deliver on the promise of our purpose with consumer transparency initiatives progress on our sustainability goals and strengthening our connection to the communities in which we operate 

we believe that we can accelerate our profitable growth model by continuing to grow market share and drive integrated business planning programming throughout the company we expect to grow market share through the development of more consumeroriented product quality marketing and innovation plans and prioritizing growth channels and retailers within our defined portfolio roles in addition we expect to continue to focus on accelerating the growth of our snacks brands while also sustaining the growth in us soup and our other core brands we expect that changes in consumer behavior driven by the covid19 pandemic will result in ongoing elevated consumer demand for food at home relative to prepandemic levels we plan to capitalize on this opportunity by addressing evolving consumer needs through our unique and differentiated portfolio 

we also expect to fuel investments and margins by mitigating the effects of inflation through pricing and cost productivity initiatives we implemented price increases beginning in 2022 and continue to pursue our multiyear cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of 850 million for continuing operations by the end of 2022 which includes 295 million in synergies and runrate cost savings from our acquisition of snyderslance inc snyderslance see restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives for additional information on these initiatives in addition we have initiated the process to drive operational excellence by transforming our supply chain capabilities to enhance ways of working to build a more resilient and agile supply chain to serve our evolving business needs while maximizing efficiency 

business trends 

our businesses are being influenced by a variety of trends that we anticipate will continue in the future including changing consumer preferences a competitive and dynamic retail environment and cost inflation 

our strategy is designed in part to capture growing consumer preferences for snacking and convenience for example we believe that consumers are changing their eating habits by increasing the type and frequency of snacks they consume and are continuing quickscratch cooking and inhome eating behaviors that were driven by the covid19 pandemic 

retailers continue to use their buying power and negotiating strength to seek increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms including customized products funded by their suppliers any consolidations among retailers would continue to create large and sophisticated customers that may further this trend retailers also continue to grow and promote store brands that compete with branded products while other challenger brands drive innovation and engagement that threatens our market share 

the spread of the covid19 pandemic in north america has led to shifts in the growth of the retail channels in which we sell our products our products are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade which prior to the pandemic had experienced slower growth than other retail channels such as dollar stores drug stores club stores and ecommerce retailers the covid19 pandemic has shifted growth back to the traditional grocery trade although there is significant uncertainty as to how the retail channels will perform in the future we anticipate that the growth of ecommerce including omnichannel click and collect models as well as alternative retail channels such as club and dollar stores to continue 

we have continued to monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic on all aspects of our business throughout the first half of 2021 we experienced an increased demand for our retail products as consumers significantly increased their food purchases for athome consumption in response to increased demand we took steps including modifying production schedules and temporarily adjusting product mix to increase our production capacity to meet the increased demand for our retail products this demand moderated in the second half of 2021 when we lapped the initial surge in demand at the beginning of the pandemic we anticipate that 2022 will continue to be a dynamic macroeconomic environment and expect input cost inflation to be significantly higher than 2021 pricing actions and supply chain productivity initiatives introduced at the end of 2021 will mitigate a portion of this inflationary pressure but we do not expect such benefits will fully offset the incremental costs in 2022 there still remains uncertainty around the covid19 pandemic and the ultimate impact depends on the severity and duration of the pandemic including the emergence and spread of covid19 variants the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines and actions taken by government authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic

operating earnings 

segment operating earnings decreased 6 in 2021 from 2020 and increased 8 in 2020 from 2019 

an analysis of operating earnings by segment follows 



 

1 see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on restructuring charges 

operating earnings from meals  beverages decreased 9 in 2021 versus 2020 the decrease was primarily due to lower gross profit performance and sales declines partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses and administrative expenses gross profit performance was impacted by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs as well as unfavorable product mix partially offset by the benefits of supply chain productivity improvements and lower levels of promotional activity 

operating earnings from meals  beverages increased 10 in 2020 versus 2019 the increase was primarily due to sales gains including the benefit of the additional week and improved gross profit performance partially offset by increased marketing support and higher administrative expenses gross profit performance was impacted by the benefits of supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives as well as improved operating leverage and favorable product mix partially offset by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs including covid19 related costs incurred in the second half of 2020 

operating earnings from snacks decreased 3 in 2021 versus 2020 the decrease was primarily due to lower gross profit performance and sales declines partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses gross profit performance was impacted by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs partially offset by the benefits of supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives as well as lower levels of promotional spending 

operating earnings from snacks increased 6 in 2020 versus 2019 the increase primarily due to sales gains including the benefit of the additional week improved gross profit performance partially offset by increased marketing support gross profit performance was impacted by the benefits of supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives as well as favorable product mix and improved operating leverage partially offset by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs including covid19 related costs incurred in the second half of 2020 

corporate income in 2021 included the following 

• 165 million of gains on pension and postretirement benefit marktomarket adjustments 

• pension settlement gains of 38 million 

• costs of 32 million related to the cost savings initiatives and 

• a loss of 11 million from the sale of the plum baby food and snacks business 

corporate expense in 2020 included the following 

• 121 million of losses on pension and postretirement benefit marktomarket adjustments 

• a loss of 64 million from the sale of the european chips business 

• costs of 60 million related to the cost savings initiatives 

• a loss of 45 million on acre and 

• pension settlement charges of 43 million 

corporate expense in 2019 included the following

• costs of 90 million related to the cost savings initiatives 

• a pension settlement charge of 28 million and 

• noncash impairment charge of 16 million related to the european chips business 

excluding these amounts the remaining change from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to  50 million of marktomarket gains on outstanding commodity hedges in the current year 

excluding these amounts the remaining decrease in costs in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to higher other income and lower administrative expenses 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased to 210 million in 2021 from 345 million in 2020 the decrease in interest expense was due to a loss on extinguishment of debt of 75 million in the prior year and lower levels of debt 

interest expense decreased to 345 million in 2020 from 356 million in 2019 the decrease in interest expense was due to lower levels of debt and lower average interest rates on the debt portfolio partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt of 75 million 

taxes on earnings 

the effective tax rate was 246 in 2021 227 in 2020 and 242 in 2019 

the increase in the effective tax rate in 2021 from 2020 was primarily due to a 19 million deferred tax charge recognized in the second quarter of 2021 in connection with a legal entity reorganization as part of the continued integration of snyderslance and a 27 million tax benefit on the 64 million loss on the sale of the european chips business in the prior year 

the decrease in the effective rate in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to the tax benefit on the sale of the european chips business 

twoyear comparison of results from continuing operations  2021 versus 2019 

with the continued impact from the covid19 pandemic in 2021 we experienced significantly higher sales of our retail products in both our meals  beverages and snacks segments as consumers increased food purchases for athome consumption for additional context on our net sales performance and earnings from continuing operations performance 

including items impacting comparability as previously discussed see below for comparison of our current results to 2019 before the pandemic

restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives 

multiyear cost savings initiatives and snyderslance cost transformation program and integration 

beginning in fiscal 2015 we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure 

in recent years we expanded these initiatives by further optimizing our supply chain and manufacturing networks including closing our manufacturing facility in toronto ontario as well as our information technology infrastructure 

on march 26 2018 we completed the acquisition of snyderslance prior to the acquisition snyderslance launched a cost transformation program following a comprehensive review of its operations with the goal of significantly improving its financial performance we continue to implement this program in addition we have identified opportunities for additional cost synergies as we integrate snyderslance 

a summary of charges recorded in earnings from continuing operations related to these initiatives is as follows 



a summary of the pretax costs in earnings from continuing operations associated with the initiatives is as follows 



a summary of the pretax costs in earnings loss from discontinued operations associated with these initiatives is as follows 



as of april 28 2019 we incurred substantially all of the costs for actions associated with discontinued operations all of the costs were cash expenditures 

the total estimated pretax costs for actions associated with continuing operations are approximately 710 million to 730 million this estimate will be updated as costs continue to be developed the majority of the remaining costs will be incurred in 2022 

we expect the costs for actions associated with continuing operations to consist of the following approximately 220 million to 225 million in severance pay and benefits approximately 85 million in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation and approximately 405 million to 420 million in implementation costs and other related costs we expect these pretax costs to be associated with our segments as follows meals  beverages  approximately 31 snacks  approximately 45 and corporate  approximately 24 

of the aggregate 710 million to 730 million of pretax costs associated with continuing operations we expect approximately 610 million to 630 million will be cash expenditures in addition we expect to invest approximately 435 million in capital expenditures through 2022 of which we invested 401 million as of august 1 2021 the capital expenditures primarily relate to a us warehouse optimization project improvement of quality safety and cost structure across the snyder’slance manufacturing network implementation of our existing sap enterpriseresource planning system for snyderslance transition of production of the toronto manufacturing facility to our us thermal plants optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications and optimization of the snyder’slance warehouse and distribution network 

we expect to fund the costs through cash flows from operations and shortterm borrowings 

we expect the initiatives for actions associated with continuing operations once all phases are implemented to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately 850 million by the end of 2022 the annual pretax savings associated with continuing operations generated were as follows 



the initiatives for actions associated with discontinued operations generated pretax savings of over 90 million in 2019 

segment operating results do not include restructuring charges implementation costs and other related costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges a summary of the pretax costs in earnings from continuing operations associated with segments is as follows 



see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

discontinued operations 

on february 25 2019 we sold our us refrigerated soup business and on april 25 2019 we sold our garden fresh gourmet business proceeds were 55 million on june 16 2019 we sold our bolthouse farms business proceeds were 500 million beginning in the third quarter of 2019 we have reflected the results of these businesses as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented these businesses were historically included in the campbell fresh reportable segment 

we completed the sale of our kelsen business on september 23 2019 for 322 million we also completed the sale of the arnott’s and other international operations on december 23 2019 for 2286 million the purchase price was subject to certain postclosing adjustments which resulted in 4 million of additional proceeds in the third quarter of 2020 b eginning in the fourth quarter of 2019 we have reflected the results of operations of the kelsen business and the arnott’s and other international operations or campbell international as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented these businesses were historically included in the snacks reportable segment 

results of discontinued operations were as follows 



in the third quarter of 2021 we recognized a 6 million loss from discontinued operations due to tax expense from returntoprovision adjustments related to the sale of campbell international 

in 2020 campbell international sales and earnings from operations decreased reflecting the sales of the businesses 

the sale of the arnotts and other international operations resulted in a substantial capital gain for tax purposes we were able to utilize capital losses in 2020 which were offset with valuation allowances as of july 28 2019 to offset the capital gain 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 as part of our annual review of intangible assets we recognized an impairment charge of 7 million on a trademark and 10 million on goodwill in kelsen due to a lower longterm outlook for sales and the pending sale of the business 

in 2019 we recorded noncash impairment charges of 360 million 275 million after tax or 91 per share on the reporting units in campbell fresh see significant accounting estimates for additional information 

liquidity and capital resources 

we expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations longterm borrowings shortterm borrowings which may include commercial paper credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents we believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements 

we generated cash flows from operations of 1035 million in 2021 compared to 1396 million in 2020 the decline in 2021 was primarily due to changes in working capital mostly from a significant increase in accounts payable in the prior year and lower accrued liabilities in the current year 

we generated cash flows from operations of 1396 million in 2020 compared to 1398 million in 2019 the decline in 2020 was primarily due changes in working capital mostly offset by higher cash earnings and lower other cash payments 

current assets are less than current liabilities as a result of our level of current maturities of longterm debt and shortterm borrowings and our focus to lower core working capital requirements we had negative working capital of 119 million as of august 1 2021 and 690 million as of august 2 2020 total debt maturing within one year was 48 million as of august 1 2021 and 1202 million as of august 2 2020 

capital expenditures were 275 million in 2021 299 million in 2020 and 384 million in 2019 capital expenditures in 2021 were lower than 2020 due to capital expenditures associated with discontinued operations in 2020 capital expenditures in 2020 were lower than 2019 reflecting delays in certain projects impacted by the spread of the covid19 pandemic capital expenditures are expected to total approximately 330 million in 2022 capital expenditures in 2021 included the implementation of our existing sap enterpriseresource planning system for snyderslance chip capacity expansion projects a milano cookie capacity expansion project and a goldfish cracker capacity expansion project capital expenditures in 2020 included the implementation of our existing sap enterpriseresource planning system for snyderslance a milano cookie capacity expansion project chip capacity expansion projects and a goldfish cracker capacity expansion project capital expenditures in 2019 included a us warehouse optimization project replacement of a pepperidge farm refrigeration system transition of production of the toronto manufacturing facility to our us thermal plants a snyderslance regional distribution center a milano cookie capacity expansion project and a goldfish cracker capacity expansion project 

pepperidge farm and snyder’slance have a directstoredelivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors in order to maintain and expand this model we routinely purchase and sell routes the purchase and sale proceeds of the routes are reflected in investing activities 

on february 25 2019 we sold our us refrigerated soup business and on april 25 2019 we sold our garden fresh gourmet business proceeds were 55 million on june 16 2019 we sold our bolthouse farms business proceeds were 500 million

we completed the sale of the arnott’s and other international operations on december 23 2019 for 2286 million the purchase price was subject to certain postclosing adjustments which resulted in 4 million of additional proceeds in the third quarter of 2020 we used the net proceeds from the sale to reduce our debt through a series of actions on december 31 2019 we repaid the 100 million outstanding balance on our senior unsecured term loan facility on january 22 2020 we completed the redemption of all 500 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 425 senior notes due 2021 on january 24 2020 we settled tender offers to purchase 1200 million in aggregate principal amount of certain unsecured debt comprising 329 million of 330 senior notes due 2021 634 million of 365 senior notes due 2023 and 237 million of 380 senior notes due 2043 except for the 237 million of 380 senior notes due 2043 the senior notes settled under the tender offer were issued in connection with our acquisition of snyder’slance the consideration for the redemption and the tender offers was 1765 million including 65 million of premium we recognized a loss of 75 million including 65 million of premium fees and other costs paid with the tender offers and unamortized debt issuance costs which was recorded in interest expense in the consolidated statement of earnings in addition we paid accrued and unpaid interest on the purchased notes through the dates of settlement the net divestiture proceeds remaining after these debt reduction activities were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings 

on may 3 2021 we completed the sale of our plum baby food and snacks business for 101 million subject to certain postclosing adjustments 

dividend payments were 439 million in 2021 426 million in 2020 and 423 million in 2019 annual dividends declared were 146 per share in 2021 and 140 per share in 2020 and in 2019 the 2021 fourth quarter dividend was 37 per share 

we suspended our share repurchases as of the second quarter of 2018 in june 2021 the board authorized a new antidilutive share repurchase program of up to 250 million june 2021 program to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation programs the june 2021 program has no expiration date but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time repurchases under the antidilutive program may be made in openmarket or privately negotiated transactions we repurchased approximately 1 million shares at a cost of 36 million in 2021 under the june 2021 program in september 2021 the board approved a new strategic share repurchase program of up to 500 million september 2021 program the september 2021 program has no expiration date but may be suspended or discontinued at any time repurchases under the september 2021 program may be made in openmarket or privately negotiated transactions the september 2021 program replaces the suspended 1500 million share repurchase program which has been cancelled see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and market for registrants capital stock related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information 

on april 24 2020 we issued senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of 1000 million consisting of 500 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 2375 per annum due april 24 2030 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 3125 per annum due april 24 2050 on may 1 2020 we used 300 million of the net proceeds to repay 300 million of borrowings outstanding under a revolving credit facility 

in march 2021 we repaid our 330 321 million notes and floating rate 400 million notes and in may 2021 we repaid our 8875 200 million notes the repayments were funded with available cash and commercial paper issuances 

in august 2019 we repaid and terminated the aud 335 million or 227 million balance outstanding under our singledraw syndicated facility the repayment was funded through the issuance of commercial paper

we are in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit facilities and debt securities 

in september 2020 we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities under the registration statement we may issue debt securities from time to time depending on market conditions 

contractual obligations and other commitments 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contractual obligations as of august 1 2021 for additional information on debt see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements purchase commitments represent purchase orders and longterm purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients supplies machinery equipment and services these commitments are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity other longterm liabilities primarily represent payments related to deferred compensation obligations for additional information on other longterm liabilities see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 



 

1 excludes unamortized net discountpremium on debt issuances and debt issuance costs for additional information on debt obligations see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

2 includes interest payments on longterm debt and finance leases 

3 represents payments of foreign exchange forward contracts 

4 for additional information on operating leases see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

5 represents other longterm liabilities excluding unrecognized tax benefits postretirement benefits and payments related to pension plans for additional information on pension and postretirement benefits see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements and other commitments 

we guarantee approximately 4900 bank loans made to independent contractor distributors by thirdparty financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes the maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees we could be required to make is 488 million as of august 1 2021 our guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes we do not expect that we will be required to make material guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed 

inflation 

we are exposed to the impact of inflation on our cost of products sold we use a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation including increasing prices commodity hedging and pursuing cost productivity initiatives we experienced higher inflation in 2021 and expect to experience increased inflation in 2022 pricing actions and supply chain productivity initiatives introduced at the end of 2021 will mitigate a portion of this inflationary pressure but we do not expect such benefits will fully offset the incremental costs in 2022 

market risk sensitivity 

the principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices in addition we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variablerate and fixedrate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variabletototal debt ratio within targeted guidelines we manage our foreign currency exposures by utilizing foreign exchange forward contracts we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments 

we principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short and longterm supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials including certain commodities and agricultural products we also enter into commodity futures options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of wheat soybean oil diesel fuel natural gas aluminum cocoa soybean meal corn and butter 

the information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of august 1 2021 fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 12 13 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

the following table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for debt obligations interest rates disclosed on variablerate debt represent the weightedaverage rates at august 1 2021 



 

1 expected maturities exclude unamortized net discountpremium on debt issuances and debt issuance costs 

as of august 2 2020 fixedrate debt of approximately 5560 million with an average interest rate of 383 and variablerate debt of approximately 680 million with an average interest rate of 142 were outstanding 

we are exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily the canadian dollar related to thirdparty transactions and intercompany transactions we utilize foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures the notional amounts of the contracts as of august 1 2021 and august 2 2020 were 147 million and 183 million respectively the aggregate fair value of all contracts was a loss of 2 million as of august 1 2021 and a loss of 1 million as of august 2 2020 a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in exchange rates would impact the fair value of our outstanding foreign exchange contracts by 17 million as of august 1 2021 and 20 million as of august 2 2020 which would generally be offset by inverse changes on the underlying hedged items 

we enter into commodity futures options and swap contracts and a supply contract under which prices for certain raw materials are established based on anticipated volume requirements to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities as of august 1 2021 the total notional amount of the contracts was 246 million and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a gain of 53 million as of august 2 2020 the total notional amount of these contracts was 171 million and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of 2 million a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in commodity prices would impact the fair value of our outstanding commodity contracts by 30 million as of august 1 2021 and 17 million as of august 2 2020 which would generally be offset by inverse changes on the underlying hedged items 

we enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of our capital stock the total return of the vanguard institutional index institutional plus shares and the total return of the vanguard total international stock index under these contracts we pay variable interest rates and receive from the counterparty either the total return on our capital stock the total return of the standard  poors 500 index which is expected to approximate the total return of the vanguard institutional index institutional plus shares or the total return of the ishares msci eafe index which is expected to approximate the total return of the vanguard total international stock index as of june 2021 we no longer hedge our exposure linked to the total return of our capital stock the notional amount of the contracts was  29 million as of august 1 2021 and  22 million as of august 2 2020 the fair value of these contracts was a gain of 3 million as of august 1 2021 and a gain of 4 million as of august 2 2020 a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in equity price changes would impact the fair value of our outstanding swap contracts by 3 million as of august 1 2021 and august 2 2020 which would generally be offset by inverse changes on the underlying hedged items 

our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations debt repayment and debt issuances market effects on debt and foreign currency and our acquisition and divestiture activities 

significant accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions 

trade and consumer promotion programs — we offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers such as feature price discounts instore display incentives cooperative advertising programs new product introduction fees and coupons the mix between these forms of variable consideration which are classified as reductions in revenue and recognized upon sale and advertising or other marketing activities which are classified as marketing and selling expenses fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans the measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors including expected volume typically programs that are offered have a very short duration historically the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements differences between estimates and actual costs are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period however actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates 

valuation of longlived assets — fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if impairment exists if impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value 

goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is 

more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill we may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a quantitative impairment test fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average costs of capital and future economic and market conditions if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the reporting unit to fair value 

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value fair value is determined using a relief from royalty valuation method based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates weighted average costs of capital and assumed royalty rates if the carrying value exceeds fair value an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the asset to fair value 

2021 assessments 

continuing operations 

as of august 1 2021 the carrying value of goodwill was 3981 million based on our assessments all of our reporting units fair values significantly exceeded their carrying values 

as of august 1 2021 the carrying value of indefinitelived trademarks was 2549 million as detailed below 



holding all other assumptions constant changes in the assumptions below would reduce fair value of these trademarks and result in impairment charges of approximately 



while the 1 changes in assumptions would not result in impairment charges on certain trademarks as indicated above some changes would substantially reduce the excess coverage of fair value over carrying value to less than 10 for the pace pacific foods and lance trademarks the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance assumed royalty rates economic conditions market conditions and cost of capital inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control such as changes in capital markets the actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions 

if assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline potential additional impairment charges could result we will continue to monitor the valuation of our longlived assets 

2019 impairment charges 

discontinued operations 

in the first quarter of 2019 we recorded an impairment charge of 14 million on the us refrigerated soup plant assets 

on august 30 2018 we announced plans to pursue the divestiture of our international biscuits and snacks operating segment and the campbell fresh operating segment as we continued to pursue the divestiture of these businesses and as we received initial indications of value in the second quarter of 2019 we performed interim impairment assessments on the intangible and tangible assets within campbell fresh which included garden fresh gourmet bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients and bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings as a result we revised our future outlook for earnings and cash flows for each of these businesses 

within bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients we recorded impairment charges of 18 million on the trademark and 159 million on the plant assets and amortizable intangible assets within bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings we recorded impairment charges of 74 million on the trademark and 31 million on the plant assets and amortizable intangible assets on garden fresh gourmet we recorded impairment charges of 23 million on the trademark and 39 million on customer relationships which eliminated the carrying value of these assets and 2 million on plant assets

pension and postretirement benefits — we provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care trend rates independent actuaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states perform the required calculations to determine expense 

the discount rate is established as of our fiscal yearend measurement date in establishing the discount rate we review published market indices of highquality debt securities adjusted as appropriate for duration in addition independent actuaries apply highquality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans we use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation of the relevant projected cash flows 

the expected return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering our current and projected investment mix this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation longterm projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date 

net periodic pension and postretirement expense income was 267 million in 2021 93 million in 2020 and 103 million in 2019 

significant weightedaverage assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows 



estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension and postretirement cost are as follows a 50basispoint decline in the discount rate would result in income of approximately 10 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of approximately 113 million a 50basispoint reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would result in expense of approximately 12 million 

contributions to pension plans were 2 million in 2021 and 2020 and 5 million in 2019 contributions to pension plans are not expected to be material in 2022 

see also note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement benefits 

income taxes — the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized

ingredients and packaging 

the ingredients and packaging materials required for the manufacture of our food and beverage products are purchased from various suppliers substantially all of which are located in north america these items are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including climate change changes in crop size cattle cycles herd and flock disease crop disease crop pests product scarcity pandemics demand for raw materials supplier capacities commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations governmentsponsored agricultural programs and other government policy import and export requirements including tariffs drought and excessive rain temperature extremes and other adverse weather events water scarcity scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients and other factors that may be beyond our control during the growing and harvesting seasons to help reduce some of this price volatility we use a combination of purchase orders short and longterm contracts inventory management practices and various commodity risk management tools for most of our ingredients and packaging ingredient inventories are generally at a peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only during certain seasons we make commitments for the purchase of such ingredients in their respective seasons in addition certain of the materials required for the manufacture of our products including steel and aluminum have been or may be impacted by tariffs despite our ability to source raw materials necessary to meet increased demand for our products certain ingredients and packaging including steel aluminum glass agricultural products proteins and other commodities have been adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic although we are unable to predict the impact to our ability to source these materials in the future we expect these supply pressures to continue throughout 2021 for information on the impact of inflation see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

customers 

in most of our markets sales and merchandising activities are conducted through our own sales force andor thirdparty brokers and distribution partners our products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains mass discounters mass merchandisers club stores convenience stores drug stores dollar stores ecommerce and other retail commercial and noncommercial establishments each of pepperidge farm and snyderslance also has a directstoredelivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors we make shipments promptly after acceptance of orders in the second half of 2020 we experienced increased demand in our retail businesses as the covid19 pandemic and related governmental restrictions resulted in a significant increase in athome food consumption we have taken steps including modifying production schedules and temporarily adjusting product mix to increase our production capacity to meet the increased demand for our retail products notwithstanding these efforts we have been and continue to be unable to fulfill all orders we receive from our customers for additional information on covid19 impacts see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories this competition arises from numerous competitors of varying sizes across multiple food and beverage categories and includes producers of private label products as well as other branded food and beverage manufacturers private label products are generally sold at lower prices than branded products competitors market and sell their products through traditional retailers and ecommerce all of these competitors vie for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars the number of competitors cannot be reliably estimated our principal areas of competition are brand recognition taste nutritional value price promotion innovation shelf space and customer service 

working capital 

for information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital items see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources 

capital expenditures 

during 2020 our aggregate capital expenditures were 299 million we expect to spend approximately 350 million for capital projects in 2021 major capital projects based on planned spend in 2021 include implementation of an sap enterpriseresource planning system for snyderslance which was delayed from 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic and a new manufacturing line for our snacks business 

regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated in the us our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies including the food and drug administration department of agriculture federal trade commission department of labor department of commerce and environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the us in addition the current us administration has implemented and is considering tariffs on certain imported commodities including steel and aluminum in response other countries have adopted andor are considering countervailing tariffs on imported food and agriculture products 

environmental matters 

we have requirements for the operation and design of our facilities that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations of our 299 million in capital expenditures made during 2020 approximately 6 million were for compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the us we further estimate that approximately 13 million of the capital expenditures anticipated during 2021 will be for compliance with us environmental laws and regulations we believe that continued compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations both within the us and elsewhere will not have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position in addition we continue to monitor existing and pending environmental laws and regulations within the us and elsewhere relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions while the impact of these laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

seasonality 

demand for soup products is seasonal with the fall and winter months usually accounting for the highest sales volume this year due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic demand for soup products was above normal levels during the spring and summer months demand for our other products is generally evenly distributed throughout the year

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

operational risk factors 

the outbreak of covid19 and associated responses could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic activity and markets throughout the world in response governmental authorities have implemented numerous measures in an attempt to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns although our business has benefitted from some of these measures the impact and associated responses of the covid19 pandemic could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways including but not limited to 

• a shutdown of one or more of our manufacturing warehousing or distribution facilities or disruption in our supply chain including but not limited to as a result of illness government restrictions or other workforce disruptions 

• the failure of third parties on which we rely including but not limited to those that supply our packaging ingredients equipment and other necessary operating materials comanufacturers and independent contractors to meet their obligations to us or significant disruptions in their ability to do so 

• a strain on our supply chain which could result from continued increased retailer and consumer demand for our products 

• a disruption to our distribution capabilities or to our distribution channels including those of our suppliers contract manufacturers logistics service providers or independent distributors 

• reductions in the availability of one or more of our products as we prioritize the production of other products due to increased demand 

• new or escalated government or regulatory responses in markets where we manufacture sell or distribute our products or in the markets of third parties on which we rely could prevent or disrupt our business operations 

• continued commodity cost volatility which may not be sufficiently offset by our commodity hedging activities 

• a significant portion of our workforce including our management team could become unable to work as a result of illness or the attention of our management team could be diverted if key employees become ill from covid19 and unable to work 

• higher costs in certain areas such as frontline employee compensation and independent contractor payments as well as incremental costs associated with newly added health screenings temperature checks and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees and product quality standards which could continue or could increase in these or other areas 

• the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness quarantine or other travel restrictions or financial hardship or decrease in demand due to the easing of governmental authority restrictions and business closings or decrease in pantryloading activity 

• a change in demand for or availability of our products as a result of retailers distributors or carriers modifying their inventory fulfillment or shipping practices 

• an inability to effectively modify our trade promotion and advertising activities to reflect changing consumer shopping habits due to among other things reduced instore visits and travel restrictions 

• a shift in consumer spending as a result of an economic downturn could result in consumers moving to private label or lower price products 

• an increased reliance on our information technology systems due to many employees working remotely causing us to be increasingly subject to cyberattack 

• a continued decrease in demand at restaurants or other away from home dining establishments resulting from government restrictions and social distancing measures which adversely affects our foodservice business and 

• continued business disruptions and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve anticipated cost savings and productivity initiatives on the original timelines 

these and other impacts of the covid19 pandemic could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors included below in this item 1a the ultimate impact depends on the severity and duration of the current covid19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response each of which is uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict any of these disruptions could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we face significant competition in all our product categories which may result in lower sales and margins 

we operate in the highly competitive food and beverage industry mainly in the north american market and experience competition in all of our categories the principal areas of competition are brand recognition taste nutritional value price promotion innovation shelf space and customer service a number of our primary competitors are larger than us and have substantial financial marketing and other resources and some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do in addition reduced barriers to entry and easier access to funding are creating new competition a strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts or a continued shift towards private label offerings could result in us reducing prices increasing marketing or other expenditures andor losing market share each of which may result in lower sales and margins 

our ability to compete also depends upon our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences there are inherent marketplace risks associated with new product or packaging introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance if we do not succeed in offering products that consumers want to buy our sales and market share will decrease resulting in reduced profitability if we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longlasting or are unable to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales will decline in addition given the variety of backgrounds and identities of consumers in our consumer base we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences as such we must be successful in developing innovative products across a multitude of product categories in addition the covid19 pandemic has altered and in some cases delayed product innovation efforts finally if we fail to rapidly develop products in fastergrowing and more profitable categories we could experience reduced demand for our products or fail to expand margins 

we may not achieve our targeted cost savings which may adversely affect our ability to grow margins 

we are pursuing multiyear cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of 850 million for continuing operations by the end of 2022 which includes 295 million in synergies and runrate cost savings from our acquisition of snyderslance these initiatives require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of these initiatives including the integration of snyderslance in an efficient and effective manner in some respects our plans to achieve these cost savings continue to be refined see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives for additional information on these initiatives we have recently delayed the implementation of system upgrades and certain other costsaving and productivity initiatives due to the covid19 pandemic continued disruptions and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve our cost savings and productivity initiatives on the same timelines these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from other business issues have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from these often complex initiatives any failure to or delay in implementing our initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our ability to grow margins 

we may not be able to increase prices to fully offset increases in prices of raw and packaging materials or distribution costs 

as a manufacturer of food and beverage products the raw and packaging materials used in our business include tomato paste grains beef poultry dairy potatoes and other vegetables steel aluminum glass paper and resin many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including but not limited to changes in crop size cattle cycles herd and flock disease crop disease crop pests product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations supplier capacities governmentsponsored agricultural programs and other government policy import and export requirements including tariffs drought and excessive rain temperature extremes and other adverse weather events water scarcity scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients pandemic illness such as the covid19 pandemic and other factors that may be beyond our control despite our ability to source raw materials necessary to meet increased demand for our products certain ingredients and packaging including steel aluminum glass agricultural products proteins and other commodities have been adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic although we are unable to predict the impact to our ability to source these materials in the future we expect these supply pressures to continue into 2021 the cost of distribution decreased in 2020 due to a decline in transportation and logistics costs driven by excess availability warehousing efficiencies and lower fuel costs however we have experienced a recent increase in 

transportation and logistics costs we may not be able to offset any price increases through productivity or price increases or through our commodity hedging activity 

we try to pass along to customers some or all cost increases through increases in the selling prices of or decreases in the packaging sizes of some of our products higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lowerpriced offerings or may forego some purchases altogether during an economic downturn to the extent that price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs andor if they result in significant decreases in sales volume our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customers 

our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade which has experienced slower growth than other retail channels such as dollar stores drug stores club stores and ecommerce retailers we expect this trend away from traditional retail grocery to alternate channels to continue in the future these alternative retail channels may also create consumer price deflation affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases in addition retailers with increased buying power and negotiating strength are seeking more favorable terms including increased promotional programs and customized products funded by their suppliers these customers may also use more of their shelf space for their private label products which are generally sold at lower prices than branded products if we are unable to use our scale marketing product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics our business or financial results could be adversely impacted 

in 2020 our five largest customers accounted for approximately 44  of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations with the largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounting for approximately 21  of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in addition the kroger co and its affiliates accounted for approximately 9  of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2020 there can be no assurance that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past disruption of sales to any of these customers or to any of our other large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results 

our results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is primarily based on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products packaging or ingredients whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our results could be adversely impacted 

disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to manufacture andor sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing warehousing or distribution capabilities or to the capabilities of our suppliers contract manufacturers logistics service providers or independent distributors this damage or disruption could result from execution issues as well as factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as increased temperatures due to climate change water stress extreme weather events natural disasters product or raw material scarcity fire terrorism pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic strikes cybersecurity breaches government shutdowns disruptions in logistics supplier capacity constraints or other events commodity prices have become and may continue to be more volatile during the covid19 pandemic production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought and excessive rain temperature extremes and other adverse weather events water scarcity scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients crop size cattle cycles herd and flock disease crop disease and crop pests failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur may adversely affect our business or financial results particularly in circumstances when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location disputes with significant suppliers contract manufacturers logistics service providers or independent distributors including disputes regarding pricing or performance may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture andor sell our products as well as our business or financial results 

we have experienced minor temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have implemented employee safety measures which exceed guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention 

and world health organization across all our supply chain facilities including proper hygiene enhanced sanitation social distancing mask use plexiglass dividers and temperature screenings even with these measures there is risk that covid19 may spread through our workforce illness travel restrictions absenteeism or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain manufacturing distribution or other business processes we may face additional production disruptions in the future which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs 

we experienced increased demand for our products in the second half of 2020 shortterm or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are actively monitoring the continued spread of the covid19 pandemic and its ongoing impact on our supply chain and operations however we are unable to accurately predict the future impact that the covid19 pandemic will have due to various uncertainties including the ultimate geographic spread of the virus the severity of the virus the duration of the outbreak and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities 

if our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled we might need to recall those items and we may experience product liability claims and damage to our reputation 

we have in the past and we may in the future need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes sickness or injury to consumers a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment a significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety andor quality of our products ingredients or packaging in addition if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in that category 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could adversely affect our financial results and net worth 

as of august 2 2020 we had goodwill of 3986 million and other indefinitelived intangible assets of 2611 million goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise we test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including goodwill to the units fair value similarly we test indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values fair value for both goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis if the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets exceed their fair value the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair value factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates we have experienced impairment charges in prior years see significant accounting estimates and notes 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on such impairments if current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions that could be affected by the covid19 pandemic or otherwise were to change we may be required in the future to record additional impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets which could adversely affect our financial results and net worth 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly our trademarks to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark patent copyright and trade secret protection contractual agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results 

competing intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and timeconsuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development launch and sale of certain products any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results 

we may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to our defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in the us and certain nonus locations the major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets investment returns interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we may be adversely impacted by a failure or security breach of our information technology systems 

our information technology systems are critically important to our operations we rely on our information technology systems some of which are outsourced to third parties to manage our data communications and business processes including our marketing sales manufacturing procurement logistics customer service accounting and administrative functions and the importance of such networks and systems has increased due to many of our employees working remotely as a result of the covid19 pandemic if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect appropriate information technology systems our business or financial results could be adversely impacted furthermore our information technology systems are subject to attack or other security breaches including the access to or acquisition of customer consumer employee or other confidential information service disruptions or other system failures if we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve these breaches disruptions or failures our operations may be impacted and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as reputational damage litigation remediation costs andor penalties under various data protection laws and regulations 

to address the risks to our information technology systems and the associated costs we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology and security policies cyber insurance employee training and monitoring and routine testing of our information technology systems we believe that these preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks although we have not experienced a material incident to date there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident the cost to remediate damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber attack could be significant 

in addition in the event our suppliers or customers experience a breach or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in our supply chain or reduced customer orders which would adversely affect our business and financial results we have also outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if these service providers do not perform effectively due to breach or system failure we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and our business may be disrupted 

we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business 

we depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we also compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results in addition activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results we also recently streamlined our business into a twodivision operating model which could lead to operational challenges and higher employee turnover 

our results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of acquisitions divestitures and other strategic transactions 

we have historically made strategic acquisition of brands and businesses and we may undertake additional acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future our ability to meet our objectives with respect to acquisitions and other strategic transactions may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable counterparties negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected and complete those transactions potential risks also include 

• the inability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in a timely and costefficient manner including implementation of enterpriseresource planning systems 

• diversion of managements attention from other business concerns 

• potential loss of key employees suppliers andor customers of acquired businesses 

• assumption of unknown risks and liabilities 

• the inability to achieve anticipated benefits including revenues or other operating results 

• operating costs of acquired businesses may be greater than expected 

• the inability to promptly implement an effective control environment and 

• the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience 

in addition during the first half of 2020 we completed the sale of our kelsen business and the arnott’s and other international operations and we may undertake other divestitures in the future any other businesses we decide to divest in the future may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected potential risks of divestitures may also include 

• diversion of managements attention from other business concerns 

• loss of key suppliers andor customers of divested businesses 

• the inability to separate divested businesses or business units effectively and efficiently from our existing business operations and 

• the inability to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs 

if we are unable to complete or realize the projected benefits of future acquisitions divestitures or other strategic transactions our business or financial results may be adversely impacted 

market conditions and other general risk factors 

we face risks related to recession financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions recession equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the us or other nations similarly disruptions in financial andor credit markets the risk of which has been heightened due to the covid19 pandemic may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors and might cause us to not be able to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when we would like and our borrowing costs could increase the covid19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets we may not have access to preferred sources of liquidity when needed or on terms we find acceptable and our borrowing costs could increase an economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed a disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties to our derivative contracts in addition changes in tax or interest rates in the us or other nations whether due to recession economic disruptions or other reasons may adversely impact us 

the administering regulatory authority regulating the london interbank offered rate libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of december 2021 our variable rate debt and revolving credit facility use libor as a benchmark for establishing interest rates while we expect to have paid off our variablerate debt and replaced or renegotiated our revolving credit facility by the end of december 2021 we may incur additional indebtedness andor negotiate new credit terms that will rely on an alternative interest rate method to libor any legal or regulatory changes made in response to libor’s future discontinuance may result in among other things a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in libor a delay in the publication of libor or changes in the rules or methodologies in libor in addition alternative methods to libor may not yet have been established by the end of december 2021 and the impact of such alternative methods may be impossible or impracticable to determine while we do not expect that the transition from libor and risks related thereto will have a material adverse effect on our financing costs it is still uncertain at this time 

actions of activist shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs divert managements attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our business 

we were the target of activist shareholder activities in 2019 if a new activist investor purchased our stock our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and timeconsuming disruptive to our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees in addition perceived uncertainties as to our future direction strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist shareholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities harm our ability to attract new investors customers employees suppliers and other strategic partners and cause our share price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation 

legal and regulatory risk factors 

we may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings or claims 

we are a party to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding reportable legal proceedings since these actions are inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such proceedings or claims or that our assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection with such matters will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims in particular the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal state and foreign laws or regulations additionally the independent contractor distribution model which is used by pepperidge farm and snyder’slance has also come under increased regulatory scrutiny our independent contractor distribution model has also been the subject of various class and individual lawsuits in recent years in the event we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against these proceedings or claims or if our assessment of the materiality of these proceedings or claims proves inaccurate our business or financial results may be adversely affected in addition our reputation could be damaged by allegations made in proceedings or claims even if untrue furthermore actions we have taken or may take or decisions we have made or may make as a consequence of the covid19 pandemic may result in investigations legal claims or litigation against us 

increased regulation or changes in law could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated various laws and regulations govern the processing packaging storage distribution marketing advertising labeling quality and safety of our food products as well as the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment in the us we are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies including but not limited to the food and drug administration the department of agriculture the federal trade commission the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies we are also regulated by similar agencies outside the us 

governmental and administrative bodies within the us are considering a variety of tax trade and other regulatory reforms trade reforms include tariffs on certain materials used in the manufacture of our products and tariffs on certain finished products we regularly move data across national and state borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and state to state and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements 

changes in legal or regulatory requirements such as new food safety requirements and revised regulatory requirements for the labeling of nutrition facts serving sizes and genetically modified ingredients or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance cost capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial results

overview

unless otherwise stated the terms we us our and the company refer to campbell soup company and its consolidated subsidiaries 

executive summary 

we are a manufacturer and marketer of highquality branded food and beverage products we operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories 

2020 illustrated the importance of a focused strategic plan and a dynamic team as we faced the unprecedented challenges of the covid19 pandemic the year can be viewed in two clear and separate halves the first half of 2020 was a period of steady execution against our strategic roadmap we began the year focused on strengthening our brand powerhouse with two distinct divisions concentrated in north america meals  beverages and snacks each home to strong portfolios of products we kicked off our “win in soup” strategic plan and completed our planned divestitures of our campbell international and european chips business using the proceeds to reduce our leverage while implementing a new operating model to optimize growth and profitability the groundwork we established in the first half of 2020 served as a springboard for the business into the second half of the year when progress against our strategy accelerated as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

with the spread of the covid19 pandemic in north america during the second half of 2020 we experienced significantly higher sales for our retail products in both our meals  beverages and snacks segments especially in retail chains and large grocery supermarkets this result was attributable to a change in retail demand as consumers significantly increased their current food purchases for athome consumption which more than offset the declines in our foodservice business during the same period we also saw elevated repeat purchase rates and new buyers of our products especially in our soup business the higher sales trends of our retail products may lessen or reverse in 2021 if customers or consumers alter their purchasing habits 

in response to increased demand for our retail products during the second half of 2020 we have taken steps including modifying production schedules and temporarily adjusting product mix to increase our production capacity to meet the increased demand for our retail products during the second half of 2020 we also experienced higher costs in certain areas such as frontline employee compensation and independent contractor payments as well as incremental costs associated with newly added health screenings temperature checks and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees and product quality standards which may continue or increase in 2021 

overall we benefited from increased product demand and favorable product mix as we leveraged our supply chain assets to respond to the impact of the pandemic consequently our fullyear results significantly exceeded our initial annual targets for net sales and earnings from continuing operations 

in 2019 we sold our us refrigerated soup business our garden fresh gourmet business and our bolthouse farms business beginning in the third quarter of 2019 we have reflected the results of operations of these businesses as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented these businesses were historically included in the campbell fresh reportable segment a portion of the us refrigerated soup business historically included in campbell fresh was retained and is now reported in meals  beverages 

as discussed above we completed the sale of our kelsen business on september 23 2019 on december 23 2019 we completed the sale of our arnott’s business and certain other international operations including the simple meals and shelfstable beverages businesses in australia and asia pacific the arnotts and other international operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019 we have reflected the results of operations of the kelsen business and the arnott’s and other international operations collectively referred to as campbell international as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented these businesses were historically included in the snacks reportable segment in addition on october 11 2019 we completed the sale of our european chips business the results of the european chips business through the date of sale were reflected in continuing operations within the snacks reportable segment see notes 3 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these divestitures and reportable segments 

through the fourth quarter of 2019 our retail business in latin america was managed as part of the meals  beverages segment beginning in 2020 our business in latin america is managed as part of the snacks segment segment results have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation 

strategy 

our strategy is to deliver profitable growth by focusing on our core brands in two divisions within north america while delivering on the promise of our purpose  real food that matters for life’s moments  our strategic plan is based on four pillars create a profitable growth model fuel investments and margins with targeted cost savings build a winning team and culture and deliver on the promise of our purpose all as further discussed below 

we plan to continue to build upon our consumer and customer engagement models which we believe will enhance our profitable growth model we plan to do this through the development of more consumeroriented product quality marketing and innovation plans and prioritizing channels and retailers within our defined portfolio roles in addition we expect to continue to focus on the growth of our snacks business while also investing in us soup and our other core brands 

we also expect to continue pursuing our multiyear cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of 850 million for continuing operations by the end of 2022 which includes 295 million in synergies and runrate cost savings from our acquisition of snyderslance inc snyderslance we expect to achieve these additional savings with continued network optimization organization consolidation and integration procurement savings and incremental savings opportunities across several cost categories see restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives for additional information on these initiatives 

we also plan to focus on building a winning team and culture by improving our employee experience advancing our inclusion and diversity strategy and investing in strategic capabilities that support our core brands in north america in addition we plan to continue to deliver on the promise of our purpose with consumer transparency initiatives progress on our sustainability goals and strengthening our connection to the communities in which we operate 

business trends 

our businesses are being influenced by a variety of trends that we anticipate will continue in the future including changing consumer preferences a competitive and dynamic retail environment and cost inflation 

our strategy is designed in part to capture growing consumer preferences for snacking and convenience for example we believe that consumers are changing their eating habits by increasing the type and frequency of snacks they consume we also expect consumers to continue to seek products that they associate with health and wellbeing including naturally functional and organic foods as well as plantbased foods 

retailers continue to use their buying power and negotiating strength to seek increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms including increased promotional programs and customized products funded by their suppliers any consolidations among retailers would continue to create large and sophisticated customers that may further this trend retailers also continue to grow and promote store brands that compete with branded products while other challenger brands drive innovation and engagement that threatens our market share 

the spread of the covid19 pandemic in north america has led to shifts in the growth of the retail channels in which we sell our products our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade which prior to the pandemic had experienced slower growth than other retail channels such as dollar stores drug stores club stores and ecommerce retailers the covid19 pandemic has shifted growth back to the traditional grocery trade although there is significant uncertainty as to how the retail channels will perform in the future we anticipate that the growth of ecommerce including omnichannel click and collect models as well as alternative retail channels such as club and dollar stores to continue 

the spread of the covid19 pandemic also resulted in increased demand for our retail products as consumers significantly increased their current food purchases for athome consumption in response to increased demand for our retail products during the second half of 2020 we have taken steps including modifying production schedules and temporarily adjusting product mix to increase our production capacity to meet the increased demand for our retail products the continued spread of the covid19 pandemic and any resulting government stayathome orders in the united states in 2021 may continue to drive consumer demand for our products which may be in excess of our ability to supply in mitigating supply chain risks associated with the covid19 pandemic we experienced higher costs in certain areas such as frontline employee compensation and independent contractor payments as well as incremental costs associated with newly added health screenings temperature checks and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees and product quality standards which may continue or increase in 2021 

the cost of distribution decreased in 2020 due to a decline in transportation and logistics costs driven by excess availability warehousing efficiencies and lower fuel costs however we have experienced a recent increase in transportation and logistics costs despite our ability to source raw materials necessary to meet increased demand for our products certain ingredients and packaging including steel aluminum glass agricultural products proteins and other commodities have been adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic although we are unable to predict the impact to our ability to source these materials in the future with any certainty we expect these supply pressures to continue into 2021

there were 53 weeks in 2020 there were 52 weeks in 2019 and 2018 

• net sales increased 7 in 2020 to 8691 million primarily due to gains in meals  beverages and snacks the 53 rd week contributed 2 points of growth which was mostly offset by the impact of the divestiture of the european chips business as a result of covid19 net sales accelerated in our retail products in the second half of 2020 with increased demand of food purchases for athome consumption partly offset by declines in foodservice as a result of shifts in consumer behavior and continued covid19 restrictions

operating earnings 

segment operating earnings increased 8 in 2020 from 2019 and increased 3 in 2019 from 2018 

an analysis of operating earnings by segment follows 



 

1 see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on restructuring charges 

operating earnings from meals  beverages increased 10 in 2020 versus 2019 the increase was primarily due to sales volume gains including the benefit of the additional week and improved gross profit performance partially offset by increased marketing support and higher administrative expenses gross profit performance was impacted by the benefits of supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives as well as improved operating leverage and favorable product mix partially offset by cost inflation and other supply chain costs including covid19 related costs incurred in the second half of 2020 

operating earnings from meals  beverages decreased 9 in 2019 versus 2018 the decrease was primarily due to higher levels of cost inflation and higher warehousing and transportation costs as well as higher promotional spending and higher incentive compensation expenses partly offset by supply chain productivity improvements lower marketing and selling expenses and the benefits of cost savings initiatives 

operating earnings from snacks increased 6 in 2020 versus 2019 the increase primarily due to sales volume gains including the benefit of the additional week improved gross profit performance partially offset by increased marketing support gross profit performance was impacted by the benefits of supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives as well as favorable product mix and improved operating leverage partially offset by cost inflation and other supply chain costs including covid19 related costs incurred in the second half of 2020 

operating earnings from snacks increased 33 in 2019 versus 2018 the increase reflects a 31point benefit from the acquisition of snyder’slance the remaining increase was primarily due to higher sales supply chain productivity improvements and lower promotional spending partly offset by higher marketing and selling expenses higher levels of cost inflation and higher incentive compensation expenses operating earnings benefited from lapping the costs associated with the voluntary product recall of flavor blasted goldfish crackers in july 2018 

corporate in 2020 included the following 

• 121 million of losses on pension and postretirement benefit marktomarket adjustments 

• a loss of 64 million from the sale of the european chips business

• transaction and integration costs of 107 million associated with the acquisition of snyderslance 

• noncash impairment charge of 54 million related to the plum trademark 

• 22 million of expense related to the settlement of a legal claim and 

• 131 million of gains on pension and postretirement benefit marktomarket adjustments 

excluding these amounts the remaining decrease in costs in 2020 primarily reflects higher other income and lower administrative expenses 

excluding these amounts the remaining increase in costs in 2019 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expenses 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased to 345 million in 2020 from 356 million in 2019 the decrease in interest expense was due to lower levels of debt and lower average interest rates on the debt portfolio partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt of 75 million 

interest expense increased to 356 million in 2019 from 183 million in 2018 the increase in interest expense was due to higher levels of debt associated with funding the acquisitions higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio and a gain of 18 million on treasury rate lock contracts in 2018 used to hedge the planned financing of the snyderslance acquisition 

taxes on earnings 

the effective tax rate was 227 in 2020 242 in 2019 and 128 in 2018 

the decrease in the effective rate in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to the tax benefit on the sale of the european chips business 

on december 22 2017 the act was enacted into law and made significant changes to corporate taxation as a result the following items are reflected in 2018 

• the corporate rate reduction as of january 1 2018 resulted in a blended us statutory tax rate of approximately 27 

• remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in a tax benefit of 179 million and 

• imposition of a transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings resulted in a tax charge of 53 million 

see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

tax expense increased from 106 million in 2018 to 151 million in 2019 

the following items impacted 2019 and 2018 

• in 2019 we recognized a tax benefit of 29 million on 122 million of pension and postretirement benefit marktomarket losses in 2018 we recognized tax expense of 31 million on 131 million of pension and postretirement benefit marktomarket gains 

• in 2019 we recognized a 6 million tax benefit on 28 million of a pension settlement charge 

• in 2019 we recognized a 29 million tax benefit on 121 million of restructuring charges implementation costs and other related costs in 2018 we recognized a 45 million tax benefit on 177 million of restructuring charges implementation costs and other related costs 

• in 2019 we recognized a transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings of 2 million related to the enactment of the act in 2018 we recognized a net tax benefit of 126 million related to the enactment of the act on the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings described above 

• in 2019 we recognized a 3 million tax benefit on a 16 million impairment charge on the european chips business in 2018 we recognized a 13 million tax benefit on a 54 million impairment charge on the plum trademark 

• in 2018 we recognized a 29 million tax benefit on 102 million of transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of snyderslance and 

• in 2018 we recognized a 7 million tax benefit on the 22 million of expense related to the settlement of a legal claim 

after adjusting for the items above the remaining decrease in the effective rate in 2019 was primarily due to the ongoing benefit of the lower us federal tax rate resulting from the enactment of the act 

restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives 

multiyear cost savings initiatives and snyderslance cost transformation program and integration 

beginning in fiscal 2015 we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure 

in recent years we expanded these initiatives by further optimizing our supply chain and manufacturing networks including closing our manufacturing facility in toronto ontario as well as our information technology infrastructure 

on march 26 2018 we completed the acquisition of snyderslance prior to the acquisition snyderslance launched a cost transformation program following a comprehensive review of its operations with the goal of significantly improving its financial performance we continue to implement this program in addition we have identified opportunities for additional cost synergies as we integrate snyderslance 

cost estimates as well as timing for certain activities are continuing to be developed 

a summary of pretax charges recorded in earnings from continuing operations related to these initiatives is as follows 



a summary of the pretax charges recorded in earnings loss from discontinued operations is as follows 



 

1 includes 19 million of severance pay and benefits and 4 million of implementation costs and other related costs 

as of april 28 2019 we incurred substantially all of the costs for actions associated with discontinued operations all of the costs were cash expenditures 

a summary of the pretax costs in earnings from continuing operations associated with the initiatives is as follows 



the total estimated pretax costs for actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified are approximately 665 million to 690 million this estimate will be updated as costs for the expanded initiatives are developed 

we expect the costs for actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified to date to consist of the following approximately 215 million to 220 million in severance pay and benefits approximately 70 million in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation and approximately 380 million to 400 million in implementation costs and other related costs we expect these pretax costs to be associated with our segments as follows meals  beverages  approximately 33 snacks  approximately 42 and corporate  approximately 25 

of the aggregate 665 million to 690 million of pretax costs associated with continuing operations identified to date we expect approximately 585 million to 610 million will be cash expenditures in addition we expect to invest approximately 420 million in capital expenditures through 2022 of which we invested 336 million as of august 2 2020 the capital expenditures primarily relate to the us warehouse optimization project improvement of quality safety and cost structure across the snyder’slance manufacturing network implementation of an sap enterpriseresource planning system for snyderslance optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications transition of production of the toronto manufacturing facility to our us thermal plants insourcing of manufacturing for certain simple meal products and optimization of the snyder’slance warehouse and distribution network 

we expect to incur substantially all of the costs for the actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified to date through 2021 and to fund the costs through cash flows from operations and shortterm borrowings 

we expect the initiatives for actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified to date to generate pretax savings of approximately 800 million to 810 million in 2021 and once all phases are implemented to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately 850 million by the end of 2022 the annual pretax savings associated with continuing operations generated were as follows 



the initiatives for actions associated with discontinued operations generated pretax savings of over 90 million in 2019 and 60 million in 2018 

segment operating results do not include restructuring charges implementation costs and other related costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges a summary of the pretax costs in earnings from continuing operations associated with segments is as follows

discontinued operations 

on february 25 2019 we sold our us refrigerated soup business and on april 25 2019 we sold our garden fresh gourmet business proceeds were 55 million on june 16 2019 we sold our bolthouse farms business proceeds were 500 million beginning in the third quarter of 2019 we have reflected the results of these businesses as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented these businesses were historically included in the campbell fresh reportable segment 

we completed the sale of our kelsen business on september 23 2019 for 322 million we also completed the sale of the arnott’s and other international operations on december 23 2019 for 2286 million the purchase price was subject to certain postclosing adjustments which resulted in 4 million of additional proceeds in the third quarter of 2020 b eginning in the fourth quarter of 2019 we have reflected the results of operations of the kelsen business and the arnott’s and other international operations or campbell international as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented these businesses were historically included in the snacks reportable segment 

results of discontinued operations were as follows 



in 2020 campbell international sales and earnings from operations decreased reflecting the sales of the businesses 

the sale of the arnotts and other international operations resulted in a substantial capital gain for tax purposes we were able to utilize capital losses which were offset with valuation allowances as of july 28 2019 to offset the capital gain 

in 2019 campbell international sales decreased reflecting the negative impact of currency translation and declines in kelsen cookies in the us 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 as part of our annual review of intangible assets we recognized an impairment charge of 7 million on a trademark and 10 million on goodwill in kelsen due to a lower longterm outlook for sales and the pending sale of the business 

in 2019 excluding items impacting comparability earnings from campbell international declined primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage reflecting higher supply chain costs and higher promotional spending as well as the negative impact of currency translation 

in 2019 campbell fresh sales decreased primarily due to the sale of the businesses as well as declines in refrigerated soup bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and garden fresh gourmet 

in 2019 and 2018 we recorded impairment charges on the reporting units in campbell fresh see significant accounting estimates for additional information in 2019 we recorded noncash impairment charges of 360 million 275 million after tax or 91 per share in 2018 the total noncash impairment charges were 694 million 571 million after tax or 189 per share in 2019 we incurred pretax expenses of 32 million associated with the sale process of the businesses including transaction costs in addition we recorded tax expense of 29 million in the third quarter as deferred tax assets associated with bolthouse farms were not realizable in 2018 loss from operations included a benefit from the favorable resolution of a tax matter 

liquidity and capital resources 

we expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations longterm borrowings shortterm borrowings which may include commercial paper credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents we believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements 

we generated cash flows from operations of 1396 million in 2020 compared to 1398 million in 2019 the decline in 2020 was primarily due to changes in working capital mostly offset by higher cash earnings and lower other cash payments 

we generated cash flows from operations of 1398 million in 2019 compared to 1305 million in 2018 the increase in 2019 was primarily due to improvements in working capital management efforts and higher cash earnings 

current assets are less than current liabilities as a result of our level of current maturities of longterm debt and shortterm borrowings and our focus to lower core working capital requirements we had negative working capital of 690 million as of 

august 2 2020 and 1418 million as of july 28 2019 total debt maturing within one year was 1202 million as of august 2 2020 and 1603 million as of july 28 2019 

capital expenditures were 299 million in 2020 384 million in 2019 and 407 million in 2018 capital expenditures in 2020 were lower than 2019 reflecting delays in certain projects impacted by the spread of the covid19 pandemic capital expenditures are expected to total approximately 350 million in 2021 capital expenditures in 2020 included the implementation of an sap enterpriseresource planning system for snyderslance a milano cookie capacity expansion project chip capacity expansion projects and a goldfish cracker capacity expansion project capital expenditures in 2019 included a us warehouse optimization project replacement of a pepperidge farm refrigeration system transition of production of the toronto manufacturing facility to our us thermal plants a snyderslance regional distribution center a milano cookie capacity expansion project and a goldfish cracker capacity expansion project capital expenditures in 2018 included a us warehouse optimization project transition of production of the toronto manufacturing facility to our us thermal plants insourcing manufacturing for certain simple meal products replacement of a pepperidge farm refrigeration system and an australian multipack biscuit capacity expansion project 

pepperidge farm and snyder’slance have a directstoredelivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors in order to maintain and expand this model we routinely purchase and sell routes the purchase and sale proceeds of the routes are reflected in investing activities 

primarily in response to the impact of the covid19 outbreak and the ensuing uncertainty surrounding the operating environment and the commercial paper market as well as favorable credit markets at the time on april 24 2020 we issued senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of 1000 million consisting of 500 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 2375 per annum due april 24 2030 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 3125 per annum due april 24 2050 on may 1 2020 we used 300 million of the net proceeds to repay 300 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and we intend to use the remaining net proceeds to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper as it comes due and for general corporate purposes thereby lessening our reliance on commercial paper the 2375 senior notes due 2030 and the 3125 senior notes due 2050 may each be redeemed at the applicable redemption price in whole or in part at our option at any time and from time to time prior to january 24 2030 and october 24 2049 respectively interest on each of the notes is due semiannually on april 24 and october 24 commencing on october 24 2020 the notes contain customary covenants and events of default if a change of control triggering event occurs we will be required to offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the purchase date

inflation 

we are exposed to the impact of inflation on our cost of products sold we use a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation including increasing prices commodity hedging and pursuing cost productivity initiatives 

market risk sensitivity 

the principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices in addition we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variablerate and fixedrate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variabletototal debt ratio within targeted guidelines net sales of continuing operations outside of the us are concentrated principally in canada and represent approximately 6 of 2020 net sales within discontinued operations international sales were concentrated principally in australia we manage our foreign currency exposures by utilizing foreign exchange forward contracts and borrowing in various foreign currencies we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments 

we principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short and longterm supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials including certain commodities and agricultural products we also enter into commodity futures options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of wheat soybean oil diesel fuel natural gas cocoa aluminum soybean meal and corn 

the information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of august 2 2020 fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 14 15 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements

as of july 28 2019 fixedrate debt of approximately 6260 million with an average interest rate of 399 and variablerate debt of approximately 2484 million with an average interest rate of 299 were outstanding 

we are exposed to foreign exchange risk related to thirdparty transactions and intercompany transactions including intercompany debt we utilize foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures the following table summarizes the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related weightedaverage contract exchange rates as of august 2 2020 



the aggregate fair value of all contracts was a loss of 1 million as of august 2 2020 as of july 28 2019 the total notional value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding was 323 million including 83 million associated with discontinued operations and the aggregate fair value was a loss of 3 million 

we enter into commodity futures options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities as of august 2 2020 the notional value of these contracts was  137 million and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of 2 million as of july 28 2019 the notional value of these contracts was  183 million and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of 3 million 

we enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of our capital stock the total return of the vanguard institutional index institutional plus shares and the total return of the vanguard total international stock index under these contracts we pay variable interest rates and receive from the counterparty either the total return on our capital stock the total return of the standard  poors 500 index which is expected to approximate the total return of the vanguard institutional index institutional plus shares or the total return of the ishares msci eafe index which is expected to approximate the total return of the vanguard total international stock index the notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return on our capital stock was 6 million at august 2 2020 and 7 million at july 28 2019 the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract which expires in june 2021 was 093 at august 2 2020 the notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the standard  poors 500 index was 13 million at august 2 2020 and 17 million at july 28 2019 the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract which expires in march 2021 was 053 at august 2 2020 the notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return of the ishares msci eafe index was 3 million at august 2 2020 and 7 million at july 28 2019 the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract which expires in march 2021 was 063 at august 2 2020 the fair value of these contracts was a gain of 4 million as of august 2 2020 and a gain of 1 million as of july 28 2019 

our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations debt repayment and debt issuances market effects on debt and foreign currency and our acquisition and divestiture activities 

significant accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions 

trade and consumer promotion programs — we offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers such as feature price discounts instore display incentives cooperative advertising programs new product introduction fees and coupons the mix between these forms of variable consideration which are classified as reductions in revenue and recognized upon sale and advertising or other marketing activities which are classified as marketing and selling expenses fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans the measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors including expected volume typically programs that are offered have a very short duration historically the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements differences between estimates and actual costs are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period however actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates we adopted revised guidance on the recognition of revenue in the first quarter of 2019 see notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

valuation of longlived assets — fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow 

analyses are used to determine if impairment exists if impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value 

goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill we may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a quantitative impairment test fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average costs of capital and future economic and market conditions if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the reporting unit to fair value 

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates weighted average costs of capital and assumed royalty rates if the carrying value exceeds fair value an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the asset to fair value 

2018 assessments 

discontinued operations 

during the second quarter of 2018 we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit as operating performance was below expectations the business was impacted by adverse weather conditions and the implementation of enhanced quality protocols which impacted crop yields and resulted in higher costs this cost volatility continued to be higher than expected and caused us to reassess our short and longterm margin expectations for this business based on this performance we reduced our outlook for future operating margins and discounted cash flows which resulted in a 75 million impairment charge representing a writedown of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit the fair value of the trademark exceeded the carrying value which was 48 million 

during the third quarter of 2018 we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the deli reporting unit which includes garden fresh gourmet and the us refrigerated soup business during the third quarter of 2018 certain of our private label refrigerated soup customers which represented a majority of the business informed us of their intention to insource production beginning in 2019 and the sales and operating profit outlook of the garden fresh gourmet business was reduced due to the anticipated loss of refrigerated soup business with these customers as well as the performance of the garden fresh gourmet business we revised the longterm outlook for future sales operating margins and discounted cash flows for this reporting unit which resulted in an 81 million impairment charge on goodwill representing a writedown of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit 13 million on a trademark and 11 million on plant assets in the reporting unit 

in addition we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit as the operating performance in the third quarter was below expectations we assessed sales performance of refrigerated beverages and key drivers impacting gross profit for the unit we revised our longterm outlook for future earnings and discounted cash flows to reflect reduced sales expectations to modest growth and decreased our gross profit outlook to reflect the inflation and manufacturing efficiency pressures that remained with the unit this revised outlook resulted in a 384 million impairment charge on goodwill representing a writedown of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit and 130 million on a trademark in the reporting unit 

continuing operations 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 as part of our annual review of intangible assets we recognized an impairment charge of 54 million on the plum trademark in 2018 sales and operating performance were well below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins in the fourth quarter of 2018 as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team and based on recent performance we lowered our longterm outlook for future sales 

2019 assessments 

discontinued operations 

on august 30 2018 we announced plans to pursue the divestiture of our international biscuits and snacks operating segment and the campbell fresh operating segment as we continued to pursue the divestiture of these businesses and as we received initial indications of value in the second quarter of 2019 we performed interim impairment assessments on the intangible and tangible assets within campbell fresh which included garden fresh gourmet bolthouse farms carrot and 

carrot ingredients and bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings as a result we revised our future outlook for earnings and cash flows for each of these businesses 

within bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients we recorded impairment charges of 18 million on the trademark and 159 million on the plant assets and amortizable intangible assets within bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings we recorded impairment charges of 74 million on the trademark and 31 million on the plant assets and amortizable intangible assets on garden fresh gourmet we recorded impairment charges of 23 million on the trademark and 39 million on customer relationships which eliminated the carrying value of these assets and 2 million on plant assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 as part of our annual review of intangible assets we recognized an impairment charge of 7 million on a trademark and 10 million on goodwill in kelsen due to a lower longterm outlook for sales and the pending sale of the business on july 12 2019 we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our kelsen business we sold the business on september 23 2019 

see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on discontinued operations 

continuing operations 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 we performed an assessment on the assets within our european chips business and recorded an impairment charge of 16 million on intangible assets this business was included in the snacks segment and reporting unit 

2020 assessments 

continuing operations 

as of august 2 2020 the carrying value of goodwill was 3986 million based on our assessments all of our reporting units had an excess fair value well over the carrying value 

as of august 2 2020 the carrying value of indefinitelived trademarks was 2611 million including 1978 million associated with snyderslance of the carrying value of all indefinitelived trademarks 620 million related to the snyder’s of hanover trademark 292 million related to the pace trademark 280 million related to the pacific foods trademark and 61 million related to the plum trademark holding all other assumptions constant changes in the assumptions below would reduce fair value of these trademarks and result in impairment charges of approximately 



the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance economic conditions market conditions and cost of capital inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control such as changes in capital markets the actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions 

if assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline potential additional impairment charges could result we will continue to monitor the valuation of our longlived assets 

see also note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets 

pension and postretirement benefits — we provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care trend rates independent actuaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states perform the required calculations to determine expense 

the discount rate is established as of our fiscal yearend measurement date in establishing the discount rate we review published market indices of highquality debt securities adjusted as appropriate for duration in addition independent actuaries apply highquality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans beginning in 2018 we changed the method we used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense income we elected to use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation of the relevant projected cash flows previously we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period we made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates this change does not affect the measurement of our benefit obligations we accounted for this change prospectively in 2018 as a change in 

accounting estimate  as a result of this change net periodic benefit income increased by approximately 17 million in 2018 compared to what the net periodic benefit income would have been under the previous method 

the expected return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering our current and projected investment mix this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation longterm projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date 

net periodic pension and postretirement expense income was 93 million in 2020 103 million in 2019 and 185 million in 2018 

significant weightedaverage assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows 



estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows a 50basispoint decline in the discount rate would decrease expense by approximately 9 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of approximately 120 million a 50basispoint reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 10 million a onepercentagepoint increase in assumed health care costs would have no impact on postretirement service and interest cost and would not result in an immediate loss 

contributions to pension plans were 2 million in 2020 and 5 million in 2019 and 2018 contributions to pension plans are not expected to be material in 2021 

see also note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement benefits 

income taxes — the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 

on december 22 2017 the act was enacted into law and made significant changes to corporate taxation including reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 and transitioning to a territorial system for taxation on foreign earnings along with the imposition of a transition tax in 2018 on the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings

ingredients and packaging 

the ingredients and packaging materials required for the manufacture of our food and beverage products are purchased from various suppliers these items are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including changes in crop size cattle cycles crop disease crop pests product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations governmentsponsored agricultural programs and other government policy import and export requirements including tariffs drought and excessive rain temperature extremes and other adverse weather events water scarcity scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients and other factors that may be beyond our control during the growing and harvesting seasons to help reduce some of this price volatility we use a combination of purchase orders short and longterm contracts inventory management practices and various commodity risk management tools for most of our ingredients and packaging ingredient inventories are generally at a peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only during certain seasons we make commitments for the purchase of such ingredients in their respective seasons in addition certain of the materials required for the manufacture of our products including steel have been or may be impacted by tariffs at this time we do not anticipate any material restrictions on the availability of ingredients or packaging that would have a significant impact on our businesses for information on the impact of inflation see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

customers 

in most of our markets sales and merchandising activities are conducted through our own sales force andor thirdparty brokers and distribution partners in the us canada and latin america our products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains mass discounters mass merchandisers club stores convenience stores drug stores dollar stores ecommerce and other retail commercial and noncommercial establishments each of pepperidge farm and snyderslance also has a directstoredelivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors we make shipments promptly after acceptance of orders 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 43  of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2019 46  in 2018 and 47  in 2017 our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 20  of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2019 22  in 2018 and 24  2017 the kroger co and its affiliates accounted for approximately 9 of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2019 and 10  in 2018 and 2017 both of our reportable segments sold products to walmart stores inc or its affiliates and the kroger co or its affiliates no other customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories this competition arises from numerous competitors of varying sizes across multiple food and beverage categories and includes producers of private label products as well as other branded food and beverage manufacturers private label products are generally sold at lower prices than branded products competitors market and sell their products through traditional retailers and ecommerce all of these competitors vie for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars the number of competitors cannot be reliably estimated our principal areas of competition are brand recognition taste nutritional value price promotion innovation shelf space and customer service 

working capital 

for information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital items see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

capital expenditures 

during 2019 our aggregate capital expenditures were 384 million  we expect to spend approximately 350 million for capital projects in 2020 which includes capital projects for campbell international for the anticipated period of ownership major capital projects based on planned spend in 2020 include implementation of an sap enterpriseresource planning system for snyderslance and a new manufacturing line for our snacks business 

regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated in the us our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies including the food and drug administration department of agriculture federal trade commission department of labor department of commerce and environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the us in addition the current us administration has implemented and is considering tariffs on certain imported commodities including steel in response other countries have adopted andor are considering countervailing tariffs on imported food and agriculture products 

environmental matters 

we have requirements for the operation and design of our facilities that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations of our 384 million  in capital expenditures made during 2019 approximately 29 million were for compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the us we further estimate that approximately 13 million of the capital expenditures anticipated during 2020 will be for compliance with us environmental laws and regulations we believe that continued compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations both within the us and elsewhere will not have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position in addition we continue to monitor existing and pending environmental laws and regulations within the us and elsewhere relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions while the impact of these laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

seasonality 

demand for soup products is seasonal with the fall and winter months usually accounting for the highest sales volume demand for our other products is generally evenly distributed throughout the year

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

operational risk factors 

we face significant competition in all our product categories which may result in lower sales and margins 

we operate in the highly competitive food and beverage industry mainly in the north american market and experience competition in all of our categories the principal areas of competition are brand recognition taste nutritional value price promotion innovation shelf space and customer service a number of our primary competitors are larger than us and have substantial financial marketing and other resources and some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do in addition reduced barriers to entry and easier access to funding are creating new competition a strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts or a continued shift towards private label offerings could result in us reducing prices increasing marketing or other expenditures andor losing market share each of which may result in lower sales and margins 

our ability to compete also depends upon our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences there are inherent marketplace risks associated with new product or packaging introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance if we do not succeed in offering products that consumers want to buy our sales and market share will decrease resulting in reduced profitability if we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longlasting or are unable to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales will decline in addition given the variety of backgrounds and identities of consumers in our consumer base we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences as such we must be successful in developing innovative products across a multitude of product categories finally if we fail to rapidly develop products in fastergrowing and more profitable categories we could experience reduced demand for our products or fail to expand margins 

our results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of divestitures 

during the first half of 2020 we expect to complete the sale of our arnott’s and international operations and use the net proceeds from this divestiture to reduce debt our ability to successfully divest this business depends upon among other things receiving all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected in addition any other businesses we decide to divest may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected potential risks of divestitures may also include diversion of managements attention from other business concerns loss of key suppliers andor customers of divested businesses the inability to separate divested businesses or business units effectively and efficiently from our existing business operations and the inability to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs if we are unable to complete or realize the projected benefits of planned andor future divestitures we may not be able to reduce our debt as planned and our business or financial results may be adversely impacted 

we may be adversely impacted by our substantial indebtedness 

we used the net proceeds from the businesses we sold in 2019 to reduce our debt and expect to use the net proceeds from the sale of campbell international to further reduce debt however as of july 28 2019 we maintained approximately 87 billion  of indebtedness and this level of indebtedness may have important consequences to our business including but not limited to 

 in addition we regularly access the commercial paper markets for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes if our credit ratings are downgraded we may have difficulty selling additional debt securities or borrowing money in the amounts and on the terms that might be available if our credit ratings were maintained see managements discussion and analysis of 

6   

financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources for additional information regarding our indebtedness 

disruptions in the commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit markets may also reduce the amount of commercial paper that we can issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short and longterm debt offerings there can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms we find acceptable limitations on our ability to access the capital markets a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we may not achieve our targeted cost savings which may adversely affect our ability to grow margins 

we are pursuing multiyear cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of 850 million for continuing operations by the end of 2022 which includes 295 million in synergies and runrate cost savings from our acquisition of snyderslance these initiatives require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of these initiatives including the integration of snyderslance in an efficient and effective manner in some respects our plans to achieve these cost savings continue to be refined see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives for additional information on these initiatives these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from other business issues have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from these often complex initiatives any failure to implement our initiatives could adversely affect our ability to grow margins 

we may not be able to increase prices to fully offset increases in the cost of transportation and logistics and prices of raw and   packaging materials 

the cost of distribution has increased recently due to a rise in transportation and logistics costs driven by excess demand reduced availability and higher fuel costs in addition certain of the materials required for the manufacture of our products including steel have been or may be impacted by tariffs 

as a manufacturer of food and beverage products the raw and packaging materials used in our business include tomato paste grains beef poultry dairy potatoes and other vegetables steel glass paper and resin many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including but not limited to changes in crop size cattle cycles crop disease crop pests product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations governmentsponsored agricultural programs and other government policy import and export requirements including tariffs drought and excessive rain temperature extremes and other adverse weather events water scarcity scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients and other factors that may be beyond our control we may not be able to offset any price increases through productivity or price increases or through our commodity hedging activity 

we try to pass along to customers some or all cost increases through increases in the selling prices of or decreases in the packaging sizes of some of our products higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume to the extent that price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs andor if they result in significant decreases in sales volume our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customers 

our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade which has experienced slower growth than other retail channels such as dollar stores drug stores club stores and ecommerce retailers we expect this trend away from traditional retail grocery to alternate channels to continue in the future these alternative retail channels may also create consumer price deflation affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases in addition retailers with increased buying power and negotiating strength are seeking more favorable terms including increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers these customers may also use more of their shelf space for their private label products which are generally sold at lower prices than branded products if we are unable to use our scale marketing product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics our business or financial results could be adversely impacted 

in 2019 our five largest customers accounted for approximately 43  of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations with the largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounting for approximately 20  of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in addition the kroger co and its affiliates accounted for approximately 9 of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2019 there can be no assurance that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past disruption of sales to any of these customers or to any of our other large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results 

7   

our results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is primarily based on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products packaging or ingredients whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our results could be adversely impacted 

disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to manufacture andor sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing warehousing or distribution capabilities or to the capabilities of our suppliers contract manufacturers logistics service providers or independent distributors this damage or disruption could result from execution issues as well as factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as product or raw material scarcity adverse weather conditions natural disasters fire terrorism pandemics strikes cybersecurity breaches government shutdowns disruptions in logistics supplier capacity constraints or other events production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought and excessive rain temperature extremes and other adverse weather events water scarcity scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients crop size cattle cycles crop disease and crop pests failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur may adversely affect our business or financial results particularly in circumstances when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location disputes with significant suppliers contract manufacturers logistics service providers or independent distributors including disputes regarding pricing or performance may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture andor sell our products as well as our business or financial results 

if our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled we might need to recall those items and we may experience product liability claims and damage to our reputation 

we have in the past and we may in the future need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes sickness or injury to consumers a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment a significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety andor quality of our products ingredients or packaging in addition if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in that category 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could adversely affect our financial results and net worth   

as of july 28 2019  we had goodwill of 4678 billion  and other indefinitelived intangible assets of 2753 billion  of which a total of 785 million  relates to campbell international and has been included in noncurrent assets of discontinued operations goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise we test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including goodwill to the units fair value similarly we test indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values fair value for both goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis if the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets exceed their fair value the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair value factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates we have in the most recently completed and prior years experienced impairment charges see significant accounting estimates and notes 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on recent impairments we may be required in the future to record additional impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets which could adversely affect our financial results and net worth 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly our trademarks to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark patent copyright and trade secret protection contractual agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect 

8   

our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results 

competing intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and timeconsuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development launch and sale of certain products any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results 

we may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to   our defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in the us and certain nonus locations the major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets investment returns interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we may be adversely impacted by a failure or security breach of our information technology systems 

our information technology systems are critically important to our operations we rely on our information technology systems some of which are outsourced to third parties to manage our data communications and business processes including our marketing sales manufacturing procurement logistics customer service accounting and administrative functions if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect appropriate information technology systems our business or financial results could be adversely impacted furthermore our information technology systems may be vulnerable to attack or other security breaches including the access to or acquisition of customer consumer or other confidential information service disruptions or other system failures if we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve these breaches disruptions or failures our operations may be impacted and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as reputational damage litigation remediation costs andor penalties under various data protection laws and regulations 

to address the risks to our information technology systems and the associated costs we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology and security policies cyber insurance employee training and monitoring and routine testing of our information technology systems we believe that these preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks although we have not experienced a material incident to date there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident the cost to remediate damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber attack could be significant 

in addition in the event our suppliers or customers experience a breach or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in our supply chain or reduced customer orders which would adversely affect our business and financial results we have also outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if these service providers do not perform effectively due to breach or system failure we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and our business may be disrupted 

we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business 

we depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we also compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results in addition activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results we also recently streamlined our business into a twodivision operating model which could lead to operational challenges and higher employee turnover 

our results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of acquisitions and other strategic transactions 

we may undertake additional acquisitions or other strategic transactions our ability to meet our objectives with respect to acquisitions and other strategic transactions may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable counterparties negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected and complete those transactions potential risks also include 



9   

 market conditions and other general risk factors 

actions of activist shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs divert managements attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our business   

we were the target of activist shareholder activities in 2019 if these activities continue our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and timeconsuming disruptive to our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees in addition perceived uncertainties as to our future direction strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist shareholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities harm our ability to attract new investors customers employees suppliers and other strategic partners and cause our share price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation 

we face risks related to recession financial and credit market disruptions   and other economic conditions 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions recession equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the us or other nations similarly disruptions in financial andor credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors in addition changes in tax or interest rates in the us or other nations whether due to recession economic disruptions or other reasons may adversely impact us 

the administering regulatory authority announced it intends to phase out london interbank offered rate libor by the end of 2021 our variable rate debt and revolving credit facility use libor as a benchmark for establishing interest rates while we expect to have paid off our variablerate debt and replaced or renegotiated our revolving credit facility by the end of 2021 we plan to incur additional indebtedness andor negotiate new terms that will rely on an alternative method to libor any legal or regulatory changes made in response to libor’s future discontinuance may result in among other things a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in libor a delay in the publication of libor or changes in the rules or methodologies in libor in addition alternative methods to libor may be impossible or impracticable to determine while we do not expect that the transition from libor and risks related thereto will have a material adverse effect on our financing costs it is still uncertain at this time 

legal and regulatory risk factors 

we may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings or claims

within our international biscuits and snacks operating segment we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our kelsen business on july 12 2019 and completed the sale on september 23 2019 for approximately 300 million subject to customary purchase price adjustments we also signed a definitive agreement on august 1 2019 for the sale of our arnott’s business and certain other international operations including the simple meals and shelfstable beverages businesses in australia and asia pacific the arnotts and international operations for 22 billion subject to customary purchase price adjustments we expect to complete the sale in the first half of 2020 beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019 we have reflected the results of operations of the kelsen business and the arnott’s and international operations collectively referred to as campbell international as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of these businesses have been reflected in assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets as of july 28 2019 and july 29 2018 these businesses were historically included in the global biscuits and snacks reportable segment see notes 3 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these recently completed and pending divestitures and reportable segments 

in addition on september 18 2019 we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our european chips business for £66 million or approximately 80 million the sale is subject to customary closing conditions including receiving the relevant regulatory approvals and we expect to complete the sale in the first quarter of 2020 

we used the net proceeds from the businesses we sold in 2019 to reduce our debt and expect to use the net proceeds from the businesses sold in 2020 to further reduce debt 

our simple meals and shelfstable beverages business in latin america was managed as part of the snacks segment in 2018 and the meals  beverages segment in 2019 segment results have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation in 2020 our latin america business is managed as part of the snacks segment see business  reportable segments for a description of the products included in each segment 

strategy 

our strategy is to deliver longterm sustainable growth by focusing on our core brands in two divisions within north america while delivering on the promise of our purpose  real food that matters for life’s moments  

we plan to revise our consumer and customer engagement models through the development of more defined consumeroriented portfolio roles for our products and increase prioritizing of retailers which we believe will create a more profitable growth model in addition we expect to increase focus on the growth of our snacks business we also intend to dedicate additional investment in us soup and support our core brands through a revised marketing and innovation model tailored to specific categories and targeted customers and consumers 

we will continue pursuing our multiyear cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of 850 million for continuing operations by the end of 2022  which includes 295 million in synergies and runrate cost savings from our acquisition of snyderslance inc snyderslance we expect to achieve these additional savings with continued network optimization

organization consolidation and integration procurement savings and incremental savings opportunities across several cost categories see restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives for additional information on these initiatives 

in addition we will pursue a more focused and diverse organization that supports our core brands in north america in the fourth quarter of 2019 we made an organizational change that streamlined our business into a twodivision operating model with differentiated resources and capabilities that we believe will best support the brands within each division 

business trends 

our businesses are being influenced by a variety of trends that we anticipate will continue in the future including changing consumer preferences a competitive and dynamic retail environment and cost inflation 

our strategy is designed in part to capture growing consumer preferences for snacking and convenience for example consumers are changing their eating habits by increasing the type and frequency of snacks they consume we also expect consumers to continue to seek products that they associate with health and wellbeing including naturally functional and organic foods 

retailers continue to use their buying power and negotiating strength to seek increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms we expect consolidations among retailers will continue to create large and sophisticated customers that may further this trend retailers also continue to grow and promote store brands that compete with branded products while other challenger brands drive innovation and engagement that threatens our market share in addition our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade which has experienced slower growth than other retail channels such as dollar stores drug stores club stores and ecommerce retailers we anticipate that alternative retail channels particularly ecommerce will continue to grow rapidly 

the cost of distribution has increased due to a rise in transportation and logistics costs driven by excess demand reduced availability and higher fuel costs in addition certain ingredients and packaging required for the manufacture of our products including steel have been or may be impacted by tariffs and weatherrelated events we expect these cost pressures to continue in 2020

operating earnings 

segment operating earnings increased 3  in 2019  from 2018  and decreased 4  in 2018  from 2017  

an analysis of operating earnings by segment follows 



 

 operating earnings from meals  beverages decreased   9  in 2019  versus 2018  the decrease was primarily due to higher levels of cost inflation and higher warehousing and transportation costs as well as higher promotional spending and higher incentive compensation expenses partly offset by supply chain productivity improvements lower marketing and selling expenses and the benefits of cost savings initiatives 

operating earnings from meals  beverages decreased   12  in 2018  versus 2017  the decrease was primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage and lower sales volume partly offset by lower marketing and selling expenses gross profit performance was impacted by cost inflation including higher transportation and logistics costs and the dilutive impact from the acquisition of pacific foods

interest expense 

interest expense increased  to 356 million  in 2019  from 183 million  in 2018  the increase in interest expense was due to higher levels of debt associated with funding the acquisitions higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio and a gain of 18 million on treasury rate lock contracts in the prior year used to hedge the planned financing of the snyderslance acquisition 

interest expense increased  to 183 million  in 2018  from 115 million  in 2017  the increase in interest expense was due to higher levels of debt associated with funding the acquisitions and higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio partially offset by a gain of 18 million on treasury rate lock contracts used to hedge the planned financing of the snyderslance acquisition

restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives 

2015 initiatives and snyderslance cost transformation program and integration 

in fiscal 2015 we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure as part of these initiatives we commenced a voluntary employee separation program available to certain usbased salaried employees nearing retirement who met age lengthofservice and business unitfunction criteria 

in february 2017 we announced that we were expanding these initiatives by further optimizing our supply chain network primarily in north america continuing to evolve our operating model to drive efficiencies and more fully integrating our recent acquisitions in january 2018 as part of the expanded initiatives we authorized additional pretax costs to improve the operational efficiency of our thermal supply chain network in north america by closing our manufacturing facility in toronto ontario and to optimize our information technology infrastructure by migrating certain applications to the latest cloud technology platform in august 2018 we announced that we will continue to streamline our organization expand our zerobased budgeting efforts and optimize our manufacturing network 

on march 26 2018 we completed the acquisition of snyderslance prior to the acquisition in april 2017 snyderslance launched a cost transformation program following a comprehensive review of its operations with the goal of significantly improving its financial performance we expect to continue to implement this program and to achieve a majority of the programs targeted savings in addition we have identified opportunities for additional cost synergies as we integrate snyderslance 

cost estimates as well as timing for certain activities are continuing to be developed 

a summary of pretax charges recorded in earnings from continuing operations related to both programs is as follows 



 

26   

 a summary of the pretax charges recorded in earnings loss from discontinued operations is as follows 

 

1 includes 19 million  of severance pay and benefits and 4 million  of implementation costs and other related costs 

as of april 28 2019 we incurred substantially all of the costs for actions associated with discontinued operations all of the costs were cash expenditures 

a summary of the pretax costs in earnings from continuing operations associated with both programs is as follows 



 

 the total estimated pretax costs for actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified under both programs are approximately 615 million  to 665 million  this estimate will be updated as costs for the expanded initiatives are developed 

we expect the costs for actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified to date under both programs to consist of the following approximately 205 million  to 210 million  in severance pay and benefits approximately 65 million  in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation and approximately 345 million  to 390 million  in implementation costs and other related costs we expect these pretax costs to be associated with our segments as follows meals  beverages  approximately 35  snacks  approximately 40  and corporate  approximately 25  

of the aggregate 615 million  to 665 million  of pretax costs associated with continuing operations identified to date under both programs we expect approximately 540 million  to 590 million  will be cash expenditures in addition we expect to invest approximately 395 million in capital expenditures through 2021 of which we invested approximately 250 million  as of july 28 2019  the capital expenditures primarily relate to the us warehouse optimization project improvement of quality safety and cost structure across the snyder’slance manufacturing network implementation of an sap enterpriseresource planning system for snyderslance transition of production of the toronto manufacturing facility to our us thermal plants optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications insourcing of manufacturing for certain simple meal products and optimization of the snyder’slance warehouse and distribution network 

we expect to incur substantially all of the costs for the actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified to date through 2020 and to fund the costs through cash flows from operations and shortterm borrowings 

we expect the initiatives for actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified to date under both programs to generate pretax savings of 710 million in 2020 and once all phases are implemented to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately 850 million by the end of 2022 the annual pretax savings associated with continuing operations generated by both programs were as follows 



the initiatives for actions associated with discontinued operations generated pretax savings of over 90 million in 2019 and 60 million in 2018

on february 25 2019 we sold our us refrigerated soup business and on april 25 2019 we sold our garden fresh gourmet business proceeds were approximately 55 million  subject to customary purchase price adjustments on june 16 2019 we sold our bolthouse farms business proceeds were approximately 500 million  subject to customary purchase price adjustments beginning in the third quarter of 2019 we have reflected the results of these businesses as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented 

within our international biscuits and snacks operating segment we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our kelsen business on july 12 2019 and completed the sale on september 23 2019 for approximately 300 million  subject to customary purchase price adjustments we also signed a definitive agreement on august 1 2019 for the sale of the arnott’s and international operations for 22 billion  subject to customary purchase price adjustments we expect to complete the sale in the first half of 2020 beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019 we have reflected the results of operations of the kelsen business and the arnott’s and international operations or campbell international as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented these businesses were historically included in the global biscuits and snacks reportable segment 

results of discontinued operations were as follows 

in 2019  campbell fresh sales decreased primarily due to the sale of the businesses as well as declines in refrigerated soup bolthouse farms  refrigerated beverages and garden fresh gourmet 

in 2018  campbell fresh sales were comparable to the prior year as gains in carrot ingredients and garden fresh gourmet were offset by declines in bolthouse farms  refrigerated beverages  

28   

in 2019  2018  and 2017  we recorded impairment charges on the reporting units in campbell fresh see significant accounting estimates for additional information in 2019  we recorded noncash impairment charges of 360 million 275 million after tax or 91 per share in 2018  and 2017 the total noncash impairment charges were 694 million 571 million after tax or 189 per share and 212 million 180 million after tax or 59 per share respectively in 2019  we incurred pretax expenses of 32 million associated with the sale process of the businesses including transaction costs in addition we recorded tax expense of 29 million in the third quarter as deferred tax assets associated with bolthouse farms were not realizable in 2018 loss from operations included a benefit from the favorable resolution of a tax matter 

in 2019 campbell international sales decreased reflecting the negative impact of currency translation and declines in kelsen cookies in the us 

in 2018 campbell international sales increased due to the favorable impact from currency translation excluding the impact from currency translation sales decreased with declines in arnott’s biscuits in indonesia partly offset by gains in kelsen cookies in china 

in 2019  excluding items impacting comparability earnings from campbell international declined primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage reflecting higher supply chain costs and higher promotional spending as well as the negative impact of currency translation 

in 2018 earnings from campbell international declined primarily due to higher interest expense 

liquidity and capital resources 

we expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations longterm borrowings shortterm borrowings including commercial paper credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents we believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements 

in august 2018 we announced the results of our comprehensive board of directorsled strategy and portfolio review which included plans to pursue the divestiture of our international biscuits and snacks operating segment and our campbell fresh operating segment we sold campbell fresh in 2019 as further described below within our international biscuits and snacks operating segment we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our kelsen business on july 12 2019 and completed the sale on september 23 2019 for approximately 300 million  subject to customary purchase price adjustments we also signed a definitive agreement on august 1 2019 for the sale of the arnott’s and international operations for 22 billion  subject to customary purchase price adjustments and expect to complete the sale in the first half of 2020 in addition on september 18 2019 we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our european chips business for £66 million or approximately 80 million the sale is subject to customary closing conditions including receiving the relevant regulatory approvals and we expect to complete the sale in the first quarter of 2020 

we used the net proceeds from the businesses we sold in 2019 to reduce our debt and expect to use the net proceeds from the businesses sold in 2020 to further reduce debt 

in addition we plan to continue driving improved asset efficiency in working capital and capital expenditures to generate cash we expect to maintain disciplined cash flow and capital allocation priorities in 2020 including for capital investments our dividend and debt reduction 

we generated cash flows from operations of 1398 billion in 2019  compared to 1305 billion  in 2018  the increase  in 2019  was primarily due to improvements in working capital management efforts and higher cash earnings 

we generated cash flows from operations of 1305 billion in 2018  compared to 1288 billion  in 2017  the increase  in 2018  was primarily due to lower working capital requirements partially offset by lower cash earnings 

current assets are less than current liabilities as a result of our level of current maturities of longterm debt and shortterm borrowings and our focus to lower core working capital requirements while extending payment terms for accounts payables we had negative working capital of 1418 billion  as of july 28 2019  and 1298 billion  as of july 29 2018  total debt maturing within one year was 1603 billion as of july 28 2019  and 1896 billion as of july 29 2018  

capital expenditures were 384 million in 2019  407 million  in 2018  and 338 million  in 2017  capital expenditures are expected to total approximately 350 million  in 2020  capital expenditures in 2019  included a us warehouse optimization project replacement of a pepperidge farm refrigeration system transition of production of the toronto manufacturing facility to our us thermal plants a snyderslance regional distribution center a milano  cookie capacity expansion project and a goldfish cracker capacity expansion project capital expenditures in 2018  included a us warehouse optimization project transition of production of the toronto manufacturing facility to our us thermal plants insourcing manufacturing for certain simple meal products replacement of a pepperidge farm refrigeration system and an australian multipack biscuit capacity expansion project capital expenditures in 2017  included projects to expand australian multipack biscuit capacity beverage and salad dressing capacity at bolthouse farms and capacity at garden fresh as well as the continued enhancement of our corporate headquarters replacement of a pepperidge farm refrigeration system and a us warehouse optimization project 

29   

pepperidge farm and snyder’slance have a directstoredelivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors in order to maintain and expand this model we routinely purchase and sell routes the purchase and sale proceeds of the routes are reflected in investing activities

inflation 

we are exposed to the impact of inflation on our cost of products sold we use a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation including increasing prices commodity hedging and pursuing cost productivity initiatives 

market risk sensitivity 

the principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices in addition we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variablerate and fixedrate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variabletototal debt ratio within targeted guidelines net sales of continuing operations outside of the us are concentrated principally in canada and represent approximately 8  of 2019 net sales within discontinued operations international sales are concentrated principally in australia we manage our foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing crosscurrency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts we enter into crosscurrency swaps 

31   

and foreign exchange forward contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments 

we principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short and longterm supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials including certain commodities and agricultural products we also enter into commodity futures options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of soybean oil wheat diesel fuel aluminum natural gas soybean meal corn cocoa butter and cheese which impact the cost of raw materials 

the information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of july 28 2019  fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 13 14 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

the following table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for debt obligations interest rates disclosed on variablerate debt represent the weightedaverage rates at july 28 2019  



 

 as of july 29 2018  fixedrate debt of approximately 6906 billion with an average interest rate of 410 and variablerate debt of approximately 3052 billion with an average interest rate of 286 were outstanding 

we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries including subsidiary debt we utilize foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures the following table summarizes the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related weightedaverage contract exchange rates as of july 28 2019

32   

we enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of our capital stock the total return of the vanguard institutional index institutional plus shares and the total return of the vanguard total international stock index under these contracts we pay variable interest rates and receive from the counterparty either the total return on our capital stock the total return of the standard  poors 500 index which is expected to approximate the total return of the vanguard institutional index institutional plus shares or the total return of the ishares msci eafe index which is expected to approximate the total return of the vanguard total international stock index the notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return on our capital stock was 7 million  at july 28 2019  and 8 million  at july 29 2018  the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract which expires in april 2020  was 184  at july 28 2019  the notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the standard  poors 500 index was 17 million  at july 28 2019  and 23 million  at july 29 2018  the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract which expires in march 2020  was 147  at july 28 2019  the notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return of the ishares msci eafe index was 7 million  at july 28 2019  and 10 million  at july 29 2018  the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract which expires in march 2020  was 144  at july 28 2019  as of july 28 2019  and july 29 2018  the fair value of these contracts was a gain of 1 million 

our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations debt repayment and debt issuances market effects on debt and foreign currency and our acquisition and divestiture activities 

significant accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions 

trade and consumer promotion programs — we offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers such as feature price discounts instore display incentives cooperative advertising programs new product introduction fees and coupons the mix between these forms of variable consideration which are classified as reductions in revenue and recognized upon sale and advertising or other marketing activities which are classified as marketing and selling expenses fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues the measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors including expected volume typically programs that are offered have a very short duration historically the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements differences between estimates and actual costs are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period however actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates we adopted revised guidance on the recognition of revenue in the first quarter of 2019 see notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

valuation of longlived assets — fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if impairment exists if impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value 

goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill we may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a quantitative impairment test fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average costs of capital and future economic and market conditions if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value goodwill is considered impaired in january 2017 the fasb issued revised guidance that simplifies the test for goodwill impairment effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 with early adoption permitted we elected to early adopt the guidance in the fourth quarter of 2017 under the revised guidance if a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the reporting unit to fair value prior to the revised guidance the amount of the impairment was the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value which was calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination 

33   

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates weighted average costs of capital and assumed royalty rates if the carrying value exceeds fair value an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the asset to fair value 

2017 assessments 

discontinued operations 

during the second quarter of 2017 sales and operating profit performance for bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients were well below our expectations due to difficulty with regaining market share lost during 2016 and higher carrot costs from the adverse impact of heavy rains on crop yields during the quarter we also lowered our forecast for sales and earnings for the reporting unit for the second half of 2017 based on revised market share recovery expectations and the continuing effect of unusual weather conditions on carrot costs in addition as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team of campbell fresh during the second quarter we decided to reduce emphasis on growing sales of carrot ingredients which are a byproduct of the manufacturing process and to manage carrots sold at retail for modest sales growth consistent with the category while improving profitability accordingly we reduced our expectations for recovery of retail carrot market share as a consequence of the business performance and the strategic review we lowered our sales outlook for future fiscal yearswe also lowered our average margin expectations due in part to cost volatility which has been higher than expected based upon the business performance in the second quarter of 2017 our reduced nearterm outlook and reduced expectations for sales operating margins and discounted cash flows we performed an interim impairment assessment in the second quarter which resulted in a 127 million impairment charge on goodwill and 20 million on a trademark in the reporting unit 

we acquired garden fresh gourmet on june 29 2015 during 2017 sales and operating profit performance for garden fresh gourmet a reporting unit within the campbell fresh segment were well below expectations and we lowered our outlook for the second half of 2017 due to customer losses and failure to meet product distribution goals we expected to expand distribution of salsa beyond our concentration in the midwest region however this proved to be challenging as differentiated recipes are required to meet taste profiles in other parts of the country in addition as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team of campbell fresh during the second quarter we lowered our distribution and category growth expectations and therefore future sales outlook based upon the business performance in 2017 our reduced nearterm outlook and reduced expectations for sales operating margins and discounted cash flows we performed an interim impairment assessment in the second quarter which resulted in a 64 million impairment charge on goodwill and 1 million on a trademark in the reporting unit 

2018 assessments 

discontinued operations 

during the second quarter of 2018 we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit as operating performance was below expectations the business was impacted by adverse weather conditions and the implementation of enhanced quality protocols which impacted crop yields and resulted in higher costs this cost volatility continued to be higher than expected and caused us to reassess our short and longterm margin expectations for this business based on this performance we reduced our outlook for future operating margins and discounted cash flows which resulted in a 75 million impairment charge representing a writedown of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit the fair value of the trademark exceeded the carrying value which was 48 million  

during the third quarter of 2018 we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the deli reporting unit which includes garden fresh gourmet and the us refrigerated soup business within campbell fresh during the third quarter of 2018 certain of our private label refrigerated soup customers which represent a majority of the business informed us of their intention to insource production beginning in 2019 and the sales and operating profit outlook of the garden fresh gourmet business was reduced due to the anticipated loss of refrigerated soup business with these customers as well as the recent performance of the garden fresh gourmet business we revised the longterm outlook for future sales operating margins and discounted cash flows for this reporting unit which resulted in an 81 million impairment charge on goodwill representing a writedown of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit 13 million on a trademark and 11 million on plant assets in the reporting unit 

in addition we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit within the campbell fresh segment as the operating performance in the third quarter was below expectations we assessed sales performance of refrigerated beverages and key drivers impacting gross profit for the unit we revised our longterm outlook for future earnings and discounted cash flows to reflect reduced sales expectations to modest growth and decreased our gross profit outlook to reflect the inflation and manufacturing efficiency pressures that remain with the unit this revised outlook resulted in a 384 million  impairment charge on goodwill representing a writedown of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit and 130 million  on a trademark in the reporting unit 

34   

continuing operations 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 as part of our annual review of intangible assets we recognized an impairment charge of 54 million  on the plum  trademark in 2018 sales and operating performance were well below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins in the fourth quarter of 2018 as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team and based on recent performance we lowered our longterm outlook for future sales 

2019 assessments 

discontinued operations 

on august 30 2018 we announced plans to pursue the divestiture of our international biscuits and snacks operating segment and the campbell fresh operating segment as we continued to pursue the divestiture of these businesses and as we received initial indications of value in the second quarter of 2019 we performed interim impairment assessments on the intangible and tangible assets within campbell fresh which includes garden fresh gourmet bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients and bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings as a result we revised our future outlook for earnings and cash flows for each of these businesses 

within bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients we recorded impairment charges of 18 million  on the trademark and 159 million on the plant assets and amortizable intangible assetswithin bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings we recorded impairment charges of 74 million  on the trademark and 31 million on the plant assets and amortizable intangible assets on garden fresh gourmet we recorded impairment charges of 23 million  on the trademark and 39 million  on customer relationships which eliminated the carrying value of these assets and 2 million on plant assets there is no goodwill in campbell fresh 

on february 25 2019 we sold our us refrigerated soup business and on april 25 2019 we sold our garden fresh gourmet business on june 16 2019 we sold bolthouse farms 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 as part of our annual review of intangible assets we recognized an impairment charge of 7 million  on a trademark and 10 million  on goodwill in kelsen due to a lower longterm outlook for sales and the pending sale of the business on july 12 2019 we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our kelsen business we sold the business on september 23 2019 

as of july 28 2019 noncurrent assets of discontinued operations included 124 million  of trademarks and 661 million  of goodwill 

see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on discontinued operations 

continuing operations 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 we performed an assessment on the assets within our european chips business and recorded an impairment charge of 16 million  on intangible assets this business is included in the snacks segment and reporting unit as a result of signing a definitive agreement to sell the european chips business on september 18 2019 we expect to incur additional charges of approximately 65 million in the first quarter of 2020 as the carrying value of the disposal group will include allocated goodwill as well as foreign currency translation adjustments 

as of july 28 2019  the carrying value of goodwill related to continuing operations was 4017 billion  excluding potential charges related to the pending sale of the european chips business holding all other assumptions used in the 2019 fair value measurement constant a 1 increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital assumption would not reduce fair value of any of the reporting units below carrying value and would not result any impairment charges the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds net book value by at least 60 

as of july 28 2019  the carrying value of indefinitelived trademarks related to continuing operations was 2629 billion  of which 61 million related to the plum  trademark and 292 million related to the pace trademark holding all other assumptions used in the 2019 plum trademark fair value measurement constant neither a 1 increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital nor a 1 reduction in revenue growth would result in a fair value below carrying value the estimated fair value of the pace trademark exceeded the carrying value by less than 10 holding all other assumptions used in the 2019 pace trademark fair value measurement constant a 1 increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital would result in an impairment charge of approximately 20 million and a 1 reduction in revenue growth would result in a fair value equal to carrying value 

for our recent acquisitions the carrying value of trademarks of 280 million  associated with the pacific foods acquisition and 1996 billion  associated with the snyderslance acquisition approximates fair value as of july 28 2019 holding all other assumptions constant changes in the assumptions below would reduce fair value of the these trademarks and result in impairment charges of approximately 

35   



the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance economic conditions market conditions and cost of capital inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control such as changes in capital markets the actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions 

if assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline potential additional impairment charges could result we will continue to monitor the valuation of our longlived assets 

see also note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets 

pension and postretirement benefits — we provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care trend rates independent actuaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states perform the required calculations to determine expense 

the discount rate is established as of our fiscal yearend measurement date in establishing the discount rate we review published market indices of highquality debt securities adjusted as appropriate for duration in addition independent actuaries apply highquality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans beginning in 2018 we changed the method we used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense income we elected to use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation of the relevant projected cash flows previously we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period we made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates this change did not affect the measurement of our benefit obligations we accounted for this change prospectively in 2018 as a change in accounting estimate  as a result of this change net periodic benefit income increased by approximately 17 million  in 2018 compared to what the net periodic benefit income would have been under the previous method 

the expected return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering our current and projected investment mix this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation longterm projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date 

net periodic pension and postretirement expense income was 103 million  in 2019  185 million  in 2018  and 258 million  in 2017  

significant weightedaverage assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows 



estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows a 50basispoint decline in the discount rate would decrease expense by approximately 7 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of approximately 107 million a 50basispoint reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 10 million a onepercentagepoint increase in assumed health care costs would have no impact on postretirement service and interest cost and would not result in an immediate loss 

no contributions were made to us pension plans in 2019  2018  and 2017  contributions to nonus plans were 5 million  in 2019  2018  and 2017  we do not expect to contribute to the us pension plans in 2020 contributions to nonus plans are not expected to be material in 2020

income taxes — the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 

on december 22 2017 the act was enacted into law and made significant changes to corporate taxation including reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 and transitioning to a territorial system for taxation on foreign earnings along with the imposition of a transition tax in 2018 on the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings

see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding our reportable segments 

ingredients and packaging 

the ingredients and packaging materials required for the manufacture of our food and beverage products are purchased from various suppliers these items are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including changes in crop size cattle cycles crop disease crop pests product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations governmentsponsored agricultural programs import and export requirements including tariffs drought water scarcity temperature extremes scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients and other factors that may be beyond our control during the growing and harvesting seasons to help reduce some of this price volatility we use a combination of purchase orders short and longterm contracts inventory management practices and various commodity risk management tools for most of our ingredients and packaging ingredient inventories are generally at a peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only during certain seasons we make commitments for the purchase of such ingredients in their respective seasons in addition certain of the materials required for the manufacture of our products including steel have been or may be impacted by new or recently proposed tariffs at this time we do not anticipate any material restrictions on the availability of ingredients or packaging that would have a significant impact on our businesses for information on the impact of inflation see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

customers 

in most of our markets sales and merchandising activities are conducted through our own sales force andor thirdparty brokers and distribution partners in the us canada and latin america our products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains mass discounters mass merchandisers club stores convenience stores drug stores dollar stores ecommerce and other retail commercial and noncommercial establishments each of pepperidge farm and snyderslance also has a directstoredelivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors in the asia pacific region and europe our products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains convenience stores ecommerce and other retail commercial and noncommercial establishments we make shipments promptly after acceptance of orders

trademarks and technology 

as of september 17 2018 we owned over 4400 trademark registrations and applications in over 160 countries we believe our trademarks are of material importance to our business although the laws vary by jurisdiction trademarks generally are valid as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to have become generic trademark registrations generally can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use we believe that our principal brands including arnotts   bolthouse farms   campbells   cape cod  chunky  emerald  garden fresh gourmet   goldfish   kettle  kettle brand  kjeldsens   lance  late july  milano  pace   pacific  pepperidge farm   plum   pop secret  prego   royal dansk   snack factory pretzel crisps  snyders of hanover  swanson    and  v8    are protected by trademark law in the major markets where they are used 

although we own a number of valuable patents we do not regard any segment of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents in addition we own copyrights both registered and unregistered proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories this competition arises from numerous competitors of varying sizes across multiple food and beverage categories and includes producers of private label products as well as other branded food and beverage manufacturers private label products are generally sold at prices lower than prices for branded products competitors market and sell their products through traditional retailers and ecommerce all of these competitors vie for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars the number of competitors cannot be reliably estimated the principal areas of competition are brand recognition taste nutritional value price promotion innovation shelf space and customer service 

working capital 

for information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital items see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

4   

capital expenditures 

during 2018 our aggregate capital expenditures were 407 million  we expect to spend approximately 400 million for capital projects in 2019 major capital projects based on planned spend in 2019 include a us warehouse optimization project transition of production of the toronto manufacturing facility to our us thermal plants and ongoing refrigeration system replacement projects 

research and development 

during the last three fiscal years our expenditures on research and development activities relating to new products and the improvement and maintenance of existing products were 110 million  in 2018 111 million  in 2017 and 105 million  in 2016 the decrease from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to lower investments in longterm innovation and lower incentive compensation costs partially offset by the impact of acquisitions inflation and other factors the increase from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to inflation and other factors and investments in longterm innovation partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives and lower incentive compensation costs 

regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated in the us our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies including the food and drug administration department of agriculture federal trade commission department of labor department of commerce and environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the us in addition the current us administration has implemented and is considering tariffs on certain imported commodities including steel tariffs in response other countries have adopted andor considering countervailing tariffs on imported food and agriculture products 

environmental matters 

we have requirements for the operation and design of our facilities that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations of our 407 million  in capital expenditures made during 2018 approximately 12 million were for compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the us we further estimate that approximately 28 million of the capital expenditures anticipated during 2019 will be for compliance with us environmental laws and regulations we believe that continued compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations both within the us and elsewhere will not have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position in addition we continue to monitor existing and pending environmental laws and regulations within the us and elsewhere relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions while the impact of these laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

seasonality 

demand for soup products is seasonal with the fall and winter months usually accounting for the highest sales volume sales of kelsen products are also highest in the fall and winter months due primarily to holiday gift giving including the chinese new year demand for our other products is generally evenly distributed throughout the year 

employees 

on july 29 2018  we had approximately 23000 employees

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

5   

operational risk factors 

our strategy may not be successful and our business or financial results may be adversely impacted 

on august 30 2018 we announced our vision to be a leading snacks and simple meals company with a portfolio of bestinclass products and brands in our core north american market this strategy entails a refocused portfolio that includes brands concentrated in slowergrowing centerstore categories in traditional retail grocery channels factors that may impact our success include our ability to 

 • identify and capitalize on customer or consumer trends 

• design and implement effective retail execution plans 

• design and implement effective advertising and marketing programs including digital programs and 

• secure or maintain sufficient shelf space at retailers 

if we are not successful in addressing these factors or if there are changes in the underlying growth rates of the categories in which we compete our strategy may not be successful and our business or financial results may be adversely impacted 

our results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of divestitures 

on august 30 2018 we announced plans to pursue the divestiture of businesses within two operating segments our international biscuits and snacks operating segment which includes arnott’s kelsen and our operations in indonesia malaysia hong kong and japan and the campbell fresh operating segment which includes bolthouse farms garden fresh gourmet and the us refrigerated soup business we expect to use the proceeds from these divestitures to reduce debt our ability to successfully divest these businesses and any other businesses we decide to divest may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected potential risks of divestitures may also include diversion of managements attention from other business concerns loss of key employees suppliers andor customers of divested businesses the inability to separate divested businesses or business units effectively and efficiently from our existing business operations and the inability to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs if we are unable to complete or realize the projected benefits of planned andor future divestitures we may not be able to reduce our debt as planned and our business or financial results may be adversely impacted 

we incurred substantial indebtedness to finance the acquisition of snyderslance 

in connection with the closing of the acquisition of snyderslance and the payoff of snyderslance indebtedness we incurred approximately 62 billion of indebtedness through a combination of senior notes and a senior unsecured term loan facility this substantial level of indebtedness increased our debt service obligations it may also have other important consequences to our business including but not limited to 

 in addition we regularly access the commercial paper markets for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes if our credit ratings are further downgraded we may have difficulty selling additional debt securities or borrowing money in the amounts and on the terms that might be available if our credit ratings were maintained see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources for information regarding our credit ratings 

disruptions in the commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit markets may also reduce the amount of commercial paper that we can issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short and longterm debt offerings there can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms we find acceptable limitations on our ability to access the capital markets a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs may adversely affect our business and financial results 

6   

we may not realize the anticipated benefits from our cost reduction initiatives 

we are pursuing multiyear cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of 945 million by the end of 2022 which includes 295 million in synergies and runrate cost savings from our acquisition of snyderslance these initiatives will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of these initiatives and in some respects our plans to achieve these cost savings continue to be in development see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives for additional information on these initiatives these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from other business issues have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from these often complex initiatives any failure to implement our initiatives could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the anticipated benefits of acquiring snyderslance may not be fully realized or realized within the time frame that we expect 

we expect that the acquisition of snyderslance will result in various benefits including among other things cost savings cost synergies a strengthened market position and revenue opportunities achieving these anticipated benefits is subject to uncertainties including whether we integrate in an efficient and effective manner and general competitive factors in the marketplace integrating snyderslance will be a complex and timeconsuming process that requires investment we may experience unanticipated difficulties delays or expenses related to the integration including but not limited to 

 we plan to combine certain operations functions systems and processes which we may be unsuccessful or delayed in implementing in addition costs for synergies and integration may be more than anticipated and there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or timing of these expenses although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs and realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental costs over time any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all the failure to effectively address any of these risks or any other risks related to the integration of the snyderslance acquisition may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we may not be able to increase prices to fully offset increases in the cost of transportation and logistics and prices of raw and   packaging materials 

the cost of distribution has increased due to a significant rise in transportation and logistics costs driven by excess demand reduced availability and higher fuel costs in addition certain of the materials required for the manufacture of our products including steel have been or may be impacted by new or recently proposed tariffs 

as a manufacturer of food and beverage products the raw and packaging materials used in our business include tomato paste grains beef poultry dairy vegetables steel glass paper and resin many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including but not limited to changes in crop size cattle cycles crop disease crop pests product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations governmentsponsored agricultural programs import and export requirements including tariffs drought water scarcity temperature extremes scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients and other factors that may be beyond our control we may not be able to offset any price increases through productivity or price increases or through our commodity hedging activity 

we try to pass along to customers some or all cost increases through increases in the selling prices of or decreases in the packaging sizes of some of our products higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume to the extent that price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs andor if they result in significant decreases in sales volume our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

7   

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in the highly competitive food and beverage industry and experience competition in all of our categories the principal areas of competition are brand recognition taste nutritional value price promotion innovation shelf space and customer service a number of our primary competitors are larger than us and have substantial financial marketing and other resources in addition reduced barriers to entry and easier access to funding are creating new competition a strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts or a continued shift towards private label offerings could result in us reducing prices increasing marketing or other expenditures andor losing market share 

we may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customers 

our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade which has experienced slower growth than other retail channels such as dollar stores drug stores club stores and ecommerce retailers this trend away from traditional retail grocery is expected to continue in the future if we are not successful in expanding sales in growing retail channels our business or financial results may be adversely impacted in addition retailers with increased buying power and negotiating strength are seeking more favorable terms including increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers in 2018 us soup sales declined primarily due to a key customers different promotional approach for soup these customers may also use more of their shelf space for their private label products if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics our business or financial results could be adversely impacted 

in 2018 our five largest customers accounted for approximately 38  of our consolidated net sales with the largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounting for approximately 18  of our consolidated net sales there can be no assurance that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past disruption of sales to any of these customers or to any of our other large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results 

our results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is primarily based on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products packaging or ingredients whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our results could be adversely impacted 

disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to manufacture andor sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing warehousing or distribution capabilities or to the capabilities of our suppliers contract manufacturers logistics service providers or independent distributors this damage or disruption could result from execution issues as well as factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as product or raw material scarcity adverse weather conditions natural disasters fire terrorism pandemics strikes or other events production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought water scarcity temperature extremes scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients crop size cattle cycles crop disease and crop pests failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur may adversely affect our business or financial results particularly in circumstances when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location disputes with significant suppliers contract manufacturers logistics service providers or independent distributors including disputes regarding pricing or performance may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture andor sell our products as well as our business or financial results 

if our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled we might need to recall those items and we may experience product liability claims and damage to our reputation 

we have in the past and we may in the future need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury to consumers a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment a significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety andor quality of our products ingredients or packaging in addition if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in that category 

8   

our nonus operations pose additional risks to our business 

in 2018 approximately 19 of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the us our business or financial condition may be adversely affected due to the risks of doing business in these markets including but not limited to the following 

• unfavorable changes in tariffs quotas trade barriers or other export and import restrictions 

 in addition we hold assets and incur liabilities generate revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the australian dollar and the canadian dollar our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars and we must translate our assets liabilities sales and expenses into us dollars for external reporting purposes as a result changes in the value of the us dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and adversely affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their local currency 

on august 30 2018 we announced plans to pursue the divestiture of our international biscuits and snacks operating segment which includes arnott’s kelsen and our operations in indonesia malaysia hong kong and japan if and until this operating segment is divested we expect to continue to conduct business as usual in markets outside of the us 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could adversely affect our financial results and net worth   

as of july 29 2018  we had goodwill of 4580 billion  and other indefinitelived intangible assets of 3123 billion  goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise we test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including goodwill to the units fair value similarly we test indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values fair value for both goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis if the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets exceed their fair value the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair value factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates we have in the most recently completed and prior years experienced impairment charges see significant accounting estimates and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on past impairments we may be required in the future to record additional impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets which could adversely affect our financial results and net worth 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly our trademarks to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark patent copyright and trade secret protection contractual agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results 

competing intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and timeconsuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development launch and sale of certain products any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results 

9   

we may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to   our defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in the us and various nonus locations the major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets investment returns interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we may be adversely impacted by a failure or security breach of our information technology systems 

our information technology systems are critically important to our operations we rely on our information technology systems some of which are outsourced to third parties to manage our data communications and business processes including our marketing sales manufacturing procurement logistics customer service accounting and administrative functions if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect appropriate information technology systems our business or financial results could be adversely impacted furthermore our information technology systems may be vulnerable to attack or other security breaches including the access to or acquisition of customer consumer or other confidential information service disruptions or other system failures if we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve these breaches disruptions or failures our operations may be impacted and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as reputational damage litigation remediation costs andor penalties under various data privacy laws and regulations 

to address the risks to our information technology systems and the associated costs we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology and security policies cyber insurance employee training and monitoring and routine testing of our information technology systems although we have not experienced a material incident to date there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident 

we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business 

we depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results in addition activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

on may 18 2018 we announced the appointment of an interim president and chief executive officer the search for and transition to a permanent president and chief executive officer may result in disruptions to our business and uncertainty among investors employees and others concerning our future direction and performance any such disruptions and uncertainty as well as the failure to successfully identify attract or retain a permanent president and chief executive officer could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of acquisitions and other strategic transactions 

we may undertake additional acquisitions or other strategic transactions our ability to meet our objectives with respect to acquisitions and other strategic transactions may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable counterparties negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected and complete those transactions potential risks also include 

 acquisitions outside the us may present added unique challenges and increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes 

10   

market conditions and other general risk factors 

actions of activist shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs divert managements attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our business   

we have become the target of activist shareholder activities if these activities continue our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees in addition perceived uncertainties as to our future direction strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist shareholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities harm our ability to attract new investors customers employees suppliers and other strategic partners and cause our share price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation 

we face risks related to recession financial and credit market disruptions   and other economic conditions 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions recession equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the us or other nations similarly disruptions in financial andor credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors in addition changes in tax or interest rates in the us or other nations whether due to recession financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons may adversely impact us 

adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operations 

our business or financial results could be adversely affected by changing global temperatures or weather patterns or by extreme or unusual weather conditions adverse changes in the global climate or extreme or unusual weather conditions could 

 in addition there is growing concern that the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere may be impacting global temperatures and weather patterns and contributing to extreme or unusual weather conditions this growing concern may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases adoption of such additional regulation may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial results 

legal and regulatory risk factors 

we may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings or claims 

we are party to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business since these actions are inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such proceedings or claims or that our assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection with such matters will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims the marketing of food products has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal state and foreign laws or regulations in addition the independent contractor distribution model which is used by pepperidge farm and snyder’slance has come under increased regulatory scrutiny our independent contractor distribution model has also been the subject of various lawsuits in recent years in the event we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against these proceedings or claims or if our assessment of the materiality of these proceedings or claims proves inaccurate our business or financial results may be adversely affected in addition our reputation could be damaged by allegations made in proceedings or claims even if untrue 

increased regulation or changes in law could adversely affect our business or financial results

overview 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in financial statements and supplementary data as well as the information contained in risk factors 

unless otherwise stated the terms we us our and the company refer to campbell soup company and its consolidated subsidiaries 

executive summary 

we are a manufacturer and marketer of highquality branded food and beverage products we operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories on december 12 2017 we completed the acquisition of pacific foods of oregon llc pacific foods the purchase price was 688 million  on march 26 2018 we completed the acquisition of snyder’slance inc snyderslance for total consideration of 6112 billion  for additional information on our recent acquisitions see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

commencing in the third quarter of 2018 we formed a new us snacking unit which combines snyderslance and pepperidge farm and is an operating segment as of the third quarter of 2018 we have four operating segments based primarily on product type and three reportable segments the us snacking operating segment is aggregated with the international biscuits and snacks operating segment to form the global biscuits and snacks reportable segment the reportable segments are americas simple meals and beverages global biscuits and snacks and campbell fresh through the fourth quarter of 2017 our business in latin america was managed as part of the americas simple meals and beverages segment beginning in 2018 our business in latin america is managed as part of the global biscuits and snacks segment see business  reportable segments for a description of the products included in each segment 

16   

strategy 

based on a recent boardled strategy and portfolio review we announced our vision to be a leading snacks and simple meals company with a portfolio of bestinclass products and brands in our core north american market that we believe will generate sustainable value for our shareholders customers and consumers guided by our purpose   real food that matters for life’s moments  each of our brands will be driven within a framework of two differentiated portfolio roles 

 in support of this strategy we will continue to focus on the integration of snyder’slance we also announced plans to pursue the divestiture of businesses within two operating segments our international biscuits and snacks operating segment which includes arnott’s kelsen and our operations in indonesia malaysia hong kong and japan and the campbell fresh operating segment which includes bolthouse farms garden fresh gourmet and the us refrigerated soup business the international biscuits and snacks operating segment and the campbell fresh operating segment combined represent approximately 21 billion in net sales in 2018 we expect to use the proceeds from these divestitures to reduce debt 

as a result of a more focused portfolio we are pursuing increased multiyear cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of 945 million by the end of 2022 which includes 295 million in synergies and runrate cost savings from our acquisition of snyderslance we expect to achieve these additional savings by streamlining our organization expanding our zerobased budgeting efforts and continuing to optimize our manufacturing network see restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives for additional information on these initiatives 

business trends 

our businesses are being influenced by a variety of trends that we anticipate will continue in the future including changing consumer preferences a changing retail environment and significant cost inflation 

our strategy is designed in part to capture growing consumer preferences for snacking and convenience for example consumers are changing their eating habits by increasing the type and frequency of snacks they consume we also expect consumers to continue to seek products that they associate with health and wellbeing including naturally functional and organic foods 

retailers continue to use their buying power and negotiating strength to seek increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms in 2018 us soup sales declined primarily due to a key customers different promotional approach for soup we expect consolidations among retailers will continue to create large and sophisticated customers that may further this trend at the same time new and existing retailers continue to grow and promote store brands that compete with branded products in addition although ecommerce represents only a small percentage of total food sales we anticipate it will continue to grow rapidly 

the cost of distribution has increased due to a significant rise in transportation and logistics costs driven by excess demand reduced availability and higher fuel costs in addition certain ingredients and packaging required for the manufacture of our products including steel have been or may be impacted by new or recently proposed tariffs we expect these cost pressures to continue in 2019 in connection with our transition to our new us warehouse optimization model we are also experiencing significantly higher than expected cost increases and shipment delays associated with the startup of our findlay ohio distribution facility the findlay facility operated by a thirdparty logistics service provider serves as the midwest hub for distribution of campbell’s  soups swanson  broth v8  beverages and pace  prego  and plum  products additionally in september our maxton north carolina manufacturing and distribution capabilities were negatively impacted by flooding associated with hurricane florence we expect the collective impact of these cost increases shipment delays and weatherrelated issues to have a negative impact on our results of operations for the first quarter ending october 28 2018 

summary of results 

in 2018 we adopted new accounting guidance that changes the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost certain amounts in the prior year were reclassified to conform to the current presentation see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

an analysis of percent change of net sales by reportable segment follows 





 

 in 2018  americas simple meals and beverages sales decreased   1  primarily due to declines in us soup and v8 beverages partially offset by the benefit of the acquisition of pacific foods and an increase in the retail business in canada driven by the favorable impact of currency translation excluding pacific foods sales of us soup declined 8 driven by declines in condensed soups readytoserve soups and broth the decline in us soup was primarily due to a key customer’s different promotional approach for soup in 2018 

in 2017  americas simple meals and beverages sales decreased   1  primarily due to declines in v8  beverages and soup partly offset by gains in  prego  pasta sauces and spaghettios  pasta us soup sales decreased 1 due to declines in condensed soups and broth partly offset by gains in readytoserve soups gains in readytoserve soups were primarily driven by chunky  soups due to improved execution including merchandising and dedicated advertising as well as new items and the launch of well yes  soups promotional spending had a negative impact of 1 on sales with increases on broth in canada and on v8  beverages we increased promotional spending on broth and v8 beverages to remain competitive and in canada to hold certain promoted prices following list price increases 

21   

in 2018  global biscuits and snacks sales increased   31  primarily due to the 29point benefit of the acquisition of snyder’slance excluding snyder’slance and the favorable impact of currency translation sales increased primarily due to gains in pepperidge farm reflecting growth in goldfish  crackers and in cookies as well as gains of kelsen cookies in china partially offset by declines in arnott’s biscuits primarily in indonesia 

in 2017  global biscuits and snacks sales increased   1  reflecting a 1 favorable impact from currency translation excluding the favorable impact of currency translation segment sales were comparable to the prior year as gains in pepperidge farm were offset by declines in kelsen mostly in the us and in arnotts in indonesia pepperidge farm sales increased due to gains in  goldfish  crackers and in cookies benefiting from new items partly offset by declines in fresh bakery and frozen products 

in 2018  campbell fresh sales were comparable to the prior year as gains in carrot ingredients and garden fresh gourmet were offset by declines in bolthouse farms  refrigerated beverages  

in 2017  campbell fresh sales decreased   5  primarily due to lower sales of refrigerated beverages and carrots partly offset by gains in refrigerated soup the decrease in refrigerated beverages reflects the adverse impact of supply constraints related to enhanced quality processes following the voluntary recall of bolthouse farms protein plus  drinks in june 2016 the carrot sales performance reflects the market share impact of quality and execution issues experienced in 2016 as well as the adverse impact of weather conditions in the second quarter of 2017

operating earnings 

segment operating earnings decreased 5  in 2018  from 2017  and increased 1  in 2017  from 2016  

23   

an analysis of operating earnings by segment follows 



 

 operating earnings from americas simple meals and beverages decreased   12  in 2018  versus 2017  the decrease was primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage and lower sales volume partly offset by lower marketing and selling expenses gross profit performance was impacted by cost inflation including higher transportation and logistics costs and the dilutive impact from the acquisition of pacific foods 

operating earnings from americas simple meals and beverages increased   5  in 2017  versus 2016  the increase was primarily due to a higher gross profit percentage benefiting from productivity improvements and lower administrative expenses partly offset by volume declines 

operating earnings from global biscuits and snacks increased   17  in 2018  versus 2017  the increase was primarily due to the benefit of the acquisition of snyder’slance higher organic sales volume and lower marketing and selling expenses partly offset by a lower gross profit percentage gross profit performance was impacted by higher levels of cost inflation particularly on butter higher transportation and logistics costs and costs associated with the voluntary product recall of flavorblasted goldfish  crackers in july 2018 

operating earnings from global biscuits and snacks increased   7  in 2017  versus 2016  the increase was primarily due to lower administrative expenses lower marketing and selling expenses and higher sales voume 

operating earnings from campbell fresh decreased from a loss of 9 million in 2017  to a loss of 43 million in 2018  the decrease was primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage reflecting higher supply chain costs including lower manufacturing efficiencies and cost inflation as well as higher carrot costs attributable to the adverse impact of weather conditions on crop yields 

operating earnings from campbell fresh decreased  from 60 million  in 2016  to a loss of 9 million  in 2017 the decrease was primarily due to lower volume and unfavorable mix higher carrot costs which were partly associated with the adverse impact on crop yields of heavy rains in december and january of fiscal 2017 as well as excess organic carrots the cost impact of both lower beverage operating efficiencies and enhanced quality processes and higher administrative expenses 

corporate in 2018  included the following 

 corporate in 2017  included noncash impairment charges of 212 million on the intangible assets of the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit and the garden fresh gourmet reporting unit costs of 40 million related to cost savings initiatives and a 178 million  gain associated with pension and postretirement benefit marktomarket adjustments excluding these amounts the remaining decrease in costs was primarily due to higher pension and postretirement benefit income in 2018 and lower incentive compensation costs partially offset by higher administrative expenses and losses on open commodity contracts in the current year 

corporate in 2016  included a 313 million  loss associated with pension and postretirement benefit marktomarket adjustments a noncash impairment charge of 141 million  on the intangible assets of the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting 

24   

unit costs of 47 million  related to cost savings initiatives and a 25 million gain from a settlement of a claim related to the kelsen acquisition the remaining decrease in 2017 was primarily due to lower postretirement benefit costs as a result of amortization of prior service credit partially offset by investments in longterm innovation 

interest expense 

interest expense increased  to 201 million  in 2018  from 112 million  in 2017  the increase in interest expense was due to higher levels of debt associated with funding the acquisitions and higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio partially offset by a gain of 18 million on treasury rate lock contracts used to hedge the planned financing of the snyderslance acquisition 

interest expense decreased  to 112 million  in 2017  from 115 million  in 2016  in 2017  we recorded a 6 million reduction to interest expense related to premiums and fees received from the sale of intercompany notes receivable to a financial institution excluding the premium and fees interest expense increased reflecting higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio partially offset by lower average levels of debt 

taxes on earnings 

the effective tax rate was 40  in 2018  314  in 2017  and 337  in 2016  

on december 22 2017 the act was enacted into law and made significant changes to corporate taxation as a result the following items are reflected in 2018 

 the amounts recorded represent provisional amounts based on our best estimates and current interpretation of the provisions of the act and may change as additional guidance is issued see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

tax expense decreased from 406 million in 2017 to 11 million in 2018 

the following items impacted 2018 and 2017 

 after adjusting for the items above the remaining decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the ongoing benefit of the lower us federal tax rate as a result of the act 

the following items impacted the tax rate in 2016 



25   

 in addition in 2017 the effective rate was favorably impacted by the recognition of 6 million of excess tax benefits in connection with the adoption of new accounting guidance on stockbased compensation in the first quarter of 2017 

restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives 

2015 initiatives 

in fiscal 2015 we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure as part of these initiatives we commenced a voluntary employee separation program available to certain usbased salaried employees nearing retirement who met age lengthofservice and business unitfunction criteria 

in february 2017 we announced that we were expanding these initiatives by further optimizing our supply chain network primarily in north america continuing to evolve our operating model to drive efficiencies and more fully integrating our recent acquisitions in january 2018 as part of the expanded initiatives we authorized additional pretax costs to improve the operational efficiency of our thermal supply chain network in north america by closing our manufacturing facility in toronto ontario and to optimize our information technology infrastructure by migrating certain applications to the latest cloud technology platform in august 2018 we announced that we will continue to streamline our organization expand our zerobased budgeting efforts and optimize our manufacturing network we extended the time horizon for the initiatives to 2022 cost estimates for these expanded initiatives as well as timing for certain activities are continuing to be developed 

a summary of the restructuring charges and charges recorded in administrative expenses cost of products sold and marketing and selling expenses related to the initiatives is as follows 



a summary of the pretax costs associated with the initiatives is as follows 



the total estimated pretax costs for actions that have been identified are approximately 570 million  to 605 million  this estimate will be updated as costs for the expanded initiatives are developed 

we expect the costs for actions that have been identified to date to consist of the following approximately 195 million  in severance pay and benefits approximately 95 million  in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation and approximately 280 million  to 315 million  in implementation costs and other related costswe expect these pretax costs to be associated with our segments as follows americas simple meals and beverages  approximately 45  global biscuits and snacks  approximately 30  campbell fresh  approximately 3  and corporate  approximately 22  

of the aggregate 570 million  to 605 million  of pretax costs identified to date we expect approximately 465 million  to 500 million  will be cash expenditures in addition we expect to invest approximately 250 million in capital expenditures through 2020 primarily related to the us warehouse optimization project transition of production of the toronto manufacturing facility to our us thermal plants insourcing of manufacturing for certain simple meal products and optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications of which we invested approximately 114 million  as of july 29 2018  

26   

we expect to incur the costs for the actions that have been identified to date through 2020 and to fund the costs through cash flows from operations and shortterm borrowings 

we expect the initiatives for actions that have been identified to date to generate pretax savings of 470 million in 2019 and once all phases are implemented to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately 650 million by the end of 2022 the annual pretax savings generated by the initiatives were as follows 



segment operating results do not include restructuring charges implementation costs and other related costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges a summary of the pretax costs incurred to date associated with segments is as follows 



snyderslance cost transformation program and integration 

on march 26 2018 we completed the acquisition of snyderslance prior to the acquisition in april 2017 snyderslance launched a cost transformation program following a comprehensive review of its operations with the goal of significantly improving its financial performance we expect to continue to implement this program and to achieve a majority of the programs targeted savings in addition we have identified opportunities for additional cost synergies as we integrate snyderslance 

we are developing the detailed plans to implement the snyderslance cost transformation program and to achieve the cost synergies and therefore we cannot reasonably estimate the total expected pretax costs and timing of when we expect to incur those costs as well as the expected future cash expenditures we expect the pretax costs to be associated primarily with global biscuits and snacks 

in 2018  we recorded a restructuring charge of 13 million   and incurred   12 million   in administrative expenses related to the integration of snyderslance 

we expect the snyderslance cost transformation program and integration to generate pretax annual savings of 105 million in 2019 and once all phases are implemented to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately 295 million beginning in 2022 in 2018 pretax savings were 35 million 

segment operating results do not include restructuring charges nor implementation and integration costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges the pretax costs of 25 million  incurred in 2018  were associated with the global biscuits and snacks segment 

2015 initiatives and snyderslance cost transformation program and integration 

we generated annual pretax savings of 455 million in 2018 for both programs and expect once all phases of these programs are implemented to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately 945 million by the end of 2022 

2014 initiatives 

in 2014 we implemented initiatives to reduce overhead across the organization restructure manufacturing and streamline operations for our soup and broth business in china and improve supply chain efficiency in australia 

 in 2016 we recorded a reduction to restructuring charges of 4 million   3 million  after tax or 01  per share related to the 2014 initiatives as of july 31 2016 we incurred substantially all of the costs related to the 2014 initiatives 

27   

a summary of the pretax costs associated with the 2014 initiatives is as follows

liquidity and capital resources

we generated cash flows from operations of 1305 billion in 2018  compared to 1291 billion  in 2017  the increase  in 2018  was primarily due to lower working capital requirements partially offset by lower cash earnings 

we generated cash flows from operations of 1291 billion in 2017  compared to 1491 billion  in 2016  the decline  in 2017  was primarily due to lapping significant reductions in working capital in 2016 as well as lower cash earnings and lower receipts from hedging activities in 2017 

current assets are less than current liabilities as a result of our level of current maturities of longterm debt and shortterm borrowings and our focus to lower core working capital requirements by reducing trade receivables and inventories while extending payment terms for accounts payables we had negative working capital of 1298 billion  as of july 29 2018  and 495 million  as of july 30 2017  debt maturing within one year was 1896 billion  as of july 29 2018  and 1037 billion  as of july 30 2017

inflation 

we are exposed to the impact of inflation on our cost of products sold we use a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation including increasing prices commodity hedging and pursuing cost productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies and capital investments that improve the efficiency of operations 

market risk sensitivity 

the principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices in addition we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variablerate and fixedrate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variabletototal debt ratio within targeted guidelines international operations which accounted for 19 of 2018  net sales are concentrated principally in australia and canada we manage our foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing crosscurrency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts we enter into crosscurrency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments 

we principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short and longterm supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials including certain commodities and agricultural products we also enter into commodity futures options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of soybean oil wheat diesel fuel aluminum natural gas soybean meal corn cocoa butter and cheese which impact the cost of raw materials

our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations debt repayment and debt issuances market effects on debt and foreign currency and our acquisition and divestiture activities 

significant accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions 

trade and consumer promotion programs — we offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers such as feature price discounts instore display incentives cooperative advertising programs new product introduction fees and coupons the mix between promotion programs which are classified as reductions in revenue and advertising or other marketing activities which are classified as marketing and selling expenses fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues the measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors typically programs that are offered have a very short duration historically the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements however actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates 

valuation of longlived assets — fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if impairment exists if impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value 

goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill we may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a quantitative impairment test fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value goodwill is considered impaired in january 2017 the fasb issued revised guidance that simplifies the test for goodwill impairment effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 with early adoption permitted we elected to early adopt the guidance in the fourth quarter of 2017 under the revised guidance if a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the reporting unit to fair value prior to the revised guidance the amount of the impairment was the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value which was calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination 

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates weighted average cost of capital and assumed royalty rates if the carrying value exceeds fair value an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the asset to fair value 

2016 assessments 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 as part of our annual review of intangible assets we recognized an impairment charge of 106 million  on goodwill and 35 million  on a trademark within the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit which is included in the campbell fresh segment in 2016 carrot performance primarily reflected the adverse impact of weather conditions on crop yields and execution issues in response to those conditions which led to customer dissatisfaction a loss of business and higher carrot costs in the second half of the year the impairment was attributable to a decline in profitability in the second half of 2016 and a revised outlook for the business with reduced expectations for sales operating margins and discounted cash flows 

2017 assessments 

during the second quarter of 2017 sales and operating profit performance for bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients were well below our expectations due to difficulty with regaining market share lost during 2016 and higher carrot costs from the adverse impact of heavy rains on crop yields during the quarter we also lowered our forecast for sales and earnings for the reporting unit for the second half of 2017 based on revised market share recovery expectations and the continuing effect of unusual 

32   

weather conditions on carrot costs in addition as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team of campbell fresh during the second quarter we decided to reduce emphasis on growing sales of carrot ingredients which are a byproduct of the manufacturing process and to manage carrots sold at retail for modest sales growth consistent with the category while improving profitability accordingly we reduced our expectations for recovery of retail carrot market share as a consequence of the business performance and the strategic review we lowered our sales outlook for future fiscal yearswe also lowered our average margin expectations due in part to cost volatility which has been higher than expected based upon the business performance in the second quarter of 2017 our reduced nearterm outlook and reduced expectations for sales operating margins and discounted cash flows we performed an interim impairment assessment in the second quarter which resulted in a 127 million impairment charge on goodwill and 20 million on a trademark in the reporting unit 

we acquired garden fresh gourmet on june 29 2015 during 2017 sales and operating profit performance for garden fresh gourmet a reporting unit within the campbell fresh segment were well below expectations and we lowered our outlook for the second half of 2017 due to customer losses and failure to meet product distribution goals we expected to expand distribution of salsa beyond our concentration in the midwest region however this proved to be challenging as differentiated recipes are required to meet taste profiles in other parts of the country in addition as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team of campbell fresh during the second quarter we lowered our distribution and category growth expectations and therefore future sales outlook based upon the business performance in 2017 our reduced nearterm outlook and reduced expectations for sales operating margins and discounted cash flows we performed an interim impairment assessment in the second quarter which resulted in a 64 million impairment charge on goodwill and 1 million on a trademark in the reporting unit 

2018 assessments 

during the second quarter of 2018 we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit as operating performance was below expectations the business was impacted by adverse weather conditions and the implementation of enhanced quality protocols which impacted crop yields and resulted in higher costs this cost volatility continued to be higher than expected and caused us to reassess our short and longterm margin expectations for this business based on this performance we reduced our outlook for future operating margins and discounted cash flows which resulted in a 75 million impairment charge representing a writedown of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit the fair value of the trademark exceeded the carrying value which was 48 million  

during the third quarter of 2018 we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the deli reporting unit which includes garden fresh gourmet and the us refrigerated soup business within campbell fresh during the third quarter of 2018 certain of our private label refrigerated soup customers which represent a majority of the business informed us of their intention to insource production beginning in 2019 and the sales and operating profit outlook of the garden fresh gourmet business was reduced due to the anticipated loss of refrigerated soup business with these customers as well as the recent performance of the garden fresh gourmet business we revised the longterm outlook for future sales operating margins and discounted cash flows for this reporting unit which resulted in an 81 million impairment charge on goodwill representing a writedown of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit 13 million on a trademark and 11 million on plant assets in the reporting unit 

in addition we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit within the campbell fresh segment as the operating performance in the third quarter was below expectations we assessed sales performance of refrigerated beverages and key drivers impacting gross profit for the unit we revised our longterm outlook for future earnings and discounted cash flows to reflect reduced sales expectations to modest growth and decreased our gross profit outlook to reflect the inflation and manufacturing efficiency pressures that remain with the unit this revised outlook resulted in a 384 million  impairment charge on goodwill representing a writedown of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit and 130 million  on a trademark in the reporting unit 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 as part of our annual review of intangible assets we recognized an impairment charge of 54 million  on the plum  trademark in 2018 sales and operating performance were well below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins in the fourth quarter of 2018 as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team and based on recent performance we lowered our longterm outlook for future sales 

as of july 29 2018  the carrying value of goodwill was 458 billion  holding all other assumptions used in the 2018 fair value measurement constant a 1 increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital assumption would not reduce fair value of any of the reporting units below carrying value and would not result any impairment charges 

as of july 29 2018  the carrying value of indefinitelived trademarks was 3123 billion  of which 48 million  related to the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit 150 million  related to the bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit 23 million  related to the garden fresh gourmet trademark and 61 million related to the plum  trademark holding all other assumptions used in the 2018 fair value measurement constant changes in the assumptions below would reduce fair value of these trademarks and result in impairment charges of approximately 

33   



the carrying value of the pace trademark was 292 million as of july 29 2018  and the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by less than 10 holding all other assumptions used in the 2018 fair value measurement of the pace  trademark constant a 1 increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital assumption would result in an impairment charge of approximately 30 million and a 1 reduction in the revenue growth assumption would result in an impairment charge of approximately 10 million 

the carrying value of trademarks of 280 million  associated with the pacific foods acquisition and 2131 billion  associated with the snyderslance acquisition represents fair value holding all other assumptions used in the acquisition valuation measurement constant changes in the assumptions below would reduce fair value of the these trademarks and result in impairment charges of approximately 



for the remaining balance of our other trademarks holding all other assumptions used in the 2018 fair value measurement constant neither a 1 increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital assumption nor a 1 reduction in the revenue growth assumption would result in any material impairment 

the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance economic conditions market conditions and cost of capital inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control such as changes in capital markets the actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions 

if assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline potential additional impairment charges could result we will continue to monitor the valuation of our longlived assets 

see also note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets 

pension and postretirement benefits — we provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care trend rates independent actuaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states perform the required calculations to determine expense 

the discount rate is established as of our fiscal yearend measurement date in establishing the discount rate we review published market indices of highquality debt securities adjusted as appropriate for duration in addition independent actuaries apply highquality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans beginning in 2018 we changed the method we used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense income we elected to use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation of the relevant projected cash flows previously we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period we made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates this change did not affect the measurement of our benefit obligations we accounted for this change prospectively in 2018 as a change in accounting estimate  as a result of this change net periodic benefit income increased by approximately 17 million  in 2018 compared to what the net periodic benefit income would have been under the previous method 

the expected return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering our current and projected investment mix this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation longterm projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date 

34   

net periodic pension and postretirement expense income was 185 million  in 2018  258 million  in 2017  and 317 million  in 2016  

significant weightedaverage assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows 



estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows a 50basispoint decline in the discount rate would decrease expense by approximately 6 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of approximately 122 million a 50basispoint reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 10 million a onepercentagepoint increase in assumed health care costs would have no impact on postretirement service and interest cost and would not result in an immediate loss 

no contributions were made to us pension plans in 2018  2017  and 2016  contributions to nonus plans were 5 million  in 2018  and 2017  and 2 million  in 2016  we do not expect to contribute to the us pension plans in 2019 contributions to nonus plans are expected to be approximately 4 million  in 2019

income taxes — the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 

on december 22 2017 the act was enacted into law and made significant changes to corporate taxation including reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 and transitioning to a territorial system for taxation on foreign earnings along with the imposition of a transition tax in 2018 on the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings

the ingredients and packaging materials required for the manufacture of our food and beverage products are purchased from various suppliers these items are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including changes in crop size cattle cycles crop disease andor crop pests product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations governmentsponsored agricultural programs import and export requirements drought water scarcity temperature extremes scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients and other factors that may be beyond our control during the growing and harvesting seasons to help reduce some of this price volatility we use a combination of purchase orders short and longterm contracts inventory management practices and various commodity risk management tools for most of our ingredients and packaging ingredient inventories are at a peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only during certain seasons we make commitments for the purchase of such ingredients in their respective seasons at this time we do not anticipate any material restrictions on the availability of ingredients or packaging that would have a significant impact on our businesses for information on the impact of inflation see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

trademarks and technology 

as of september 20 2017 we owned over 3700 trademark registrations and applications in over 160 countries we believe our trademarks are of material importance to our business although the laws vary by jurisdiction trademarks generally are valid as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to have become generic trademark registrations generally can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use we believe that our principal brands including arnotts   bolthouse farms   campbells   garden fresh gourmet   goldfish   kjeldsens   milano  pace   pepperidge farm   plum   prego   swanson and  v8 are protected by trademark law in the major markets where they are used 

although we own a number of valuable patents we do not regard any segment of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents in addition we own copyrights both registered and unregistered proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories this competition arises from numerous competitors of varying sizes across multiple food and beverage categories and includes producers of generic and store brand products as well as other branded food and beverage manufacturers all of these competitors vie for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars the number of competitors cannot be reliably estimated the principal areas of competition are brand recognition taste quality nutritional value price advertising promotion convenience and service 

working capital 

for information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital items see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

capital expenditures 

during 2017 our aggregate capital expenditures were 338 million  we expect to spend approximately 400 million for capital projects in 2018 major capital projects based on planned spend in 2018 include a us warehouse optimization project insourcing of manufacturing for certain simple meal products and ongoing refrigeration system replacement projects 

research and development 

during the last three fiscal years our expenditures on research and development activities relating to new products and the improvement and maintenance of existing products were 98 million  in 2017 124 million  in 2016 and 117 million  in 2015 the decrease from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to gains on pension and postretirement benefit marktomarket adjustments in the current year compared to losses in the prior year increased benefits from cost savings initiatives and lower incentive compensation costs partially offset by inflation and other factors and investments in longterm innovation the increase from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to increased losses on pension and postretirement benefit marktomarket adjustments and increased costs to support longterm innovation partially offset by benefits from cost savings initiatives 

regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated in the us our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies including the food and drug administration us department of agriculture federal trade commission department of labor department of commerce and environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the us 

4   

environmental matters 

we have requirements for the operation and design of our facilities that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations of our 338 million  in capital expenditures made during 2017 approximately 14 million was for compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the us we further estimate that approximately 13 million of the capital expenditures anticipated during 2018 will be for compliance with us environmental laws and regulations we believe that continued compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations both within the us and elsewhere will not have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position in addition we continue to monitor existing and pending environmental laws and regulations within the us and elsewhere relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions while the impact of these laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

seasonality 

demand for soup products is seasonal with the fall and winter months usually accounting for the highest sales volume sales of kelsen products are also highest in the fall and winter months due primarily to holiday gift giving including the chinese new year demand for our other products is generally evenly distributed throughout the year

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

operational risk factors 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in the highly competitive food and beverage industry and experience competition in all of our categories the principal areas of competition are brand recognition taste quality nutritional value price advertising promotion convenience and service a number of our primary competitors are larger than us and have substantial financial marketing and other resources in addition reduced barriers to entry and easier access to funding are creating new competition a strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts or a continued shift towards store brand offerings could result in us reducing prices increasing marketing or other expenditures andor losing market share 

our results are dependent on strengthening our core businesses while diversifying into fastergrowing spaces 

our strategy is focused on strengthening our core businesses while diversifying our portfolio into fastergrowing spaces our core businesses are concentrated in slowergrowing centerstore categories in traditional retail grocery channels factors that may impact our success include our ability to 

• identify and capture market share in fastergrowing spaces 

 • design and implement effective retail execution plans 

• design and implement effective advertising and marketing programs including digital programs and 

• secure or maintain sufficient shelf space at retailers 

5   

if we are not successful in addressing these factors or if there are changes in the underlying growth rates of the categories in which we compete our strategy may not be successful andor our business or financial results may be adversely impacted 

we may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customers 

our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade which has experienced slower growth than alternative retail channels such as dollar stores drug stores club stores internetbased retailers and mealdelivery services this trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future if we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels our business or financial results may be adversely impacted in addition retailers with increased buying power and negotiating strength are seeking more favorable terms including increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers these customers may use more of their shelf space for their store brand products if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics our business or financial results could be adversely impacted 

in 2017 our five largest customers accounted for approximately 39  of our consolidated net sales with the largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounting for approximately 20  of our consolidated net sales there can be no assurance that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past disruption of sales to any of these customers or to any of our other large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits from our cost reduction organizational design or other initiatives 

we are pursuing a multiyear cost savings initiative with targeted annualized cost savings of 450 million by the end of 2020 in addition we are making other organizational changes including changes to our sales and supply chain functions these initiatives will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from other business issues have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale from timetotime we may also implement other information technology or related initiatives our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from these often complex initiatives any failure to implement our initiatives could adversely affect our business or financial results 

our results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of acquisitions divestitures and other strategic transactions 

we expect to continue to seek acquisitions and other strategic transactions our ability to meet our objectives with respect to acquisitions and other strategic transactions may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable counterparties negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected and complete those transactions potential risks also include 

• the inability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in a timely and costefficient manner 

• diversion of managements attention from other business concerns 

• potential loss of key employees suppliers andor customers of acquired businesses 

• assumption of unknown risks and liabilities 

• the inability to achieve anticipated benefits including revenues or other operating results 

• operating costs of acquired businesses may be greater than expected 

• the inability to promptly implement an effective control environment and 

• the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience 

acquisitions outside the us may present added unique challenges and increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes 

for divestitures our ability to meet our objectives may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected potential risks of divestitures may also include the inability to separate divested businesses or business units effectively and efficiently from our existing business operations and to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs 

disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to manufacture andor sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities or to the capabilities of our suppliers or contract manufacturers due to factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as product or raw material scarcity adverse weather conditions natural disasters fire terrorism pandemics strikes or other events production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected 

6   

by drought water scarcity temperature extremes scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients crop size cattle cycles crop disease andor crop pests failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur may adversely affect our business or financial results particularly in circumstances when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location disputes with significant suppliers or contract manufacturers including disputes regarding pricing or performance may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture andor sell our products as well as our business or financial results 

our nonus operations pose additional risks to our business 

in 2017 approximately 19 of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the us sales outside the us are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of consolidated net sales our business or financial condition may be adversely affected due to the risks of doing business in markets outside of the us including but not limited to the following 

• unfavorable changes in tariffs quotas trade barriers or other export and import restrictions 

 in addition we hold assets and incur liabilities generate revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the australian dollar and the canadian dollar our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars and we must translate our assets liabilities sales and expenses into us dollars for external reporting purposes as a result changes in the value of the us dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and adversely affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their local currency 

our results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and   packaging materials 

the raw and packaging materials used in our business include tomato paste grains beef poultry dairy vegetables steel glass paper and resin many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including changes in crop size cattle cycles crop disease andor crop pests product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations governmentsponsored agricultural programs import and export requirements drought water scarcity temperature extremes scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients and other factors that may be beyond our control to the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and packaging material prices we may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases or through our commodity hedging activity 

price increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs or may result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in the marketplace 

we expect to pass along to customers some or all cost increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs through increases in the selling prices of or decreases in the packaging sizes of some of our products higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume to the extent the price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset increased raw and packaging materials and other input costs andor if they result in significant decreases in sales volume our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

if our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled we might need to recall those items and we may experience product liability claims and damage to our reputation 

we have in the past and we may in the future need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury to consumers a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment a significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety andor quality of our products ingredients or packaging in addition if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category 

7   

our results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products packaging andor ingredients whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our results could be adversely impacted 

we may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in or security breaches of our   information technology systems 

our information technology systems are critically important to our operations we rely on our information technology systems some of which are outsourced to third parties to manage the data communications and business processes for all of our functions including our marketing sales manufacturing logistics customer service accounting and administrative functions if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure our business or financial results could be adversely impacted furthermore our information technology systems may be vulnerable to material security breaches including the access to or acquisition of customer consumer or other confidential data cyberbased attacks or other material system failures we periodically test our systems to attempt to detect vulnerabilities if we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve these events our operations may be impacted and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as reputational damage litigation remediation costs andor penalties under various data privacy laws and regulations although unauthorized users have attempted and continue to attempt to infiltrate our information technology systems we are not aware of a material security breach and all immaterial security breaches we have detected have been successfully remediated 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could adversely affect our financial results and net worth   

as of july 30 2017  we had goodwill of 2115 billion  and other indefinitelived intangible assets of 912 million  goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise we test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including goodwill to the units fair value similarly we test indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values fair value for both goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis if the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets exceed their fair value the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair value factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates see significant accounting estimates for additional information on past impairments we may be required in the future to record additional impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets which could adversely affect our financial results and net worth 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly our trademarks to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark patent copyright and trade secret protection contractual agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results 

competing intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and timeconsuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development launch and sale of certain products any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results 

we may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to   our defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in the us and various nonus locations the major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets investment returns interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

8   

we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business 

we depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results in addition activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

market conditions and other general risk factors 

we face risks related to recession financial and credit market disruptions   and other economic conditions 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions recession equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the us or other nations similarly disruptions in financial andor credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors in addition changes in tax or interest rates in the us or other nations whether due to recession financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons may adversely impact us 

adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operations 

our business or financial results could be adversely affected by changing global temperatures or weather patterns or by extreme or unusual weather conditions adverse changes in the global climate or extreme or unusual weather conditions could 

 in addition there is growing concern that the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere may be impacting global temperatures and weather patterns and contributing to extreme or unusual weather conditions this growing concern may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases adoption of such additional regulation may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

legal and regulatory risk factors 

we may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings or claims

14   

unless otherwise stated the terms we us our and the company refer to campbell soup company and its consolidated subsidiaries 

executive summary 

we are a manufacturer and marketer of highquality branded food and beverage products we operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories we manage our businesses in three divisions focused mainly on product categories the divisions which represent our operating and reportable segments are americas simple meals and beverages global biscuits and snacks and campbell fresh see business  reportable segments for a description of the products included in each segment 

our goal is to be the leading health and wellbeing food company guided by our purpose  real food that matters for life’s moments  we are pursuing this goal through a dual strategy of strengthening our core businesses while expanding into fastergrowing spaces we believe that this commitment to health and wellbeing will build shareholder value by driving sustainable profitable net sales growth 

industry trends 

our businesses are being influenced by a variety of trends that we anticipate will continue in the future including shifting demographics changing consumer preferences for food technological and digital advancements that are reshaping the retailer landscape and the consumer shopping experience and socioeconomic shifts 

we believe millennials and generation z are replacing baby boomers as the key influencers of societal and cultural norms in the us and are increasingly focused on health and wellbeing we expect consumers to continue to seek products that they associate with health and wellbeing including fresh naturally functional and organic foods while demanding products with these qualities consumers also continue to gravitate toward store brands and value offerings consumers are also changing their eating habits by increasing the type and frequency of snacks consumed 

digital media and technology are changing the way consumers purchase food although ecommerce represents only a small percent of total food sales we anticipate it will accelerate rapidly through the growth of pureplay etailers increased focus of brick and mortar retailers on ecommerce and the continued growth of meal delivery services consumers are also increasingly using technology to customize their diets for their individual lifestyle physiology and health goals 

retailers continue to use their buying power and negotiating strength to seek increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms we expect consolidations among retailers will continue to create large and sophisticated customers that may further this trend in addition new and existing retailers continue to grow and promote store brands that compete with branded products 

strategic imperatives 

we are responding to the abovedescribed industry trends by continuing to focus on four strategic imperatives 

 building greater trust with consumers through real food transparency and sustainability 

our goal is to strengthen the trust of our consumers and customers through real food for example we are in the process of removing artificial flavors and colors from certain of our products increasing the use of vegetables and whole grains and transitioning to chicken with no antibiotics we have also removed bisphenol a bpa from the lining of our us and canadian soup cans in addition we recently entered into an agreement with the sage project to partner on customizable and digital labels for our products that include nutrition facts and product attributes we also support and remain committed to mandatory national genetically modified organism labeling and implementation of the food and drug administrations nutrition facts panel our wwwwhatsinmyfoodcom website promotes transparency by providing consumers with a wide range of details about how certain of our foods and beverages are made and the choices behind the ingredients we use in those products 

accelerating digital marketing and ecommerce efforts 

we are responding to the growing consumer shift to digital and mobile technologies by investing in digital and ecommerce across our company with a goal of building industryleading capabilities we are working to increase the scale of our digital marketing capabilities using content marketing technology and data analytics we are building an experienced business team in north america to pursue these initiatives we are also pursuing digital and ecommerce innovation with new business models and development of crossportfolio ecommerce solutions to support these efforts we are developing a more flexible and cost effective 

15   

distribution system that we believe will position us well to grow with the expanding ecommerce market we also plan to continue partnering with leading ecommerce companies such as our recently announced partnership with a mealdelivery service 

continuing to diversify our portfolio in fresh foods and health and wellbeing 

capitalizing on recent consumer and retailer trends we are continuing to increase our portfolios commitment to fresh food and health and wellbeing through internal innovation changes to recipes and our recent acquisitions we expect to continue expanding our product offerings in key growth areas such as in the packaged fresh category and with organic and clean label products we are focusing on naturally functional foods by leveraging our vegetable and whole grain capabilities while we are working to develop brands and innovate these products we are developing increased distribution capabilities in new channels that also support this commitment 

increasing our presence in the fastergrowing snacking category 

through a companywide approach we plan to expand our brand footprint by driving our existing snacking portfolio pursuing expansion in promising emerging markets building global brands and leveraging global capabilities to build sustainable business models we are pursuing this goal with a plan to reach new consumers and existing consumers more frequently including new snacking products that are premium snacks and focused on health and wellbeing we also intend to broaden our snacking business beyond cookies and baked snacks to include soup mini meals and fresh snacks in addition we expect to introduce snack products with new packaging formats 

to support these four imperatives we will continue to pursue different models of innovation including internal and external development disciplined mergers and acquisitions strategic partnerships and venture investing 

cost savings initiative 

we are pursuing a multiyear cost savings initiative with targeted annualized cost savings of 450 million by the end of 2020 these savings are above and beyond our existing supplychain productivity initiatives see restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives for additional information on these initiatives we expect to reinvest a portion of these savings into the businesses that we have identified as high growth and that are consistent with our strategic imperatives

an analysis of percent change of net sales by reportable segment follows 





 

 in 2017 americas simple meals and beverages sales decreased   1  primarily due to declines in v8  beverages and soup partly offset by gains in  prego  pasta sauces and campbells  pasta us soup sales decreased 1 due to declines in condensed soups and broth partly offset by gains in readytoserve soups gains in readytoserve soups were primarily driven by campbell’s chunky  soups due to improved execution including merchandising and dedicated advertising as well as new items and the launch of well yes  soups promotional spending had a negative impact of 1 on sales with increases on broth in canada and on v8  beverages we increased promotional spending on broth and v8 beverages to remain competitive and in canada to hold certain promoted prices following list price increases for 2018 we were unable to reach an agreement with a large customer on a promotional program for us soup as a result we expect our us soup sales to decline in 2018 

in 2016 americas simple meals and beverages sales decreased   2  sales decreased primarily due to declines in soup and v8  beverages partially offset by gains in prego  pasta sauces plum  products and pace mexican sauces us soup sales decreased 4 primarily as a result of the impact of our net price realization actions and category declines which were partly related to warmer weather further details of us soup include 

 v8 beverages continued to be under pressure from competition from specialty and packaged fresh beverages 

in 2017 global biscuits and snacks sales increased   1  reflecting a 1 favorable impact from currency translation excluding the favorable impact of currency translation segment sales were comparable to the prior year as gains in pepperidge farm were offset by declines in kelsen mostly in the us and in arnotts in indonesia pepperidge farm sales increased due to gains in  goldfish  crackers and in cookies benefiting from new items partly offset by declines in fresh bakery and frozen products 

in 2016 global biscuits and snacks sales decreased   3  reflecting a 4 negative impact from currency translation excluding the negative impact of currency translation segment sales increased primarily due to gains in goldfish  crackers and arnotts biscuits in australia partially offset by declines in kelsen 

in 2017 campbell fresh sales decreased   5  primarily due to lower sales of refrigerated beverages and carrots partly offset by gains in refrigerated soup the decrease in refrigerated beverages reflects the adverse impact of supply constraints related to enhanced quality processes following the voluntary recall of bolthouse farms protein plus  drinks in june 2016 the carrot sales performance reflects the market share impact of quality and execution issues experienced in 2016 as well as the adverse impact of weather conditions in the second quarter of 2017 

19   

in 2016 campbell fresh sales increased   5  primarily due to the acquisition of garden fresh gourmet which was acquired on june 29 2015 excluding the acquisition sales declined reflecting lower sales in carrots and carrot ingredients partially offset by gains in refrigerated beverages and salad dressings in 2016 carrot sales performance primarily reflected the adverse impact of weather conditions on crop yields and execution issues in response to those conditions which led to customer dissatisfaction and a loss of business in the second half of the year the increase in refrigerated beverages was primarily due to new product launches partially offset by the impact of the voluntary recall of bolthouse farms   protein plus  drinks in june 2016 in 2016 promotional spending was increased to remain competitive and to support new product launches

20   

cost savings initiatives approximately 6 percentage points and the impact of currency translation approximately 1 percentage point 

research and development expenses

an analysis of operating earnings by segment follows 



 

 operating earnings from americas simple meals and beverages increased   5  in 2017  versus 2016  the increase was primarily due to a higher gross profit percentage benefiting from productivity improvements and lower administrative expenses partly offset by volume declines 

operating earnings from americas simple meals and beverages increased   13  in 2016  versus 2015  the increase was primarily due to a higher gross profit percentage benefiting from productivity improvements and increased net price realization as well as lower marketing and selling expenses partially offset by volume declines 

operating earnings from global biscuits and snacks increased   8  in 2017  versus 2016  the increase was primarily due to lower administrative expenses lower marketing and selling expenses and the favorable impact of currency translation 

21   

operating earnings from global biscuits and snacks increased   10  in 2016  versus 2015  the increase was primarily due to a higher gross profit percentage volume gains lower selling expenses and lower administrative expenses partly offset by the negative impact of currency translation and higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses 

operating earnings from campbell fresh decreased  from 60 million in 2016  to a loss of 9 million in 2017  the decrease was primarily due to lower volume and unfavorable mix higher carrot costs which were partly associated with the adverse impact on crop yields of heavy rains in december and january of this fiscal year as well as excess organic carrots the cost impact of both lower beverage operating efficiencies and enhanced quality processes and higher administrative expenses 

operating earnings from campbell fresh decreased   2  in 2016  versus 2015  the decrease was primarily due to higher carrot costs and the impact of the voluntary recall of bolthouse farms   protein plus  drinks and the related production outages partially offset by productivity improvements and lower administrative expenses

corporate in 2015  included a 138 million  loss associated with pension and postretirement benefit marktomarket adjustments and costs of 22 million  related to the implementation of our new organizational structure and cost savings initiatives the remaining increase in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in pension benefit cost resulting from a reduction in expected return on assets partially offset by lower interest cost 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased  to 112 million  in 2017  from 115 million  in 2016  in 2017  we recorded a 6 million reduction to interest expense related to premiums and fees received from the sale of intercompany notes receivable to a financial institution excluding the premium and fees interest expense increased reflecting higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio partially offset by lower average levels of debt 

interest expense increased  to 115 million  in 2016  from 108 million  in 2015  reflecting higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio partially offset by lower average levels of debt 

taxes on earnings 

the effective tax rate was 314  in 2017  337  in 2016  and 298  in 2015  

the following items impacted the tax rate in 2017 and 2016

in 2015 we recognized a tax benefit of 51 million on 138 million of pension and postretirement benefit marktomarket losses and a 46 million tax benefit on 124 million of restructuring charges and implementation costs after adjusting for the 

22   

items above the remaining increase in the effective tax rate in 2016 was primarily due to lapping the favorable resolution of an intercompany pricing agreement between the us and canada in 2015 

restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives 

2015 initiatives 

on january 29 2015 we announced plans to implement a new enterprise design focused mainly on product categories under the new structure which we fully implemented at the beginning of 2016 our businesses are organized in the following divisions americas simple meals and beverages global biscuits and snacks and campbell fresh 

in support of the new structure we designed and implemented a new integrated global services organization to deliver shared services across the company we also streamlined our organizational structure implemented an initiative to reduce overhead across the organization and are pursuing other initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness such as adopting zerobased budgeting over time as part of these initiatives we commenced a voluntary employee separation program available to certain usbased salaried employees nearing retirement who met age lengthofservice and business unitfunction criteria a total of 471  employees elected the program the electing employees remained with us through at least july 31 2015 with some remaining beyond that date 

in february 2017 we announced that we are expanding these cost savings initiatives by further optimizing our supply chain network primarily in north america continuing to evolve our operating model to drive efficiencies and more fully integrating our recent acquisitions we have extended the time horizon for the initiatives from 2018 to 2020 cost estimates for these expanded initiatives as well as timing for certain activities are being developed 

a summary of the restructuring charges we recorded and charges incurred in administrative expenses and cost of products sold related to the implementation of the new organizational structure and costs savings initiatives is as follows 



a summary of the pretax costs associated with the initiatives is as follows 



the total estimated pretax costs for actions that have been identified are approximately 380 million  to 420 million  this estimate will be updated as costs for the expanded initiatives are developed 

we expect the costs for actions that have been identified to date to consist of the following approximately 135 million  in severance pay and benefits approximately 20 million  in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation and approximately 225 million  to 265 million  in implementation costs and other related costswe expect these pretax costs to be associated with our segments as follows americas simple meals and beverages  approximately 30  global biscuits and snacks  approximately 38  campbell fresh  approximately 4  and corporate  approximately 28  

of the aggregate 380 million  to 420 million  of pretax costs identified to date we expect approximately 350 million  to 390 million  will be cash expenditures in addition we expect to invest approximately 180 million in capital expenditures through 2019 primarily related to the construction of a network of distribution centers for our us thermal plants and insourcing of manufacturing for certain simple meal products of which we invested approximately 10 million  as of july 30 2017  

we expect to incur substantially all of the costs through 2019 and to fund the costs through cash flows from operations and shortterm borrowings 

23   

we expect the initiatives for actions that have been identified to date to generate pretax savings of 390 million in 2018 and once all phases are implemented to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately 450 million beginning in 2020 the annual pretax savings generated by the initiatives were as follows 



segment operating results do not include restructuring charges implementation costs and other related costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges a summary of the pretax costs incurred to date associated with segments is as follows 



2014 initiatives 

in 2014 we implemented initiatives to reduce overhead across the organization restructure manufacturing and streamline operations for our soup and broth business in china and improve supply chain efficiency in australia

liquidity and capital resources

we generated cash flows from operations of 1291 billion in 2017  compared to 1491 billion  in 2016  the decline  in 2017  was primarily due to lapping significant reductions in working capital in the prior year as well as lower cash earnings and lower receipts from hedging activities in the current year 

we generated cash flows from operations of 1491 billion in 2016  compared to 1206 billion  in 2015  the increase  in 2016  was primarily due to higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements primarily inventories 

current assets are less than current liabilities as a result of our level of current maturities of longterm debt and shortterm borrowings and our focus to lower core working capital requirements by reducing trade receivables and inventories while extending payment terms for accounts payables we had negative working capital of 495 million  as of july 30 2017  and 647 million  as of july 31 2016  debt maturing within one year was 1037 billion  as of july 30 2017  and 1219 billion  as of july 31 2016

inflation 

we are exposed to the impact of inflation on our cost of products sold we use a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation including increasing prices commodity hedging and pursuing cost productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies and capital investments that improve the efficiency of operations 

market risk sensitivity 

the principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices in addition we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variablerate and fixedrate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variabletototal debt ratio within targeted guidelines international operations which accounted for 19 of 2017  net sales are concentrated principally in australia and canada we manage our foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing crosscurrency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts we enter into crosscurrency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments 

26

we enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of our capital stock the total return of the vanguard institutional index and the total return of the vanguard total international stock index under these contracts we pay variable interest rates and receive from the counterparty either the total return on our capital stock the total return of the standard  poors 500 index which is expected to approximate the total return of the vanguard institutional index or the total return of the ishares msci eafe index which is expected to approximate the total return of the vanguard total international stock index the notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return on our capital stock was 9 million  at july 30 2017  and 15 million  at july 31 2016  the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract which expires in april 2018  was 182  at july 30 2017  the notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the standard  poors 500 index was 26 million  at july 30 2017  and 22 million  at july 31 2016  the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract which expires in march 2018  was 166  at july 30 2017  the notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return of the ishares msci eafe index was 8 million  at july 30 2017  and 7 million  at july 31 2016  the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract which expires in march 2018  was 141  at july 30 2017  the fair value of these contracts was not material at july 30 2017  and july 31 2016  

our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations debt repayment and debt issuances market effects on debt and foreign currency and our acquisition and divestiture activities 

significant accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions 

trade and consumer promotion programs — we offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers such as feature price discounts instore display incentives cooperative advertising programs new product introduction fees and coupons the mix between promotion programs which are classified as reductions in revenue and advertising or other marketing activities which are classified as marketing and selling expenses fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues the measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors typically programs that are offered have a very short duration historically the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements however actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates 

valuation of longlived assets — fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if impairment exists if impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value 

goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill we may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a quantitative impairment test fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value goodwill is considered impaired in january 2017 the fasb issued revised guidance that simplifies the test for goodwill impairment effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 with early adoption 

28   

permitted under the revised guidance if a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the reporting unit to fair value prior to the revised guidance the amount of the impairment was the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value which was calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination 

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates weighted average cost of capital and assumed royalty rates if the carrying value exceeds fair value an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the asset to fair value 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 as part of our annual review of intangible assets we recognized an impairment charge of 6 million  on minor trademarks used in the global biscuits and snacks segment the trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 as part of our annual review of intangible assets we recognized an impairment charge of 106 million  on goodwill and 35 million  on a trademark within the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit which is included in the campbell fresh segment in 2016 carrot performance primarily reflected the adverse impact of weather conditions on crop yields and execution issues in response to those conditions which led to customer dissatisfaction a loss of business and higher carrot costs in the second half of the year the impairment was attributable to a decline in profitability in the second half of 2016 and a revised outlook for the business with reduced expectations for sales operating margins and discounted cash flows 

during the second quarter of 2017 sales and operating profit performance for bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients were well below our revised expectations due to difficulty with regaining market share lost during 2016 and higher carrot costs from the adverse impact of heavy rains on crop yields during the quarter we also lowered our forecast for sales and earnings for the reporting unit for the second half of 2017 based on revised market share recovery expectations and the continuing effect of unusual weather conditions on carrot costs in addition as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team of campbell fresh during the second quarter we decided to reduce emphasis on growing sales of carrot ingredients which are a byproduct of the manufacturing process and to manage carrots sold at retail for modest sales growth consistent with the category while improving profitability accordingly we reduced our expectations for recovery of retail carrot market share as a consequence of currentyear performance and the strategic review we lowered our sales outlook for future fiscal yearswe also lowered our average margin expectations due in part to cost volatility which has been higher than expected based upon the business performance in the second quarter of 2017 our reduced nearterm outlook and reduced expectations for sales operating margins and discounted cash flows we performed an interim impairment assessment as of december 31 2016 which resulted in a 127 million impairment charge on goodwill and 20 million on a trademark in the reporting unit the updated cash flow projections include expectations that operating margins will improve from reduced levels in 2016 and 2017 we performed our annual review of intangible assets in the fourth quarter our longterm outlook for the business is consistent with the second quarter assessment we will continue to monitor the performance of the business 

we acquired garden fresh gourmet on june 29 2015 during 2017 sales and operating profit performance for garden fresh gourmet which is a reporting unit within the campbell fresh segment were well below expectations and we lowered our outlook for the second half of 2017 due to customer losses and failure to meet product distribution goals we expected to expand distribution of salsa beyond our concentration in the midwest region however this proved to be challenging as differentiated recipes are required to meet taste profiles in other parts of the country in addition as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team of campbell fresh during the second quarter we lowered our distribution and category growth expectations and therefore future sales outlook based upon the business performance in 2017 our reduced nearterm outlook and reduced expectations for sales operating margins and discounted cash flows we performed an interim impairment assessment as of december 31 2016 which resulted in a 64 million impairment charge on goodwill and 1 million on a trademark in the reporting unit the updated cash flow projections include expectations that we will build distribution in the us operating margins will expand partly driven by the benefits from further integration and sales growth rates will exceed the companys overall sales growth rates we performed our annual review of intangible assets in the fourth quarter our longterm outlook for the business is consistent with the second quarter assessment we will continue to monitor the performance of the business 

during the third quarter of 2017 we reduced our expectations for 2017 bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings sales performance principally due to constrained production capacity related to the voluntary recall of bolthouse farms protein plus drinks in the fourth quarter of 2016 consistent with the strategic review conducted during the second quarter we expect that the rate of future sales growth will be above the companys overall sales growth but from a lower base in 2017 we continue to focus on improving profitability by pursuing various supply chain initiatives while we did not believe that an interim impairment assessment was required we performed a sensitivity analysis for the bolthouse farms  refrigerated beverages and salad dressings trademark and goodwill as of the third quarter we concluded that the trademark and reporting unit had risk of decreasing coverage we performed our annual review of intangible assets in the fourth quarter which indicated the fair value of the reporting unit and the trademark exceeded the respective carrying values by less than 10 the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit was 384 million at july 30 2017 the carrying value of the trademark related to the bolthouse farms 

29   

refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit was 280 million at july 30 2017 we will continue to monitor the performance of the business 

the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance economic conditions market conditions and cost of capital inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control such as changes in capital markets the actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions 

as of july 30 2017  the carrying value of goodwill was 2115 billion  of which 75 million  related to the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit and 52 million  related to the garden fresh gourmet reporting unit each of which approximates fair value as a result of the impairment charges in 2017 goodwill related to the bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit was 384 million as of july 30 2017 for the reporting units which comprised substantially all of the remaining goodwill the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by at least 30 as of the 2017 measurement excluding the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit the bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit and the garden fresh gourmet reporting unit holding all other assumptions used in the 2017  fair value measurement constant a 1 increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital assumption for our other reporting units would not result in any material impairment 

holding all other assumptions used in the 2017 fair value measurement constant changes in the assumptions below would reduce fair value of the three reporting units and result in impairment charges of approximately 



 

 if assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline potential additional impairment charges could result 

as of july 30 2017  the carrying value of indefinitelived trademarks was 912 million  of which 48 million  related to the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit 280 million  related to the bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit and 37 million  related to the garden fresh gourmet reporting unit holding all other assumptions used in the 2017 fair value measurement constant changes in the weightedaverage cost of capital assumption would reduce fair value of the trademarks and result in impairment charges of approximately 



holding all other assumptions used in the 2017 fair value measurement constant a 1 reduction in the revenue growth assumption would not result in any material impairment on these trademarks 

the carrying value of the pace trademark was 292 million as of july 30 2017 and the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by less than 10 holding all other assumptions used in the 2017 fair value measurement of the pace  trademark constant a 1 increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital assumption would result in an impairment charge of approximately 30 million and a 1 reduction in the revenue growth assumption would result in an impairment charge of approximately 10 million 

for all of our other trademarks holding all other assumptions used in the 2017 fair value measurement constant neither a 1 increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital assumption nor a 1 reduction in the revenue growth assumption would result in any material impairment 

if assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline potential additional impairment charges could result

pension and postretirement benefits — we provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care trend rates independent actuaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states perform the required calculations to determine expense 

the discount rate is established as of our fiscal yearend measurement date in establishing the discount rate we review published market indices of highquality debt securities adjusted as appropriate for duration in addition independent actuaries apply highquality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans beginning in 2018 we will change the method we use to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense we will use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation of the relevant projected cash flows previously we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period we are making this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates this change will not affect the measurement of our benefit obligations we will account for this change prospectively in 2018 as a change in accounting estimate  

the expected return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering our current and projected investment mix this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation longterm projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date 

net periodic pension and postretirement expense income was 258 million  in 2017  317 million  in 2016  and 125 million  in 2015  

significant weightedaverage assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows 



estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows a 50basispoint decline in the discount rate would decrease expense by approximately 7 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of approximately 135 million   a 50basispoint reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 11 million a onepercentagepoint increase in assumed health care costs would have no impact on postretirement service and interest cost and would result in an immediate loss recognition of 3 million 

no contributions were made to us pension plans in 2017  2016  and 2015  contributions to nonus plans were 5 million  in 2017  2 million  in 2016  and 5 million  in 2015  we do not expect to contribute to the us pension plans in 2018 contributions to nonus plans are expected to be approximately 5 million  in 2018

income taxes — the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized

 see also note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our reportable segments 

3   

ingredients and packaging 

the ingredients and packaging materials required for the manufacture of our food products are purchased from various suppliers these items are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors including changes in crop size cattle cycles disease andor pests product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations governmentsponsored agricultural programs import and export requirements drought water scarcity temperature extremes scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients and other factors that may be beyond our control including natural disasters during the growing and harvesting seasons to help reduce some of this price volatility we use a combination of purchase orders short and longterm contracts inventory management practices and various commodity risk management tools for most of our ingredients and packaging ingredient inventories are at a peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only during certain seasons we make commitments for the purchase of such ingredients in their respective seasons at this time we do not anticipate any material restrictions on the availability of ingredients or packaging that would have a significant impact on our businesses for information on the impact of inflation see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

customers 

in most of our markets sales and merchandising activities are conducted through our own sales force andor thirdparty brokers and distribution partners in the us canada and latin america our products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains mass discounters mass merchandisers club stores convenience stores drug stores dollar stores and other retail commercial and noncommercial establishments pepperidge farm also has a directstoredelivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors in the asia pacific region our products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains convenience stores and other retail commercial and noncommercial establishments we make shipments promptly after acceptance of orders 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 40  of our consolidated net sales in 2016 38  in 2015 and 35  in 2014 our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 20  of our consolidated net sales in 2016 and 2015 and 19  in 2014 all of our reportable segments sold products to walmart stores inc or its affiliates no other customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

trademarks and technology 

as of september 14 2016 we owned over 3650 trademark registrations and applications in over 160 countries we believe our trademarks are of material importance to our business although the laws vary by jurisdiction trademarks generally are valid as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to have become generic trademark registrations generally can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use we believe that our principal brands including arnotts bolthouse farms campbells garden fresh gourmet goldfish kjeldsens pace pepperidge farm plum prego swanson and  v8 are protected by trademark law in the major markets where they are used 

although we own a number of valuable patents we do not regard any segment of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents in addition we own copyrights both registered and unregistered proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

competition 

we experience worldwide competition in all of our principal products this competition arises from numerous competitors of varying sizes across multiple food and beverage categories and includes producers of generic and private label products as well as other branded food and beverage manufacturers all of these competitors vie for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars the number of competitors cannot be reliably estimated the principal areas of competition are brand recognition taste quality price advertising promotion convenience and service 

working capital 

for information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital items see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

capital expenditures 

during 2016 our aggregate capital expenditures were 341 million  we expect to spend approximately 350 million  for capital projects in 2017 major capital projects based on planned spend in 2017 include an ongoing australian multipack biscuit capacity expansion project and pepperidge farm refrigeration system replacement projects 

research and development 

during the last three fiscal years our expenditures on research and development activities relating to new products and the improvement and maintenance of existing products were 124 million  in 2016 117 million  in 2015 and 122 million  in 2014 

4   

the increase from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to increased losses on pension and postretirement benefit marktomarket adjustments and increased costs to support longterm innovation partially offset by benefits from cost savings initiatives the decrease from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to benefits from cost savings initiatives partially offset by increased losses on pension and postretirement benefit marktomarket adjustments 

regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated in the us our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies including the food and drug administration us department of agriculture federal trade commission department of labor department of commerce and environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the us 

environmental matters 

we have requirements for the operation and design of our facilities that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations of our 341 million  in capital expenditures made during 2016 approximately 7 million was for compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the us we further estimate that approximately 18 million of the capital expenditures anticipated during 2017 will be for compliance with us environmental laws and regulations we believe that continued compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations both within the us and elsewhere will not have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position in addition we continue to monitor existing and pending environmental laws and regulations within the us and elsewhere relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions while the impact of these laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

seasonality 

demand for soup products is seasonal with the fall and winter months usually accounting for the highest sales volume sales of kelsen products are also highest in the fall and winter months due primarily to holiday gift giving including the chinese new year demand for our other products is generally evenly distributed throughout the year 

employees 

on july 31 2016  we had approximately 16500 employees

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

operational risk factors 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in the highly competitive food and beverage industry and experience global competition in all of our principal products the principal areas of competition are brand recognition taste quality price advertising promotion convenience and service a number of our primary competitors are larger than us and have substantial financial marketing and other resources in addition reduced barriers to entry and easier access to funding may create new competition a strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts or a consumer shift towards private label offerings could result in us reducing pricing increasing marketing or other expenditures andor losing market share 

5   

our results are dependent on strengthening our core businesses while diversifying into fastergrowing spaces 

 our strategy is focused on strengthening our core businesses while diversifying our portfolio into fastergrowing spaces our core businesses are concentrated in slowergrowing centerstore categories in traditional retail grocery channels factors that may impact our success include 

• our ability to identify and capture market share in fastergrowing spaces 

 • our ability to design and implement effective retail execution plans 

• our ability to design and implement effective advertising and marketing programs including digital programs 

• our ability to secure or maintain sufficient shelf space at retailers and 

• changes in underlying growth rates of the categories in which we compete 

if we are not successful in addressing these factors our strategy may not be successful andor our business or financial results may be adversely impacted 

we may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customers 

our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade alternative retail channels such as dollar stores drug stores club stores and internetbased retailers have increased their market share this trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future if we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels our business or financial results may be adversely impacted in addition consolidations in the traditional retail grocery trade have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek lower prices increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers or more favorable terms these customers may use more of their shelf space for their private label products if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics our business or financial results could be adversely impacted 

in 2016 our five largest customers accounted for approximately 40  of our consolidated net sales with the largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounting for approximately 20  of our consolidated net sales there can be no assurance that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past disruption of sales to any of these customers or to any of our other large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits from our cost reduction organizational design or other initiatives 

in the beginning of 2016 we implemented a new enterprise design focused mainly on product categories we are also pursuing related initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness such as adopting zerobased budgeting over time these initiatives will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from other business issues have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale from timetotime we may also implement other supply chain information technology or related initiatives our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from these initiatives which are often complex any failure to implement our initiatives could adversely affect our business or financial results 

our results may be adversely affected by the failure to execute acquisitions and divestitures successfully 

we expect to seek acquisitions and investment opportunities our ability to meet our objectives with respect to the acquisition of new businesses or the divestiture of existing businesses may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers and sellers negotiate favorable financial terms and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals potential risks of acquisitions also include 

• the inability to integrate acquired businesses efficiently into our existing operations 

• diversion of managements attention from other business concerns 

• potential loss of key employees andor customers of acquired businesses 

• potential assumption of unknown liabilities 

• the inability to implement promptly an effective control environment and 

• the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience 

acquisitions outside the us may present unique challenges and increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes for divestitures potential risks may also 

6   

include the inability to separate divested businesses or business units from us effectively and efficiently and to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs 

disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to manufacture andor sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities or to the capabilities of our suppliers or contract manufacturers due to factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as product or raw material scarcity adverse weather conditions natural disasters fire terrorism pandemics strikes or other events production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought water scarcity temperature extremes scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients crop size cattle cycles crop disease andor crop pests failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur may adversely affect our business or financial results particularly in circumstances when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location disputes with significant suppliers or contract manufacturers including disputes regarding pricing or performance may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture andor sell our products as well as our business or financial results 

our nonus operations pose additional risks to our business 

in 2016 approximately 19 of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the us our strategy depends in part on expanding our operations in developing markets sales outside the us are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of consolidated net sales our business or financial performance may be adversely affected due to the risks of doing business in markets outside of the us including but not limited to the following 

• unfavorable changes in tariffs quotas trade barriers or other export and import restrictions 

 in addition we hold assets and incur liabilities generate revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the australian dollar and the canadian dollar our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars and we must translate our assets liabilities sales and expenses into us dollars for external reporting purposes as a result changes in the value of the us dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and adversely affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their local currency 

our results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and   packaging materials 

the raw and packaging materials used in our business include tomato paste grains beef poultry vegetables steel glass paper and resin many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including crop size cattle cycles disease andor pests product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations governmentsponsored agricultural programs import and export requirements drought water scarcity temperature extremes scarcity of suitable agricultural land scarcity of organic ingredients and other factors that may be beyond our control including natural disasters to the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and packaging material prices we may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases or through our commodity hedging activity 

price increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs or may result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in the marketplace 

we intend to pass along to customers some or all cost increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs through increases in the selling prices of or decreases in the packaging sizes of some of our products higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume to the extent the price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset increased raw and packaging materials and other input costs andor if they result in significant decreases in sales volume our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected

if our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled we might need to recall those items and we may experience product liability claims and damage to our reputation 

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury to consumers a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment a significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety andor quality of our products ingredients or packaging in addition if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category 

our results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products packaging andor ingredients whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our results could be adversely impacted 

we may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in or security breaches of our   information technology systems 

our information technology systems are critically important to our operations we rely on our information technology systems some of which are outsourced to third parties to manage the data communications and business processes for all of our functions including our marketing sales manufacturing logistics customer service accounting and administrative functions if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure our business or financial results could be adversely impacted furthermore our information technology systems may be vulnerable to material security breaches including the access to or acquisition of customer consumer or other confidential data cyberbased attacks or other material system failures if we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve these events our operations may be impacted and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as reputational damage litigation remediation costs andor penalties under various data privacy laws and regulations although unauthorized users have attempted and continue to attempt to infiltrate our information technology systems we have not detected a material security breach and all immaterial security breaches we have detected have been successfully remediated 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could adversely affect our financial results and net worth   

as of july 31 2016  we had goodwill of 2263 billion  and other indefinitelived intangible assets of 927 million  goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise we test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including goodwill to the units fair value similarly we test indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values fair value for both goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis if the carrying values of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets exceed their fair value the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair value factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 as part of our annual review of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we recognized a noncash impairment charge of 141 million  127 million after tax or 41 per share on the intangible assets of the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit which is part of the campbell fresh segment see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business 

we depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results in addition activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results

 in addition there is growing concern that the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere may be impacting global temperatures and weather patterns and contributing to extreme or unusual weather conditions this growing concern may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases adoption of such additional regulation may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

legal and regulatory risk factors 

we may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings or claims 

we are party to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business since these actions are inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such proceedings or claims or that our assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection with such matters will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims the marketing of food products has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal state and foreign laws or regulations in addition the independent contractor distribution model which is used by pepperidge farm has come under increased legal and regulatory scrutiny in recent years we have a few putative state law class action lawsuits challenging the independent 

9   

contractor classification of a small percentage of the total pepperidge farm distribution network we are contesting class certification and the merits in each lawsuit and plan to defend against these claims vigorously in the event we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against these proceedings or claims or if our assessment of the materiality of these proceedings or claims proves inaccurate our business or financial results may be adversely affected in addition our reputation could be damaged by allegations made in proceedings or claims even if untrue

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in financial statements and supplementary data as well as the information contained in risk factors 

unless otherwise stated the terms we us our and the company refer to campbell soup company and its consolidated subsidiaries 

 as of the beginning of 2016 we manage our businesses in three divisions focused mainly on product categories the new divisions which represent our operating and reportable segments are as follows americas simple meals and beverages global biscuits and snacks and campbell fresh see business  reportable segments for a description of the products included in each segment in 2016 we modified our method of allocating pension and postretirement benefit costs to segments through 2015 we included all components of benefit expense in measuring segment performance in 2016 only service cost is allocated to segments all other components of expense including interest cost expected return on assets and recognized actuarial gains and losses are reflected in corporate and not included in segment operating results 

in 2016 we elected to change our method of accounting for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans and the calculation of expected return on pension plan assets historically actuarial gains and losses associated with benefit obligations were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets and were amortized into earnings over the remaining service life of participants to the extent that the amounts were in excess of a corridor under the new policy actuarial gains and losses will be recognized immediately in our consolidated statements of earnings as of the measurement date which is our fiscal year end or more frequently if an interim remeasurement is required in addition we no longer use a marketrelated value of plan assets which is an average value to determine the expected return on assets but rather will use the fair value of plan assets we believe the new policies will provide greater transparency to ongoing operating results and better reflect the impact of current market conditions on the obligations and assets 

relevant financial information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the changes in segment reporting and accounting policy 

executive summary 

we are a manufacturer and marketer of highquality branded food and beverage products 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and experience global competition for all of our principal products the principal areas of competition are brand recognition taste quality price advertising promotion convenience and service to grow and maintain our market positions we focus on bringing new products and innovations to market that meet evolving consumer needs and preferences while maintaining the quality and appeal of our existing products we continue to optimize our manufacturing 

14   

and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development advertising marketing and consumer promotions 

over the last several years we have diversified our product offerings through several acquisitions and enhanced our focus through a divestiture in 2013 we acquired bolthouse farms and plum in 2014 we acquired kelsen and divested our european simple meals business in 2015 we completed the acquisition of the assets of garden fresh gourmet see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our recent acquisitions and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our divestiture of the european simple meals business 

industry trends 

our businesses are being influenced by a variety of trends that we anticipate will continue in the future including changing demographics consumer tastes opinions and behaviors millennials and generation z are replacing baby boomers as the key influencers of societal and cultural norms in the us in addition there is a leveling or shrinking middle class in developed markets while there is a growing middle class in developing markets 

consumers increasingly seek products that they deem healthy including fresh organic and functional foods while demanding products with these qualities consumers have become more distrustful of large corporations and other large institutions traditional retailers are responding by developing small format and neighborhood stores and expanding shelf space for purposedriven brands consumers also continue to gravitate toward value offerings which is demonstrated by the increase in lowerpriced retailers such as dollar stores and the growth of privatelabel offerings 

digital technology is changing the way consumers purchase food although ecommerce represents only a small percent of total food sales today we anticipate it will accelerate rapidly through the growth of pureplay etailers increased focus of brick and mortar retailers on ecommerce and the mainstreaming of meal delivery services consumers are also increasingly using digital technology to customize their diets for their individual lifestyle physiology and health goals 

key strategies 

our longterm goal is to build shareholder value by driving sustainable profitable net sales growth guided by our purpose  real food that matters for life’s moments  we are pursuing a dual strategy of strengthening our core businesses while expanding into fastergrowing spaces 

new structure 

in 2016 we implemented a new enterprise design that better aligns with our dual strategy under the new structure our divisions are now organized in three segments focused mainly on product categories americas simple meals and beverages global biscuits and snacks and campbell fresh in support of our new structure we designed and implemented a new integrated global services igs organization to deliver shared services and cost savings across the company we are also pursuing other initiatives to reduce costs such as adopting zerobased budgeting over time in total we expect our cost savings initiatives to generate approximately 300 million in annual cost savings by the end of fiscal 2018 these savings are above and beyond our existing supplychain productivity initiatives we expect to reinvest a portion of these savings into the businesses during 2017 see restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives for additional information on these initiatives 

strategic imperatives 

with this new enterprise design in place we are responding to the abovedescribed industry trends by continuing to focus on four key strategic imperatives 

 elevating trust through real food transparency and sustainability 

our focus is to strengthen the trust of our consumers and customers that our products are real food made with desirable ingredients and crafted using ethical sourcing and sustainable practices we continue to do this by changing recipes or removing ingredients from our food such as artificial flavors and colors our wwwwhatsinmyfoodcom website promotes transparency by providing consumers with a wide range of details about how many of our foods and beverages are made and the choices behind the ingredients we use in those products this site includes all of our major products in the us and canada with designs to expand globally over the next two fiscal years in addition we support and remain committed to mandatory national genetically modified organism labeling 

15   

building digital marketing and ecommerce 

we are responding to the growing consumer shift to digital and mobile technologies by focusing a larger percentage of our marketing efforts on digital marketing and ecommerce we believe these efforts will position us well to grow with the expanding ecommerce market although we are shifting our marketing efforts to digital and mobile platforms we continue to pursue a multichannel approach to ensure our products are available to consumers at traditional storefront retailers as well as online retailers 

diversifying our portfolio in health and wellbeing 

capitalizing on recent consumer and retailer trends in health and wellbeing we are increasing our focus on fresh and healthy foods we plan to expand our product offerings in key growth areas such as in the packaged fresh category and with organic and clean label products in addition we will focus on naturally functional foods by leveraging our vegetable and whole grain capabilities 

expanding presence in developing markets over time 

we plan to focus on expanding our presence in developing markets especially our global biscuits and snacks business in asia we will aim to increase the household penetration and frequency of purchase of our iconic brands goldfish  kjeldsens  and tim tam  in their home markets while expanding into new geographies 

to support these four imperatives we will continue to pursue different models of innovation including smart external development disciplined mergers and acquisitions strategic partnerships and venture investing

corporate in 2014  included a 31 million  loss associated with pension and postretirement benefit marktomarket adjustments a 9 million  loss on foreign exchange forward contracts related to the sale of the european simple meals business and 3 million of restructuringrelated costs the remaining decrease was primarily due to a reduction in pension and postretirement benefit interest cost net of expected return on assets and lower losses on open commodity hedges in 2015 

interest expenseincome 

interest expense increased  to 115 million  in 2016  from 108 million  in 2015  reflecting higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio partially offset by lower average levels of debt 

interest expense decreased  to 108 million  in 2015  from 122 million  in 2014  reflecting lower average levels of debt 

taxes on earnings 

the effective tax rate was 337  in 2016  298  in 2015  and 326  in 2014  

in 2016 we recognized a tax benefit of 113 million on 313 million of pension and postretirement benefit marktomarket losses a 29 million tax benefit on 78 million of restructuring charges implementation costs and other related costs and a 14 million tax benefit on the 141 million impairment charge on the trademark and goodwill associated with the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit in 2016 the 25 million gain from a settlement of a claim related to the kelsen acquisition was not subject to tax in 2015 we recognized a tax benefit of 51 million on 138 million of pension and postretirement benefit marktomarket losses and a 46 million tax benefit on 124 million of restructuring charges and implementation costs after adjusting for the items above the remaining increase in the effective tax rate in 2016 was primarily due to lapping the favorable resolution of an intercompany pricing agreement between the us and canada in 2015

restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives 

2015 initiatives 

on january 29 2015 we announced plans to implement a new enterprise design focused mainly on product categories under the new structure which we fully implemented at the beginning of 2016 our businesses are organized in the following divisions americas simple meals and beverages global biscuits and snacks and campbell fresh 

in support of the new structure we designed and implemented a new igs organization to deliver shared services across the company we also streamlined our organizational structure we are pursuing other initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness such as adopting zerobased budgeting over time 

as part of these initiatives we commenced a voluntary employee separation program available to certain usbased salaried employees nearing retirement who met age lengthofservice and business unitfunction criteria a total of 471  employees elected the program the electing employees remained with us through at least july 31 2015 with some remaining beyond july 31 we also implemented an initiative to reduce overhead across the organization by eliminating approximately 250  positions in 2016 we recorded a restructuring charge of 35 million  related to these initiatives in 2015 we recorded a restructuring charge of 102 million  related to these initiatives 

22   

in 2016 we also incurred charges of 47 million  recorded in administrative expenses related to the implementation of the new organizational structure and cost savings initiatives in 2015 we incurred charges of 22 million  recorded in administrative expenses related to these initiatives 

the aggregate aftertax impact of restructuring charges implementation costs and other related costs recorded in 2016 was 52 million  or 017  per share the aggregate aftertax impact of restructuring charges and implementation and other costs recorded in 2015 was 78 million  or 25  per share a summary of the pretax costs associated with the 2015 initiatives is as follows 



the total estimated pretax costs for the 2015 initiatives are approximately 250 million  to 300 million  we expect the costs to consist of approximately 135 million  to 145 million  in severance pay and benefits and approximately 115 million  to 155 million  in implementation costs and other related costswe expect the total pretax costs related to the 2015 initiatives will be associated with segments as follows americas simple meals and beverages  approximately 30  global biscuits and snacks  approximately 32  campbell fresh  approximately 3  and corporate  approximately 35  

we expect substantially all costs to be cash expenditures except for 7 million of noncash postretirement and pension curtailment costs incurred in 2015 we expect to incur the costs through 2018 and to fund the costs through cash flows from operations and shortterm borrowings 

we expect the 2015 initiatives to generate pretax savings of approximately 265 million in 2017 and once fully implemented annual ongoing savings of approximately 300 million beginning in 2018 in 2016 and 2015 pretax savings were 215 million and 85 million respectively 

segment operating results do not include restructuring charges implementation costs and other related costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges a summary of the pretax costs incurred to date associated with segments is as follows

liquidity and capital resources 

we expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations longterm borrowings shortterm borrowings including commercial paper credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents we believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements 

we generated cash flows from operations of 1463 billion in 2016  compared to 1182 billion  in 2015  the increase  in 2016  was primarily due to higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements primarily inventories 

we generated cash flows from operations of 1182 billion in 2015  compared to 899 million  in 2014  the increase  in 2015  was primarily due to lower working capital requirements taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the european simple meals business and lower pension contributions in 2015 partially offset by lower cash earnings 

current assets are less than current liabilities as a result of our level of current maturities of longterm debt and shortterm borrowings and our focus to lower core working capital requirements by reducing trade receivables and inventories while extending payment terms for accounts payables we had negative working capital of 647 million  as of july 31 2016 and 713 million  as of august 2 2015 debt maturing within one year was 1219 billion  as of july 31 2016 and 1543 billion  as of august 2 2015

inflation 

we are exposed to the impact of inflation on our cost of products sold we use a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation including increasing prices commodity hedging and pursuing cost productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies and capital investments that improve the efficiency of operations 

market risk sensitivity 

the principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices in addition we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variablerate and fixedrate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variabletototal debt ratio within targeted guidelines international operations which accounted for 19 of 2016  net sales are concentrated principally in australia and canada we manage our foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing crosscurrency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts we enter into crosscurrency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments 

we principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short and longterm supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials including certain commodities and agricultural products we also enter into commodity futures options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of wheat diesel fuel aluminum soybean oil cocoa natural gas butter corn and cheese which impact the cost of raw materials

crosscurrency swaps 

we did not have any crosscurrency swap contracts outstanding as of july 31 2016 the crosscurrency swap contracts outstanding as of august 2 2015  represented one pay variable audreceive variable usd swap with a notional value totaling 31 million and four pay variable cadreceive variable usd swaps with notional values totaling 219 million the aggregate notional value of these swap contracts was 250 million as of august 2 2015  and the aggregate fair value of these swap contracts was a gain of 40 million as of august 2 2015  

we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries including subsidiary debt we utilize foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures the following table summarizes the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related weightedaverage contract exchange rates as of july 31 2016

significant accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions 

trade and consumer promotion programs — we offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers such as feature price discounts instore display incentives cooperative advertising programs new product introduction fees and coupons the mix between promotion programs which are classified as reductions in revenue and advertising or other marketing activities which are classified as marketing and selling expenses fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues the measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors typically programs that are offered have a very short duration historically the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements however actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates 

valuation of longlived assets — fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if impairment exists if impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value 

goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a twostep quantitative test the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill we may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a twostep quantitative impairment test fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value goodwill is considered impaired the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the “implied” fair value which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination 

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates weighted average cost of capital and assumed royalty rates if the fair value is less than the carrying value the asset is reduced to fair value 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 as part of our annual review of goodwill and intangible assets we recognized an impairment charge of 106 million  on goodwill and 35 million  on a trademark within the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit which is part of the campbell fresh segment in 2016 carrot performance primarily reflected the adverse impact of weather conditions on crop yields and execution issues in response to those conditions which led to customer dissatisfaction a loss of business and higher carrot costs in the second half of the year these factors resulted in a decline in profitability during the second half of the year which was below our expectations although we expect sales and margins to improve over time after this weak performance we revised our 2017 outlook and longterm expectations in the fourth quarter the impairment was attributable to this revised future outlook for the business with reduced expectations for sales margins and discounted cash flows 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 as part of our annual review of intangible assets we recognized an impairment charge of 6 million  on minor trademarks used in the global biscuits and snacks segment the trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows 

the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance economic conditions market conditions and cost of capital inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control such as capital markets the actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions 

as of july 31 2016  the carrying value of goodwill was 2263 billion  of which 202 million relates to the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit the carrying value of the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit represents fair value as a result of the impairment charge in 2016 in addition we acquired garden fresh gourmet on june 29 2015 and therefore the fair value is not significantly in excess of the carrying value as of july 31 2016  goodwill related to 

29   

garden fresh gourmet was 116 million  as of the 2016  measurement excluding the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit and garden fresh gourmet the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by at least 25 holding all other assumptions used in the 2016  fair value measurement constant a 100basispoint increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit other than the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit and garden fresh gourmet to be in excess of the fair value the fair value was based on significant management assumptions if assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline potential impairment charges could result 

as of july 31 2016  the carrying value of indefinitelived trademarks was 927 million  of which 68 million relates to the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit holding all other assumptions used in the 2016 measurement constant a 100basispoint increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of trademarks and result in an impairment charge of approximately 30 million 

see also note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets 

pension and postretirement benefits — we provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care trend rates independent actuaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states perform the required calculations to determine expense 

the discount rate is established as of our fiscal yearend measurement date in establishing the discount rate we review published market indices of highquality debt securities adjusted as appropriate for duration in addition independent actuaries apply highquality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans the expected return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering our current and projected investment mix this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation longterm projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date 

net periodic pension and postretirement expense was 317 million  in 2016  125 million  in 2015  and 58 million  in 2014  

significant weightedaverage assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows 



estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows a 50basispoint decline in the discount rate would decrease expense by approximately 6 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of approximately 180 million a 50basispoint reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 10 million a onepercentagepoint increase in assumed health care costs would have no impact on postretirement service and interest cost and would result in an immediate loss recognition of 12 million 

no contributions were made to us pension plans in 2016  and 2015  we contributed 35 million  to us pension plans in 2014  contributions to nonus plans were 2 million  in 2016  5 million  in 2015  and 12 million  in 2014  we do not expect to contribute to the us pension plans in 2017 contributions to nonus plans are expected to be approximately 5 million  in 2017 

see also note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement benefits 

income taxes — the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized

ingredients and packaging 

the ingredient and packaging materials required for the manufacture of our food products are purchased from various suppliers these items are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors including changes in crop size cattle cycles disease product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations governmentsponsored agricultural programs import and export requirements drought and other weather conditions including the potential effects of climate change during the growing and harvesting seasons to help reduce some of this price volatility we use a combination of purchase orders short and longterm contracts inventory management practices and various commodity risk management tools for most of our ingredients and packaging ingredient inventories are at a peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only at certain seasons we make commitments for the purchase of such ingredients during their respective seasons at this time we do not anticipate any material restrictions on the availability of ingredients or packaging that would have a significant impact on our businesses for information on the impact of inflation see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

customers 

in most of our markets sales and merchandising activities are conducted through our own sales force and our thirdparty broker and distributor partners in the us canada and latin america our products are generally resold to consumers in retail food chains mass discounters mass merchandisers club stores convenience stores drug stores dollar stores and other retail commercial and noncommercial establishments in the asia pacific region our products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains convenience stores and other retail commercial and noncommercial establishments we make shipments promptly after receipt and acceptance of orders 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 38  of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2015 35  in 2014 and 36  in 2013 our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 20  of our consolidated net sales in 2015 and 19  in 2014 and 2013 all of our reportable segments sold products to walmart stores inc or its affiliates no other customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

trademarks and technology 

as of september 15  2015 we owned over 3700 trademark registrations and applications in over 160 countries we believe our trademarks are of material importance to our business although the laws vary by jurisdiction trademarks generally are valid as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to have become generic trademark registrations generally can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use we believe that our principal brands including arnotts bolthouse farms campbells garden fresh gourmet goldfish kjeldsens pace pepperidge farm plum prego swanson and  v8 are protected by trademark law in the major markets where they are used in addition some of our products are sold under brands that have been licensed from third parties 

although we own a number of valuable patents we do not regard any segment of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents in addition we own copyrights both registered and unregistered and proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

4   

competition 

we experience worldwide competition in all of our principal products this competition arises from numerous competitors of varying sizes across multiple food and beverage categories and includes producers of generic and private label products as well as other branded food and beverage manufacturers all of these competitors vie for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars the number of competitors cannot be reliably estimated the principal areas of competition are brand recognition taste quality price advertising promotion convenience and service 

working capital 

for information relating to our cash and working capital items see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

capital expenditures 

during 2015 our aggregate capital expenditures were 380 million  we expect to spend approximately 350 million  for capital projects in 2016 major 2016 capital projects include an ongoing bolthouse farms beverage and salad dressing capacity expansion project an ongoing north american warehouse capacity expansion project a new australian multipack biscuit capacity expansion project and a new refrigeration replacement project at our virginia australia plant 

research and development 

during the last three fiscal years our expenditures on research and development activities relating to new products and the improvement and maintenance of existing products were 113 million  in 2015 121 million  in 2014 and 128 million  in 2013 the decrease from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to savings from cost reduction and restructuring initiatives the decrease from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs and cost savings from restructuring initiatives partially offset by the impact of acquisitions 

environmental matters 

we have requirements for the operation and design of our facilities that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations of our 380 million  in capital expenditures made during 2015 approximately 12 million was for compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the us we further estimate that approximately 10 million of the capital expenditures anticipated during 2016 will be for compliance with us environmental laws and regulations we believe that continued compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations both within the us and elsewhere will not have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position in addition we continue to monitor existing and pending environmental laws and regulations within the us and elsewhere including the recentlyenacted regulations in the us to limit carbon dioxide emissions from electric utilities relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions while the impact of these laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

seasonality 

demand for our products is somewhat seasonal with the fall and winter months usually accounting for the highest sales volume due primarily to demand for our soup products sales of kelsen products are also highest in the fall and winter months due primarily to holiday gift giving demand for our other products is generally evenly distributed throughout the year 

employees 

on august 2 2015  we had approximately 18600 employees

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in the highly competitive food industry and experience international competition in all of our principal products the principal areas of competition are brand recognition taste quality price advertising promotion convenience and service a number of our primary competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources a strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts or a consumer shift towards private label offerings could result in us reducing pricing increasing marketing or other expenditures andor losing market share 

our results are dependent on strengthening our core businesses while diversifying into fastergrowing spaces 

 our strategy is focused on strengthening our core businesses while diversifying our portfolio into fastergrowing spaces our core businesses are concentrated in slowergrowing centerstore categories in traditional mass and grocery channels factors that may impact our success include 

• our ability to identify and capitalize on fastergrowing spaces 

 • our ability to design and implement effective retail execution plans 

• our ability to design and implement effective advertising and marketing programs including digital programs 

• our ability to secure or maintain sufficient shelf space at retailers and 

• changes in underlying growth rates of the categories in which we compete 

if we are not successful in addressing theses factors our strategy may not be successful andor our business or financial results may be negatively impacted 

we may not realize anticipated benefits from our cost reduction organizational design or other initiatives 

we recently implemented a new enterprise design focused mainly on product categories we are also pursuing related initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness such as streamlining our organization and adopting zerobased budgeting over time the success of these initiatives presents significant organizational challenges and in some cases may require extensive negotiations with third parties such as suppliers and other business partners as a result we may not realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits from the initiatives other events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays or unexpected costs may also adversely impact our ability to realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits or cause us not to realize the anticipated cost savings or other benefits on the expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated cost savings our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected in addition the initiatives may not advance our strategy as expected finally the complexity of the initiatives will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from other business issues have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale 

from timetotime we may also implement other supply chain information technology or related initiatives our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from these additional initiatives which are often complex 

any failure to implement our cost reduction organizational design or other initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business or financial results 

our results may be adversely affected by the failure to execute acquisitions and divestitures successfully 

our ability to meet our objectives with respect to the acquisition of new businesses or the divestiture of existing businesses may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers and sellers negotiate favorable financial terms and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals potential risks of acquisitions also include 

• the inability to integrate acquired businesses efficiently into our existing operations 

• diversion of managements attention from other business concerns 

• potential loss of key employees andor customers of acquired businesses 

6   

• potential assumption of unknown liabilities 

• the inability to implement promptly an effective control environment 

• potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline and 

• the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience 

acquisitions outside the us may present unique challenges and increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes for divestitures potential risks may also include the inability to separate divested businesses or business units from us effectively and efficiently and to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs our business or financial results may be negatively affected if acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed 

disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to manufacture andor sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities or to the capabilities of our suppliers or contract manufacturers due to factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as adverse weather conditions natural disasters fire terrorism pandemics strikes or other events production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought water scarcity temperature extremes scarcity of suitable agricultural land crop disease andor crop pests failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur may adversely affect our business or financial results particularly in circumstances where a product is sourced from a single supplier or location disputes with significant suppliers or contract manufacturers including disputes regarding pricing or performance may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture andor sell our products as well as our business or financial results 

our nonus operations pose additional risks to our business 

in 2015 approximately 21 of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations were generated outside of the us sales outside the us are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of consolidated net sales our business or financial performance may be adversely affected due to the risks of doing business in markets outside of the us including but not limited to the following 

• unfavorable changes in tariffs quotas trade barriers or other export and import restrictions 

 in addition we hold assets and incur liabilities generate revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the australian dollar and the canadian dollar our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars and we must translate our assets liabilities sales and expenses into us dollars for external reporting purposes as a result changes in the value of the us dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their local currency 

we face risks related to recession financial and credit market disruptions   and other economic conditions 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions recession equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the us or other nations similarly disruptions in financial andor credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers suppliers and creditors in addition changes in tax or interest rates in the us or other nations whether due to recession financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons could impact us 

increased regulation or regulatorybased claims could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated the primary areas of regulation include the processing packaging storage distribution marketing advertising labeling quality and safety of our food products as well as 

7   

the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment in the us we are subject to regulation by various government agencies including the food and drug administration the us department of agriculture the federal trade commission the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies we are also regulated by similar agencies outside the us changes in regulatory requirements such as proposed labeling requirements or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance cost capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results in addition the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal state and foreign laws or regulations legal proceedings or claims related to our marketing could damage our reputation andor could adversely affect our business or financial results 

our results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and   packaging materials 

the raw and packaging materials used in our business include tomato paste grains beef poultry vegetables steel glass paper and resin many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including crop size cattle cycles disease product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations governmentsponsored agricultural programs import and export requirements drought and other weather conditions including the potential effects of climate change to the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and packaging material prices we may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases or through our commodity hedging activity 

adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operations 

our business or financial results could be adversely affected by changing global temperatures or weather patterns or by extreme or unusual weather conditions adverse changes in the global climate or extreme or unusual weather conditions could 

 in addition there is growing concern that the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere may be impacting global temperatures and weather patterns and contributing to extreme or unusual weather conditions this growing concern may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases adoption of such additional regulation may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

price increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs or may result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in the marketplace 

we intend to pass along to customers some or all cost increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs through increases in the selling prices of or decreases in the packaging sizes of some of our products higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume to the extent the price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset increased raw and packaging materials and other input costs andor if they result in significant decreases in sales volume our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customers 

our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade in recent years alternative retail grocery channels such as dollar stores drug stores club stores and internetbased retailers have increased their market share this trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future if we are not successful in pursuing our strategy to expand sales in alternative retail grocery channels our business or financial results may be adversely impacted in addition consolidations in the traditional retail grocery trade have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek lower prices increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers or more favorable terms these customers may use more of their shelf space for their private label products if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics our business or financial results could be negatively impacted 

in 2015 our five largest customers accounted for approximately 38  of our consolidated net sales with the largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounting for approximately 20  of our consolidated net sales disruption of sales to any of these customers or to any of our other large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results 

8   

if our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled we might need to recall those items and we may experience product liability claims if   consumers are injured 

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury to consumers a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment a significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety andor quality of our products ingredients or packaging such a loss of confidence could occur even in the absence of a recall or a major product liability claim 

we may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in or security breaches of our   information technology systems 

our information technology systems are critically important to our operations we rely on our information technology systems some of which are outsourced to third parties to manage the data communications and business processes for all of our functions including our marketing sales manufacturing logistics customer service accounting and administrative functions if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure our business or financial results could be negatively impacted furthermore our information technology systems may be vulnerable to material security breaches including the access to or acquisition of customer consumer or other confidential data cyberbased attacks or other material system failures if we are unable to prevent material failures our operations may be impacted and we may suffer other negative consequences such as reputational damage litigation remediation costs andor penalties under various data privacy laws and regulations 

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products packaging andor ingredients whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our results could be negatively impacted 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our financial results and net worth   

as of august 2 2015 we had goodwill of 23 billion and other indefinitelived intangible assets of 960 million goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise we test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including goodwill to the units fair value similarly we test indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values fair value for both goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis if the carrying values of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets exceed their fair value the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair value factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our financial results and net worth 

we may be adversely impacted by legal proceedings or claims 

we are party to a variety of legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business since litigation is inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such proceedings or claims or that our assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection with such matters will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims in addition our reputation could be damaged by allegations made in legal proceeding or claims even if untrue in the event we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against these proceedings or claims or if our assessment of the materiality of these proceedings or claims proves inaccurate our business or financial results may be adversely affected 

we may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to   our defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for employees in the us and various nonus locations the major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets investment returns interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future 

9   

funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

key strategies 

our longterm goal is to build shareholder value by driving sustainable profitable net sales growth guided by our purpose  “real food that matters for life’s moments” we expect to deliver this goal by executing against a dual strategy of strengthening our core businesses while also expanding into fastergrowing spaces 

new enterprise design 

we recently implemented a new enterprise design that better aligns with our dual strategy under the new design which we fully implemented at the beginning of 2016 our businesses are now organized in three divisions focused mainly on product categories each division also has a defined portfolio role the new divisions and their portfolio roles are 

 in support of our new enterprise design we designed and implemented a new integrated global services igs organization to deliver shared services across the company igs became effective at the beginning of 2016 and is a key element in our efforts to reduce costs while also increasing our efficiency and effectiveness we are also pursuing other initiatives to reduce costs such as streamlining our organizational structure and adopting zerobased budgeting over time in total we expect the new igs organization and our other cost savings initiatives to generate approximately 250 million in annual cost savings by the end of fiscal 2018 these savings are above and beyond our existing enabler program see restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives for additional information on these initiatives 

dual strategy 

with this new enterprise design in place we plan to pursue our dual strategy by

providing greater product transparency 

on our wwwwhatsinmyfoodcom  website we are providing consumers with a wide range of detail about how some of our foods and beverages are made and the choices behind the ingredients we use in those products initially focused on some of our top us products such as campbell’s  condensed tomato and chicken noodle soups we plan to expand this site to include all of our major products in the us and canada in 2016 with designs to expand globally over the next three fiscal years we anticipate this enhanced transparency will lead to or accelerate changes in our products including our continued efforts to remove many artificial ingredients where feasible 

embracing digital marketing and ecommerce 

we plan to complement the growing consumer shift to digital and mobile technologies by focusing a larger percentage of our marketing efforts on digital marketing and ecommerce for example in 2016 we expect to spend a larger portion of our overall media budget on digital media while reducing our spending on traditional television media we also plan to continue our focus on ecommerce capabilities in 2016 

increasing focus on health and wellbeing 

capitalizing on recent consumer and retailer trends towards fresh andor healthy products we plan to increase our focus on our fresh and packaged fresh products while other parts of our business will continue to provide shelfstable products that are appealing to healthconscious consumers our new campbell fresh division has a diverse portfolio of fresh and packaged fresh offerings that should help retailers attract these important customers we expect the campbell fresh division to provide us with the needed scale to better compete in the growing perimeter of traditional retail outlets the recent acquisition of garden fresh gourmet which provides refrigerated salsa hummus and dips as well as tortilla chips compliments campbell fresh’s existing portfolio 

expanding presence in developing markets 

in 2016 we plan to continue to focus on expanding our presence in developing markets especially our global biscuits and snacks business in asia our new enterprise design unifies all of our biscuit and snacks brands under a single integrated division  global biscuits and snacks we expect this new structure to help unlock the value of our biscuit and snack brands and to provide a platform to extend these brands across both faster growing developing markets as well as our existing developed markets 

to support these four imperatives we will continue to evaluate external development opportunities ranging from acquisitions to strategic alliances such as joint ventures and other strategic partnerships

inflation 

in 2015 inflation in cost of products sold was higher than 2014 and 2014 was higher than 2013 we continue to use a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation including increasing prices commodity hedging and pursuing cost productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies and capital investments that improve the efficiency of operations 

market risk sensitivity 

the principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices in addition we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variablerate and fixedrate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variabletototal debt ratio within targeted guidelines international operations which accounted for 21 of 2015  net sales are concentrated principally in australia and canada we manage our foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts we enter into crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures we do not enter into contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments 

we principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short and longterm supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials including certain commodities and agricultural products we also enter into commodity futures options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of diesel fuel wheat soybean oil aluminum natural gas cocoa butter corn and cheese which impact the cost of raw materials 

the information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of august 2 2015  fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 13 through 15 to the consolidated financial statements

we enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of our capital stock the total return of the vanguard institutional index and the total return of the vanguard total international stock index under these contracts we pay variable interest rates and receive from the counterparty either the total return on our capital stock the total return of the standard  poors 500 index which is expected to approximate the total return of the vanguard institutional index or the total return of the ishares msci eafe index which is expected to approximate the total return of the vanguard total international stock index the notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return on our capital stock was 17 million  at august 2 2015  and 25 million  at august 3 2014  the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract which expires in april 2016  was 080  at august 2 2015  the notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the standard  poors 500 index was 24 million  at august 2 2015  and 22 million  at august 3 2014  the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract which expires in march 2016  was 079  at august 2 2015  the notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return of the ishares msci eafe index was 8 million  at august 2 2015  and 9 million  at august 3 2014  the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract which expires in march 2016  was 071  at august 2 2015  the fair value of these contracts was a 1 million   gain  at august 2 2015  and a 3 million   loss  at august 3 2014  

our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations debt repayment and debt issuances market effects on debt and foreign currency and our acquisition and divestiture activities 

significant accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions 

trade and consumer promotion programs — we offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers such as feature price discounts instore display incentives cooperative advertising programs new product introduction fees and coupons the mix between promotion programs which are classified as reductions in revenue and advertising or other marketing activities which are classified as marketing and selling expenses fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues the measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors typically programs that are offered have a very short duration historically the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements however actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates 

valuation of longlived assets — fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow 

29   

analyses are used to determine if impairment exists if impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value 

goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a twostep quantitative test the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill we may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a twostep quantitative impairment test fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value goodwill is considered impaired the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the “implied” fair value which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination 

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates weighted average cost of capital and assumed royalty rates if the fair value is less than the carrying value the asset is reduced to fair value 

as of august 2 2015  the carrying value of goodwill was 2344 million  recent acquisitions include garden fresh gourmet on june 29 2015 kelsen in 2014 and plum and bolthouse farms in 2013 as of august 2 2015  goodwill related to the acquisitions was as follows garden fresh gourmet  116 million  kelsen  115 million plum  128 million  and bolthouse farms  692 million  as of the 2015 measurement the estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value excluding the recent acquisitions holding all other assumptions used in the 2015 fair value measurement constant a 100basispoint increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit excluding the recent acquisitions to be in excess of the fair value because the garden fresh gourmet acquisition closed on june 29 2015 the carrying value represents fair value with respect to the 2013 and 2014 acquisitions the fair value exceeded the carrying value by at least 7 and as a result holding all other assumptions used in the 2015 fair value measurement constant a 100basispoint increase in the weighted average cost of capital would result in the carrying value to be in excess of the fair value the fair value was based on significant management assumptions if assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline potential impairment charges could result 

as of august 2 2015  the carrying value of indefinitelived trademarks was 960 million  as of august 2 2015  trademarks related to the acquisitions in 2013 through 2015 were as follows garden fresh gourmet  38 million  kelsen  120 million plum  115 million and bolthouse farms  383 million excluding the garden fresh gourmet trademark acquired on june 29 2015 holding all other assumptions used in the 2015 measurement constant a 100basispoint increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of trademarks and result in an impairment charge of approximately 20 million 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 as part of our annual review of intangible assets we recognized an impairment charge of 6 million  on minor trademarks used in the global baking and snacking segment the trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows in comparison to the prior year 

in the fourth quarter of 2013 as part of our annual review of intangible assets we recorded an impairment charge of 360 million  on goodwill and 36 million  on trademarks for the simple meals business in europe the impairment was attributable to a combination of factors including the existence of a firm offer to purchase the business a revised future outlook for the business with reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows given the economic uncertainty in the region future investments required to maintain performance and managements assumptions on the weighted average cost of capital on october 28 2013 we completed the sale of our european simple meals business we have reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings the business was historically included in the international simple meals and beverages segment see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on discontinued operations 

the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance economic conditions market conditions and cost of capital inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control such as capital markets the actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions 

see also note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets 

pension and postretirement benefits — we provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected 

30   

return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care trend rates independent actuaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states perform the required calculations to determine expense actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods 

the discount rate is established as of our fiscal yearend measurement date in establishing the discount rate we review published market indices of highquality debt securities adjusted as appropriate for duration in addition independent actuaries apply highquality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans the expected return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering our current and projected investment mix this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation longterm projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets the value of plan assets used in the calculation of pension expense is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20 of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date if the net gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year 

net periodic pension and postretirement expense was 80 million  in 2015 109 million  in 2014 and 130 million  in 2013 

significant weightedaverage assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows 



estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows a 50basispoint reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 14 million a 50basispoint reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 11 million a onepercentagepoint increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately 1 million  

no contributions were made to us pension plans in 2015 we contributed 35 million  and 75 million  respectively to us pension plans in 2014 and 2013 contributions to nonus plans were 5 million  in 2015 and 12 million  in 2014 and 2013 we do not expect to contribute to the us pension plans in 2016 contributions to nonus plans are expected to be approximately 5 million  in 2016 

see also note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement expenses 

income taxes — the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized

• changes in underlying growth rates of the categories in which the company competes 

if the company is not successful in addressing theses factors the companys strategy may not be successful andor the companys business or financial results may be negatively impacted 

the companys results may be adversely affected by the failure to execute acquisitions and divestitures successfully 

the companys ability to meet its objectives with respect to the acquisition of new businesses or the divestiture of existing businesses may depend in part on its ability to identify suitable buyers and sellers negotiate favorable financial terms and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals potential risks of acquisitions also include

acquisitions outside the us may present unique challenges and increase the companys exposure to risks associated with foreign operations including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes for divestitures potential risks may also include the inability to separate divested businesses or business units from the company effectively and efficiently and to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs the companys business or financial results may be negatively affected if acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed 

disruption to the companys supply chain could adversely affect its business

6   

the companys nonus operations pose additional risks to the companys business 

in 2014 approximately 22 of the companys consolidated net sales from continuing operations were generated outside of the us sales outside the us are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of consolidated net sales the companys business or financial performance may be adversely affected due to the risks of doing business in markets outside of the us including but not limited to the following 

• unfavorable changes in tariffs quotas trade barriers or other export and import restrictions 

 in addition the company holds assets and incurs liabilities generates revenue and pays expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the australian dollar and the canadian dollar the companys consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars and the company must translate its assets liabilities sales and expenses into us dollars for external reporting purposes as a result changes in the value of the us dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in the companys consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their local currency 

the company faces risks related to recession financial and credit market disruptions   and other economic conditions 

customer and consumer demand for the companys products may be impacted by weak economic conditions recession equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the us or other nations similarly disruptions in financial andor credit markets may impact the companys ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its customers suppliers and creditors in addition changes in tax or interest rates in the us or other nations whether due to recession financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons could impact the company 

increased regulation or regulatorybased claims could adversely affect the companys business or financial results 

the manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated the primary areas of regulation include the processing packaging storage distribution marketing advertising labeling quality and safety of the companys food products as well as the health and safety of the companys employees and the protection of the environment in the us the company is subject to regulation by various government agencies including the food and drug administration the us department of agriculture the federal trade commission the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies the company is also regulated by similar agencies outside the us changes in regulatory requirements such as proposed labeling requirements or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance cost capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect the companys business or financial results in addition the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal state and foreign laws or regulations legal proceedings or claims related to the companys marketing could damage the companys reputation andor could adversely affect the companys business or financial results 

the companys results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and   packaging materials 

the raw and packaging materials used in the companys business include tomato paste grains beef poultry vegetables steel glass paper and resin many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations weather conditions import and export requirements and changes in governmentsponsored agricultural programs to the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and packaging material prices the company may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases or through its commodity hedging activity 

7   

adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect the companys business or operations 

the companys business or financial results could be adversely affected by changing global temperatures or weather patterns or by extreme or unusual weather conditions adverse changes in the global climate or extreme or unusual weather conditions could 

 in addition there is growing concern that the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere may be impacting global temperatures and weather patterns and contributing to extreme or unusual weather conditions this growing concern may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases adoption of such additional regulation may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect the companys business or financial results 

price increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs or may result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in the marketplace 

the company intends to pass along to customers some or all cost increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs through increases in the selling prices of or decreases in the packaging sizes of some of its products higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume to the extent the price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset increased raw and packaging materials and other input costs andor if they result in significant decreases in sales volume the companys business results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the company may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of its customers 

the companys businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade in recent years alternative retail grocery channels such as dollar stores drug stores club stores and internetbased retailers have increased their market share this trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future if the company is not successful in pursuing its strategy to expand sales in alternative retail grocery channels its business or financial results may be adversely impacted in addition consolidations in the traditional retail grocery trade have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek lower prices or increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers these customers may use more of their shelf space for their private label products if the company is unable to use its scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics the companys business or financial results could be negatively impacted 

in 2014 the companys five largest customers accounted for approximately 35  of the companys consolidated net sales with the largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounting for approximately 19  of the companys consolidated net sales disruption of sales to any of these customers or to any of the companys other large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect the companys business or financial results

the company may need to recall some of its products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled and may also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes injury to consumers a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time the company could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment a significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity damage to the companys reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety andor quality of its products ingredients or packaging such a loss of confidence could occur even in the absence of a recall or a major product liability claim 

8   

the company may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in or security breaches of its   information technology systems 

the companys information technology systems are critically important to the companys operations the company relies on its information technology systems some of which are outsourced to third parties to manage the data communications and business processes for all of its functions including its marketing sales manufacturing logistics customer service accounting and administrative functions if the company does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure the companys business or financial results could be negatively impacted furthermore the companys information technology systems may be vulnerable to material security breaches including the access to or acquisition of customer consumer or other confidential data cyberbased attacks or other material system failures if the company is unable to prevent material failures the companys operations may be impacted and the company may suffer other negative consequences such as reputational damage litigation remediation costs andor penalties under various data privacy laws and regulations 

the companys results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of its brands 

the company has a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of the companys business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on the companys ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that the company has acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about the companys products packaging andor ingredients whether or not valid the companys failure to maintain the quality of its products the failure of the companys products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about the company its brands products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage the companys brands and reputation if the company does not maintain the favorable perception of its brands the companys results could be negatively impacted 

the company may not properly execute or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits   from its ongoing supply chain information technology or other initiatives 

the companys success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from its ongoing supply chain information technology and other initiatives these initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient which is necessary in the companys highly competitive industry these initiatives are often complex and a failure to implement them properly may in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits result in an interruption to the companys sales manufacturing logistics customer service or accounting functions 

the company may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to   its defined benefit pension plans 

the company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans for employees in the us and various nonus locations the major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets investment returns interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of the companys defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet a significant increase in the companys obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company

significant accounting estimates 

the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions 

trade and consumer promotion programs — the company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers such as feature price discounts instore display incentives cooperative advertising programs new product introduction fees and coupons the mix between promotion programs which are classified as reductions in revenue and advertising or other marketing activities which are classified as marketing and selling expenses fluctuates between periods based on the company’s overall marketing plans and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues the measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors typically programs that are offered have a very short duration historically the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements however actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates 

valuation of longlived assets — fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if impairment exists if impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value 

goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a twostep quantitative test the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill the company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a twostep quantitative impairment test fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value goodwill is considered impaired the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the “implied” fair value which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination 

29   

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates weighted average cost of capital and assumed royalty rates if the fair value is less than the carrying value the asset is reduced to fair value 

as of august 3 2014  the carrying value of goodwill was 2433 million  as of august 3 2014  goodwill related to the acquisitions in 2013 and 2014 was as follows bolthouse farms  692 million  plum  128 million  and kelsen  140 million  as of the 2014 measurement the estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value excluding the 2013 and 2014 acquisitions holding all other assumptions used in the 2014 fair value measurement constant a 100basispoint increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit excluding the 2013 and 2014 acquisitions to be in excess of the fair value within the acquisitions the fair value exceeded the carrying value of reporting units by at least 4 and as a result holding all other assumptions used in the 2014 fair value measurement constant a 100basispoint increase in the weighted average cost of capital would result in the carrying value to be in excess of the fair value the fair value was based on significant management assumptions if assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline potential impairment charges could result 

as of august 3 2014  the carrying value of indefinitelived trademarks was 957 million  as of august 3 2014  trademarks related to the acquisitions in 2013 and 2014 were as follows bolthouse farms  383 million plum  115 million and kelsen  147 million holding all other assumptions used in the 2014 measurement constant a 100basispoint increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of trademarks and result in an impairment charge of approximately 25 million 

in the fourth quarter of 2013 as part of the companys annual review of intangible assets an impairment charge of 360 million  was recorded on goodwill and 36 million  on trademarks for the simple meals business in europe the impairment was attributable to a combination of factors including the existence of a firm offer to purchase the business a revised future outlook for the business with reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows given the economic uncertainty in the region future investments required to maintain performance and managements assumptions on the weighted average cost of capital on august 12 2013 the company announced that it was in final and exclusive negotiations for the potential sale of this business the company has reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all years presented the business was historically included in the international simple meals and beverages segment the assets and liabilities have been reflected in assets and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of july 28 2013 on october 28 2013 the company completed the sale of its european simple meals business see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on discontinued operations 

in 2012 as part of the company’s annual review of intangible assets an impairment charge of 3 million  was recognized related to a trademark used in the european simple meals business formerly included in the international simple meals and beverages segment the trademark was determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brand resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows in comparison to the prior year 

the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance economic conditions market conditions and cost of capital inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond the company’s control such as capital markets the actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions

pension and postretirement benefits — the company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care trend rates independent actuaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states perform the required calculations to determine expense actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods 

the discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal yearend measurement date in establishing the discount rate the company reviews published market indices of highquality debt securities adjusted as appropriate for duration in addition independent actuaries apply highquality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans the expected return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering the company’s current and projected investment mix this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation longterm projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets the value of plan assets used in the calculation of pension expense is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20 of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date if the net gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year 

net periodic pension and postretirement expense was 109 million  in 2014 130 million  in 2013 and 102 million  in 2012 

30   

significant weightedaverage assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows 



estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows a 50basispoint reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 12 million a 50basispoint reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 12 million a onepercentagepoint increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately 1 million 

net periodic pension and postretirement expense is expected to decrease to approximately 75 million in 2015 the reduction is primarily due to pension settlement charges of 22 million  recognized in 2014 associated with a us pension plan the settlements resulted from the level of lump sum distributions from the plans assets in 2014 primarily due to the closure of the facility in sacramento california 

the company contributed 35 million  75 million  and 55 million  respectively to us pension plans in 2014 2013 and 2012 contributions to nonus plans were 12 million  in 2014 and 2013 and 16 million  in 2012 the company does not expect to contribute to the us pension plans in 2015 contributions to nonus plans are expected to be approximately 6 million  in 2015

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company currently deems immaterial also may impair the company’s business operations and financial condition 

the company operates in a highly competitive industry 

the company operates in the highly competitive food industry and experiences international competition in all of its principal products the principal areas of competition are brand recognition taste quality price advertising promotion convenience and service a number of the companys primary competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources a strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to the companys marketplace efforts or a consumer shift towards private label offerings could result in the company reducing pricing increasing marketing or other expenditures andor losing market share 

the companys results are dependent on successful marketplace initiatives and   acceptance by consumers of the companys products including new or improved product and packaging introductions 

the companys results are dependent on successful marketplace initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the companys products the companys new or improved product and packaging introductions along with its other marketplace initiatives are designed to capitalize on customer or consumer trends in order to remain successful the company must anticipate and react to these trends and develop new or improved products or packaging to address them while the company devotes significant resources to meeting this goal the company may not be successful in developing new or improved products or packaging or its new or improved products or packaging may not be accepted by customers or consumers 

the companys results may be adversely affected by the failure to execute acquisitions and divestitures successfully 

the companys ability to meet its objectives with respect to the acquisition of new businesses or the divestiture of existing businesses may depend in part on its ability to identify suitable buyers and sellers negotiate favorable financial terms and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals potential risks of acquisitions also include the inability to integrate acquired businesses efficiently into the companys existing operations diversion of managements attention from other business concerns potential loss of key employees andor customers of acquired businesses potential assumption of unknown liabilities potential disputes with the sellers potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline and the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which the company has limited or no prior experience acquisitions outside the us may present unique challenges and increase the companys exposure to risks associated with foreign operations including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes for divestitures potential risks may also include the inability to separate divested businesses or business units from the company effectively and efficiently and to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs the companys business or financial results may be negatively affected if acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed 

disruption to the companys supply chain could adversely affect its business 

the companys ability to manufacture andor sell its products may be impaired by damage or disruption to its manufacturing or distribution capabilities or to the capabilities of its suppliers or contract manufacturers as a result of adverse weather conditions such as drought temperature extremes or floods natural disasters fire terrorism pandemics strikes or other events production of carrots by the companys bolthouse farms business may be also be adversely affected by water scarcity crop disease and crop pests failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur may adversely affect the companys business or financial results particularly in circumstances where a product is sourced from a single supplier or location disputes with significant suppliers or contract manufacturers including disputes regarding pricing or performance may also adversely affect the companys ability to manufacture andor sell its products as well as its business or financial results 

the companys nonus operations pose additional risks to the companys business 

in 2013 approximately 23 of the companys consolidated net sales from continuing operations were generated outside of the us sales outside the us are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of consolidated net sales the companys business or financial performance may be adversely affected due to the risks of doing business in markets outside of the us including but not limited to the following 

  

 6   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the company holds assets and incurs liabilities generates revenue and pays expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the australian dollar and the canadian dollar the companys consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars and the company must translate its assets liabilities sales and expenses into us dollars for external reporting purposes as a result changes in the value of the us dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in the companys consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their local currency 

the company faces risks related to recession financial and credit market disruptions   and other economic conditions 

customer and consumer demand for the companys products may be impacted by weak economic conditions recession equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the us or other nations similarly disruptions in financial andor credit markets may impact the companys ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its customers suppliers and creditors in addition changes in tax or interest rates in the us or other nations whether due to recession financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons could impact the company 

increased regulation could adversely affect the companys business or financial results 

the manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated the primary areas of regulation include the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of the companys food products as well as the health and safety of the companys employees and the protection of the environment in the us the company is subject to regulation by various government agencies including the food and drug administration the us department of agriculture the federal trade commission the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies the company is also regulated by similar agencies outside the us and by voluntary organizations such as the national advertising division and the childrens food and beverage advertising initiative of the council of better business bureaus changes in regulatory requirements or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance cost capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect the companys business or financial results 

the companys results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and   packaging materials 

the raw and packaging materials used in the companys business include tomato paste grains beef poultry vegetables steel glass paper and resin many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations weather conditions including the potential effects of climate change import and export requirements and changes in governmentsponsored agricultural programs to the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and packaging material prices the company may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases or through its commodity hedging activity 

price increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs or may result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in the marketplace 

the company intends to pass along to customers some or all cost increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs through increases in the selling prices of some of its products higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume to the extent the price increases are not sufficient to offset increased raw and packaging materials and other input costs andor if they result in significant decreases in sales volume the companys business results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the company may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of its customers 

in recent years alternative retail grocery channels such as dollar stores drug stores and club stores have increased their market share this trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future in addition consolidations in the traditional retail grocery trade have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek lower prices or increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers these customers may use more of their 

7   

shelf space for their private label products if the company is unable to use its scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics the companys business or financial results could be negatively impacted also during 2013 the companys five largest customers accounted for approximately 36  of the companys consolidated net sales with the largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounting for approximately 19  of the companys consolidated net sales the disruption of sales to any of these customers or to any of the companys other large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect the companys business or financial results 

the company may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to   its defined benefit pension plans 

the company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans for employees in the us and various nonus locations the major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets investment returns interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of the companys defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet a significant increase in the companys obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company 

the company may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in or security breaches of its   information technology systems 

each year the company engages in several billion dollars of transactions with its customers and vendors because the amount of dollars involved is so significant the companys information technology resources some of which are managed by third parties must provide connections among its marketing sales manufacturing logistics customer service and accounting functions if the company does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain an appropriate technology infrastructure and to maintain the related computerized and manual control processes the companys business or financial results could be negatively impacted furthermore the companys information technology systems may be vulnerable to security breaches including the theft of customer consumer or other confidential data cyberbased attacks or other system failures if the company is unable to prevent such failures the companys business or financial results could be negatively impacted

significant accounting estimates 

the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions 

trade and consumer promotion programs — the company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers such as feature price discounts instore display incentives cooperative advertising programs new product introduction fees and coupons the mix between promotion programs which are classified as reductions in revenue and advertising or other marketing activities which are classified as marketing and selling expenses fluctuates between periods based on the company’s overall marketing plans and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues the measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors typically programs that are offered have a very short duration historically the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements however actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates 

valuation of longlived assets — fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value 

goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a twostep quantitative test the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill the company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a twostep quantitative impairment test fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value goodwill is considered impaired the amount of the 

27   

impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the “implied” fair value which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination 

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates weighted average cost of capital and assumed royalty rates if the fair value is less than the carrying value the asset is reduced to fair value 

in the fourth quarter of 2013 as part of the companys annual review of intangible assets an impairment charge of 360 million was recorded on goodwill and 36 million on trademarks for the simple meals business in europe the impairment was attributable to a combination of factors including the existence of a firm offer to purchase the business a revised future outlook for the business with reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows given the economic uncertainty in the region future investments required to maintain performance and managements assumptions on the weighted average cost of capital 

on august 12 2013 the company announced that it was in final and exclusive negotiations for the potential sale of this business the company has reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all years presented the business was historically included in the international simple meals and beverages segment the assets and liabilities have been reflected in assets and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of july 28 2013 

as of july 28 2013  the carrying value of goodwill was 2407 billion of which 110 million relates to the european simple meals business and has been included in assets held for sale prior to the impairment charge in 2013 the company had not recognized any impairment of goodwill as a result of annual testing which began in 2003 as of the 2013  measurement the estimated fair value of each reporting unit of continuing operations exceeded the carrying value by at least 40 excluding the 2013 acquisitions holding all other assumptions used in the 2013  fair value measurement constant a 100basispoint increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit to be in excess of the fair value as of july 28 2013 goodwill related to the acquisition of bolthouse farms and plum was 692 million and 128 million respectively within bolthouse the fair value exceeded the carrying value by at least 15 because the plum acquisition closed on june 13 2013 the carrying value represents fair value 

as of july 28 2013  the carrying value of trademarks was 960 million of which 150 million relates to the european simple meals business and has been included in assets held for sale holding all other assumptions used in the 2013  measurement constant a 100basispoint increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of trademarks of continuing operations excluding the 2013 acquisitions but would not result in an impairment charge as of july 28 2013 trademarks related to the acquisition of bolthouse farms and plum were 383 million and 115 million respectively 

in 2012 as part of the company’s annual review of intangible assets an impairment charge of 3 million  was recognized related to a trademark used in the european simple meals business formerly included in the international simple meals and beverages segment the trademark was determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brand resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows in comparison to the prior year 

the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance economic conditions market conditions and cost of capital inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond the company’s control such as capital markets the actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions

pension and postretirement benefits — the company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care trend rates independent actuaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states perform the required calculations to determine expense actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods 

the discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal yearend measurement date in establishing the discount rate the company reviews published market indices of highquality debt securities adjusted as appropriate for duration in addition independent actuaries apply highquality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans the expected return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering the company’s current and projected investment mix this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation longterm projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets the value of plan assets used in the calculation of pension expense is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20 of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are 

28   

determined at each measurement date if the net gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year 

net periodic pension and postretirement expense was 130 million in 2013 102 million in 2012 and 98 million in 2011 

significant weightedaverage assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows 



estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows a 50basispoint reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 14 million a 50basispoint reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 12 million a onepercentagepoint increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately 1 million 

net periodic pension and postretirement expense is expected to decrease to approximately 90 million in 2014 primarily due to decreased amortization of unrecognized losses as a result of an increase in the discount rate 

the company contributed 75 million  55 million  and 100 million  respectively to us pension plans in 2013 2012 and 2011 contributions to nonus plans were 12 million  in 2013 16 million  in 2012 and 44 million  in 2011 the company contributed 35 million to us plans in the first quarter of 2014 additional contributions to us plans are not expected in 2014 contributions to nonus plans are expected to be approximately 18 million  in 2014

income taxes — the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized

the companys results are dependent on successful marketplace initiatives and   acceptance by consumers of the companys products including new or improved product and packaging introductions 

the companys results are dependent on successful marketplace initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the companys products the companys new or improved product and packaging introductions along with its other marketplace initiatives are designed to capitalize on customer or consumer trends in order to remain successful the company must anticipate and react to these trends and develop new or improved products or packaging to address them while the company devotes significant resources to meeting this goal the company may not be successful in developing new or improved products or packaging or its new or improved products or packaging may not be accepted by customers or consumers 

disruption to the companys supply chain could adversely affect its business 

damage or disruption to the companys manufacturing or distribution capabilities or to the capabilities of the companys suppliers or contract manufacturers whether as a result of adverse weather conditions such as drought temperature extremes or floods natural disaster fire terrorism pandemic strikes or other events could impair the companys ability to manufacture andor sell its products in addition as part of the bolthouse farms acquisition the company acquired a significant us producer of fresh carrots the production of carrots may be adversely impacted by the events listed above as well as by water scarcity crop disease and crop pests failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single location could adversely affect the companys business or financial results 

the company faces risks related to recession financial and credit market disruptions   and other economic conditions 

customer and consumer demand for the companys products may be impacted by weak economic conditions recession equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the us or other nations similarly disruptions in financial andor credit markets may impact the companys ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its customers suppliers and creditors in addition changes in tax or interest rates in the us or other nations whether due to recession financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons could impact the company 

the company may be adversely impacted by the failure to execute   acquisitions and divestitures successfully 

from time to time the company undertakes acquisitions such as the bolthouse farms acquisition or divestitures the success of any such acquisition or divestiture depends in part upon the companys ability to identify suitable buyers or sellers negotiate favorable contractual terms and in many cases obtain governmental approval for acquisitions success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into the companys existing operations successfully managing new risks associated with the acquired business and achieving expected returns and other benefits acquisitions outside the us may present unique challenges or increase the companys exposure to risks associated with foreign operations including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes for divestitures success is also dependent on effectively and efficiently separating the divested unit or business from the company and reducing or eliminating associated overhead costs in cases where acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed the companys business or financial results could be negatively impacted 

increased regulation could adversely affect the companys business or financial results 

the manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated the primary areas of regulation include the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of the companys food products as well as the health and safety of the companys employees and the protection of the environment in the us the company is subject to regulation by various government agencies including the food and drug administration the us department of agriculture the federal trade commission the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency as well 

as various state and local agencies the company is also regulated by similar agencies outside the us and by voluntary organizations such as the national advertising division and the childrens food and beverage advertising initiative of the council of better business bureaus changes in regulatory requirements such as proposed requirements designed to restrict food marketing or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance cost capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect the companys business or financial results 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect the companys   results 

the company holds assets and incurs liabilities generates revenue and pays expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the australian dollar canadian dollar and the euro the companys consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars and therefore the company must translate its assets liabilities sales and expenses into us dollars for external reporting purposes as a result changes in the value of the us dollar may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in the companys consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

the companys results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and   packaging materials 

the raw and packaging materials used in the companys business include tomato paste grains beef poultry vegetables steel glass paper and resin many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations weather conditions including the potential effects of climate change import and export requirements and changes in governmentsponsored agricultural programs to the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and packaging material prices the company may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases or through its commodity hedging activity 

price increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs or may result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in the marketplace 

the company intends to pass along to customers some or all cost increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs through increases in the selling prices of some of its products higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume to the extent the price increases are not sufficient to offset increased raw and packaging materials and other input costs andor if they result in significant decreases in sales volume the companys business results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the company may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of its customers 

in recent years alternative retail grocery channels such as dollar stores drug stores and club stores have increased their market share this trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future in addition consolidations in the traditional retail grocery trade have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek lower prices or increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers these customers may use more of their shelf space for their private label products if the company is unable to use its scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics the companys business or financial results could be negatively impacted also during 2012 the companys five largest customers accounted for approximately 34  of the companys consolidated net sales with the largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounting for approximately 17  of the companys consolidated net sales the disruption of sales to any of these customers or to any of the companys other large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect the companys business or financial results 

the company may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to   its defined benefit pension plans 

the company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans for employees in the us and various nonus locations the major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets investment returns interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of the companys defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet a significant increase in the companys obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company 

the company may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in or security breaches of its   information technology systems 

each year the company engages in several billion dollars of transactions with its customers and vendors because the amount of dollars involved is so significant the companys information technology resources some of which are managed by third parties must provide connections among its marketing sales manufacturing logistics customer service and accounting functions if the company does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain an appropriate technology infrastructure and to maintain the related computerized and manual control processes the companys business or financial results could be negatively impacted furthermore the companys information technology systems may be vulnerable to security breaches including the theft of customer consumer or other confidential data cyberbased attacks or other system failures if the company is unable to prevent such failures the companys business or financial results could be negatively impacted 

the company may not properly execute or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits   from its ongoing supply chain information technology or other initiatives 

the companys success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from its ongoing supply chain information technology and other initiatives these initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient in the manufacture and distribution of its products which is necessary in the companys highly competitive industry these initiatives are often complex and a failure to implement them properly may in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits result in an interruption to the companys sales manufacturing logistics customer service or accounting functions 

the companys results may be impacted negatively by political conditions in the countries where the company does business 

the company has operations or does business in multiple countries because of its international reach the companys performance may be impacted negatively by politically motivated factors such as unfavorable changes in tariffs or export and import restrictions in these countries the company may also be impacted by political instability civil disobedience armed hostilities and terrorist acts in these countries 

if the companys food products become adulterated or are mislabeled the company   might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if   consumers are injured 

the company may need to recall some of its products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled the company may also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes injury a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time the company could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against it a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to the companys reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the companys products in addition the companys results could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the companys products ingredients or packaging even in the absence of a recall or a product liability case 

the companys results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of its brands 

the company has a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of the companys business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on the companys ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that the company has acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about the companys products whether or not valid the companys failure to maintain the quality of its products the failure of the companys products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about the company its brands or products on social or digital media could seriously damage the companys brands and reputation if the company does not maintain the favorable perception of its brands the companys results could be negatively impacted

an analysis of operating earnings by segment follows 



 

 earnings from us simple meals in 2012  and 2011  were comparable as earnings gains in us soup were mostly offset by declines in us sauces for the segment higher selling prices productivity improvements and lower promotional spending were mostly offset by lower volumes and cost inflation 

earnings from us simple meals decreased   11  in 2011  versus 2010  the decline was primarily due to lower sales and a reduced gross margin percentage partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses in the first half of 2011  in response to the overall competitive environment the company maintained higher levels of promotional support which did not deliver anticipated volume gains 

earnings from global baking and snacking decreased   11  in 2012  versus 2011  primarily due to cost inflation increased promotional spending and higher advertising expense partly offset by higher selling prices and productivity improvements promotional spending was increased to support the businesses 

earnings from global baking and snacking increased   10  in 2011  versus 2010  the increase was primarily due to the impact of currency and volumedriven growth in both pepperidge farm and arnott’s 

earnings from international simple meals and beverages decreased   17  in 2012  versus 2011  the decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to lower earnings in the asia pacific region and canada and increased costs associated with the companys market expansion in china 

earnings from international simple meals and beverages increased  15 in 2011  versus 2010  the increase was primarily due to growth in the asia pacific region the impact of currency and reduced investment in russia 

earnings from us beverages decreased   26  primarily due to cost inflation increased promotional spending and advertising expense partly offset by productivity improvements 

earnings from us beverages decreased   12  in 2011  versus 2010  primarily due to increased promotional spending 

earnings from north america foodservice increased   4  due to higher selling prices and productivity improvements partially offset by cost inflation 

earnings from north america foodservice increased  to 82 million  in 2011  from 55 million  in 2010  primarily due to reduced promotional spending productivity improvements in excess of inflation and lower administrative expense 

interest expenseincome 

interest expense decreased  to 114 million  in 2012  from 122 million  in 2011  primarily due to lower interest rates on fixedrate debt interest income decreased  to 8 million  in 2012  from 11 million  in 2011  primarily due to lower levels of cash and cash equivalents 

interest expense increased to 122 million  in 2011  from 112 million  in 2010  primarily due to an increase in fixedrate debt and higher debt levels interest income increased  to 11 million  in 2011  from 6 million  in 2010  primarily due to higher levels of cash and cash equivalents 

taxes on earnings 

the effective tax rate was 309  in 2012  313  in 2011  and 320  in 2010  the reduction in the effective tax rate in 2012  from 2011  was primarily due to lower tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2012 

the reduction in the effective tax rate in 2011  from 2010  was primarily due to 10 million of deferred tax expense recognized in 2010 as a result of the enactment of us health care legislation the law changed the tax treatment of subsidies to companies that provide prescription drug benefits to retirees the company recorded the adjustment to reduce the value of the deferred tax asset associated with the subsidy

significant accounting estimates 

the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions 

trade and consumer promotion programs — the company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers such as feature price discounts instore display incentives cooperative advertising programs new product introduction fees and coupons the mix between promotion programs which are classified as reductions in revenue and advertising or other marketing activities which are classified as marketing and selling expenses fluctuates between periods based on the company’s overall marketing plans and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues the measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors typically programs that are offered have a very short duration historically the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly 

or annual financial statements however actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates 

valuation of longlived assets — fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value 

goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a twostep quantitative test the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill the company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a twostep quantitative impairment test fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value goodwill is considered impaired the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the “implied” fair value which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination as of july 29 2012  the carrying value of goodwill was 2013 billion  the company has not recognized any impairment of goodwill as a result of annual testing which began in 2003 as of the 2012  measurement the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by at least 45 holding all other assumptions used in the 2012  measurement constant a 100basispoint increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit to be in excess of the fair value 

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates weighted average cost of capital and assumed royalty rates if the fair value is less than the carrying value the asset is reduced to fair value as of july 29 2012  the carrying value of trademarks was 485 million in 2012  as part of the company’s annual review of intangible assets an impairment charge of 3 million  was recognized related to the blå band  trademark used in the international simple meals and beverages segment the trademark was determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brand resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows in comparison to the prior year as of july 29 2012  certain european trademarks have a carrying value of approximately 40 million  which approximates fair value holding all other assumptions used in the 2012  measurement constant a 100basispoint increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of all trademarks and result in an impairment charge of approximately 6 million  in 2011 as part of the company’s annual review of intangible assets an impairment charge of 3 million  was recognized related to the heisse tasse  trademark used in the international simple meals and beverages segment the trademark was determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brand resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows in comparison to the prior year 

the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance economic conditions market conditions and cost of capital inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond the company’s control such as capital markets the actual cash flows could differ from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions 

see also note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets 

pension and postretirement benefits — the company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care trend rates independent actuaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states perform the required calculations to determine expense actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods 

the discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal yearend measurement date in establishing the discount rate the company reviews published market indices of highquality debt securities adjusted as appropriate for duration in addition independent actuaries apply highquality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans the expected return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering the company’s current and projected investment mix this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation longterm projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets the value of plan assets used in the calculation of pension expense is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20 of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date if the net gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion is 

amortized into earnings in the following year 

net periodic pension and postretirement expense was 102 million  in 2012  98 million  in 2011  and 92 million  in 2010  the 2010 expense included 12 million of pension settlement costs related to the closure of a plant in canada significant weightedaverage assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows 



estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows a 50basispoint reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 18 million a 50basispoint reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 12 million a onepercentagepoint increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately 1 million  

net periodic pension and postretirement expense is expected to increase to approximately 128 million in 2013 primarily due to increased amortization of unrecognized losses 

the company contributed 55 million  and 100 million  respectively to us pension plans in 2012  and 2011  given the adverse impact of declining financial markets on the funding levels of the plans the company contributed 260 million  to a us plan in 2010 contributions to nonus plans were 16 million  in 2012  44 million  in 2011  and 24 million  in 2010  the company contributed 75 million  to us plans in the first quarter of 2013 additional contributions to us plans are not expected in 2013 contributions to nonus plans are expected to be approximately 13 million  in 2013

goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value a reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value goodwill is considered impaired the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the “implied” fair value which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination as of july 31 2011 the carrying value of goodwill was 2133 billion the company has not recognized any impairment of goodwill as a result of annual testing which began in 2003 as of the 2011 measurement the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by at least 80 holding all other assumptions used in the 2011 measurement constant a 100basispoint increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit to be in excess of the fair value 

 

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates weighted average cost of capital and assumed royalty rates if the fair value is less than the carrying value the asset is reduced to fair value as of july 31 2011 the carrying value of trademarks was 515 million in 2011 as part of the company’s annual review of intangible assets an impairment charge of 3 million was recognized related to the heisse tasse trademark used in the international simple meals and beverages segment the trademark was determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brand resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows in comparison to the prior year as of july 31 2011 certain european trademarks have a carrying value of approximately 100 million which approximates fair value holding all other assumptions used in the 2011 measurement constant a 100basispoint increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of all trademarks and result in an impairment charge of approximately 21 million in 2009 as part of the company’s annual review of intangible assets an impairment charge of 67 million was recognized related to certain european trademarks used in the international simple meals and beverages segment including heisse tasse  blå band and royco  the trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands resulting from reduced expectations for discounted cash flows in comparison to prior year the reduction was due in part to a deterioration in market conditions and an increase in the weighted average cost of capital see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets 

 

the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance economic conditions market conditions and cost of capital inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond the company’s control such as capital markets the actual cash flows could differ from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions 

 

pension and postretirement benefits  — the company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care trend rates independent actuaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states perform the required calculations to determine expense actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods 

 

the discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal yearend measurement date in establishing the discount rate the company reviews published market indices of highquality debt securities adjusted as appropriate for duration in addition independent actuaries apply highquality bond yield curves to the expected benefit 

  payments of the plans the expected return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering the company’s current and projected investment mix this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation longterm projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets the value of plan assets used in the calculation of pension expense is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20 of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date if the net gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year 

 

net periodic pension and postretirement expense was 98 million in 2011 92 million in 2010 and 53 million in 2009 the 2010 expense included 12 million of pension settlement costs related to the closure of a plant in canada significant weightedaverage assumptions as of the end of the year are as follows 

 

 

 

estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows a 50basispoint reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 14 million a 50basispoint reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 12 million a onepercentagepoint increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately 1 million 

 

net periodic pension and postretirement expense is expected to increase to approximately 103 million in 2012 primarily due to increased amortization of unrecognized losses 

 

the company contributed 100 million to us pension plans in 2011 given the adverse impact of declining financial markets on the funding levels of the plans the company contributed 260 million to a us plan in 2010 contributions to nonus plans were 44 million in 2011 24 million in 2010 and 13 million in 2009 the company contributed 55 million to us plans in the first quarter of 2012 additional contributions to us plans are not expected in 2012 contributions to nonus plans are expected to be approximately 10 million in 2012

income taxes  — the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized

the company faces risks related to recession financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions

increased regulation could adversely affect the company’s business or financial results 

 

the manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated the primary areas of regulation include the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of the company’s food products as well as the health and safety of the company’s employees and the protection of the environment in the united states the company is subject to regulation by various government agencies including the food and drug administration the us department of agriculture the federal trade commission the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies the company is also regulated by similar agencies outside the united states and by voluntary organizations such as the national advertising division and the children’s food and beverage advertising initiative of the council of better business bureaus changes in regulatory requirements such as proposed requirements designed to enhance food safety or restrict food marketing or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance cost capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect the company’s business or financial results 

 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect the company’s results 

 

the company holds assets and incurs liabilities earns revenue and pays expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the australian dollar canadian dollar and the euro the company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars and therefore the company must translate its assets liabilities revenue and expenses into us dollars for external reporting purposes as a result changes in the value of the us dollar may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in the company’s consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

 

the company’s results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and packaging materials 

 

the raw and packaging materials used in the company’s business include tomato paste grains beef poultry vegetables steel glass paper and resin many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including product scarcity demand for raw materials commodity market speculation energy costs currency fluctuations weather conditions including the potential effects of climate change import and export requirements and changes in governmentsponsored agricultural programs to the extent any of these factors result 

in an increase in raw and packaging material prices the company may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases or through its commodity hedging activity 

 

the company’s results are dependent on successful marketplace initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the company’s products 

 

the company’s results are dependent on successful marketplace initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the company’s products the company’s product introductions and product improvements along with its other marketplace initiatives are designed to capitalize on customer or consumer trends in order to remain successful the company must anticipate and react to these trends and develop new products or processes to address them while the company devotes significant resources to meeting this goal the company may not be successful in developing new products or processes or its new products or processes may not be accepted by customers or consumers 

 

the company may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to its defined benefit pension plans 

 

the company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations the major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets investment returns interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of the company’s defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet a significant increase in the company’s obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company 

 

the company may be adversely impacted by the increased significance of some of its customers 

 

the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek lower prices or increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for the company’s products for their private label products if the company is unable to use its scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer initiatives the company’s business or financial results could be negatively impacted in addition the disruption of sales to any of the company’s large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect the company’s business or financial results 

 

the company may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in or failure of its information technology systems 

 

each year the company engages in several billion dollars of transactions with its customers and vendors because the amount of dollars involved is so significant the company’s information technology resources must provide connections among its marketing sales manufacturing logistics customer service and accounting functions if the company does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain an appropriate technology infrastructure and to maintain the related computerized and manual control processes the company’s business or financial results could be negatively impacted 

 

the company may not properly execute or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from its ongoing supply chain information technology or other initiatives 

 

the company’s success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from its ongoing supply chain information technology and other initiatives these initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient in the manufacture and distribution of its products which is necessary in the company’s highly competitive industry these initiatives are often complex and a failure to implement them properly may in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits result in an interruption to the company’s sales manufacturing logistics customer service or accounting functions 

disruption to the company’s supply chain could adversely affect its business 

 

damage or disruption to the company’s suppliers or to the company’s manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather natural disaster fire terrorism pandemic strikes or other reasons could impair the company’s ability to manufacture andor sell its products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single location could adversely affect the company’s business or financial results 

 

the company may be adversely impacted by the failure to execute acquisitions and divestitures successfully 

 

from time to time the company undertakes acquisitions or divestitures the success of any such acquisition or divestiture depends in part upon the company’s ability to identify suitable buyers or sellers negotiate favorable contractual terms and in many cases obtain governmental approval for acquisitions success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into the company’s existing operations successfully managing new risks associated with the acquired business and achieving expected returns and other benefits acquisitions outside the united states may present unique challenges or increase the company’s exposure to risks associated with foreign operations including foreign currency risks and the risks of complying with foreign regulations finally for acquisitions the company may incur substantial additional indebtedness which could adversely impact its credit rating in cases where acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed the company’s business or financial results could be negatively impacted 

 

the company’s results may be impacted negatively by political conditions in the nations where the company does business

significant accounting estimates 

 

the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions 

 

trade and consumer promotion programs  — the company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers such as cooperative advertising programs feature price discounts instore display incentives and coupons the recognition of the costs for these programs which are classified as a reduction of revenue involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates estimates are made based 

on historical experience and other factors actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from estimates 

 

valuation of longlived assets  — fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value 

 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested at least annually for impairment or as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 

 

goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value goodwill is considered impaired the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the “implied” fair value which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination as of august 1 2010 the carrying value of goodwill was 1919 billion the company has not recognized any impairment of goodwill as a result of annual testing which began in 2003 as of the 2010 measurement the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by at least 80 holding all other assumptions used in the 2010 measurement constant a 100basispoint increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit to be in excess of the fair value 

 

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital and assumed royalty rates if the fair value is less than the carrying value the asset is reduced to fair value as of august 1 2010 the carrying value of trademarks was 496 million holding all other assumptions used in the 2010 measurement constant a 100basispoint increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of trademarks and result in an impairment charge of approximately 13 million in 2009 as part of the company’s annual review of intangible assets an impairment charge of 67 million was recognized related to certain european trademarks primarily in germany and the nordic region used in the international soup sauces and beverages segment the trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands resulting from reduced expectations for discounted cash flows in comparison to prior year the reduction was due in part to a deterioration in market conditions and an increase in the weighted average cost of capital see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets 

 

the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance economic conditions market conditions and cost of capital assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning however inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond the company’s control such as capital markets the actual cash flows could differ from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions 

 

pension and postretirement benefits  — the company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care trend rates independent actuaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states perform the required calculations to determine expense actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods 

 

the discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal yearend measurement date in establishing the discount rate the company reviews published market indices of highquality debt securities adjusted as appropriate for duration in addition independent actuaries apply highquality bond yield curves to the expected benefit 

payments of the plans the expected return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering the company’s current and projected investment mix this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation longterm projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets the value of plan assets used in the calculation of pension expense is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20 of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date if the net gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year 

 

net periodic pension and postretirement expense was 92 million in 2010 53 million in 2009 and 54 million in 2008 the 2010 expense included 12 million of pension settlement costs related to the closure of a plant in canada the 2008 expense included 2 million of special termination benefits and curtailment costs related to the godiva divestiture which was recorded in discontinued operations the 2008 expense also included 4 million of special termination and curtailment costs related to the restructuring initiatives significant weightedaverage assumptions as of the end of the year are as follows 

 

 

 

estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 12 million a 50 basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 10 million a one percentage point increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately 1 million 

 

net periodic pension and postretirement expense is expected to increase to approximately 100 million in 2011 primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate for benefit obligations and increased amortization of unrecognized losses 

 

given the adverse impact of declining financial markets on the funding levels of the plans the company contributed 260 million to a us plan in 2010 the company made a voluntary contribution of 70 million in 2008 to a us plan contributions to international plans were 24 million in 2010 13 million in 2009 and 8 million in 2008 the company contributed 100 million to us plans in the first quarter of 2011 additional contributions to us plans are not expected in 2011 contributions to nonus plans are expected to be approximately 43 million in 2011

income taxes  — the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 

at the beginning of fiscal 2008 the company adopted revised accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes upon adoption the company recognized a cumulativeeffect adjustment of 6 million as an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties and a reduction in retained earnings prior to the adoption tax reserves were established to reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies as of august 1 2010 the liability for unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties was 45 million

significant accounting estimates 

 

the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions 

 

trade and consumer promotion programs  — the company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers such as cooperative advertising programs feature price discounts instore display incentives and coupons the recognition of the costs for these programs which are classified as a reduction of revenue involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from estimates 

 

valuation of longlived assets  — fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value 

 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested at least annually for impairment or as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 

 

goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates operating margins weighted 

average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value goodwill is considered impaired the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the “implied” fair value which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination as of august 2 2009 the carrying value of goodwill was 1901 billion the company has not recognized any impairment of goodwill as a result of annual testing which began in 2003 as of the 2009 measurement the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by at least 30 holding all other assumptions used in the 2009 measurement constant a 100basispoint increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit to be in excess of the fair value 

 

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital and assumed royalty rates if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the asset is reduced to fair value in 2009 as part of the company’s annual review of intangible assets an impairment charge of 67 million was recognized related to certain european trademarks primarily in germany and the nordic region used in the international soup sauces and beverages segment the trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands resulting from reduced expectations for discounted cash flows in comparison to prior year the reduction was due in part to a deterioration in market conditions and an increase in the weighted average cost of capital as of august 2 2009 the carrying value of trademarks was 508 million holding all other assumptions used in the 2009 measurement constant the estimated impact of a 100basispoint increase in the weighted average cost of capital would be a reduction in the carrying value of trademarks of approximately 10 million see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets 

 

the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance economic conditions market conditions and cost of capital assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning however inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond the company’s control such as capital markets the actual cash flows could differ from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions 

 

pension and postretirement benefits  — the company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care trend rates independent actuaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states perform the required calculations to determine expense actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods 

 

the discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal yearend measurement date in establishing the discount rate the company reviews published market indices of highquality debt securities adjusted as appropriate for duration in addition independent actuaries apply highquality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans the expected return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering the company’s current and projected investment mix this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation longterm projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets the value of plan assets used in the calculation of pension expense is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20 of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date if the net gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year 

 

net periodic pension and postretirement expense was 53 million in 2009 54 million in 2008 and 57 million in 2007 the 2008 expense included 2 million of special termination benefits and curtailment costs related to the godiva divestiture which was recorded in discontinued operations the 2008 expense also included 4 million of 

special termination and curtailment costs related to the restructuring initiatives significant weightedaverage assumptions as of the end of the year are as follows 

 

 

 

estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 13 million a 50 basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 11 million a one percentage point increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately 1 million 

 

net periodic pension and postretirement expense is expected to increase to approximately 80 million in 2010 primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate for benefit obligations a significant decline in the fair value of plan assets and a reduction in the expected return on plan assets 

 

although there were no mandatory funding requirements to the us plans in 2009 2008 and 2007 the company made voluntary contributions of 70 million in 2008 and 22 million in 2007 to a us plan based on expected future funding requirements contributions to international plans were 13 million in 2009 8 million in 2008 and 10 million in 2007 given the adverse impact of declining financial markets on the funding levels of the plans the company contributed 260 million to a us plan in the first quarter of 2010 contributions to nonus plans are expected to be approximately 18 million in 2010 

 

as of july 29 2007 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” sfas no 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability on the balance sheet and requires any unrecognized prior service cost and actuarial gainslosses to be recognized in other comprehensive income

income taxes  — the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 

 

beginning in 2008 the tax reserves are established in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” which was adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2008 upon adoption the company recognized a cumulativeeffect adjustment of 6 million as an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties and a reduction in retained earnings prior to the adoption of fin 48 tax reserves were established to reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies as of august 2 2009 the liability for unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties was 50 million

levels interest income declined to 8 million in 2008 from 19 million in 2007 primarily due to lower levels of cash and cash equivalents

in 2007 the company also recognized an additional net benefit of 40 million following the finalization of the 20022004 us federal tax audits

trade and consumer promotion programs  — the company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers such as cooperative advertising programs feature price discounts instore display incentives and coupons the recognition of the costs for these programs which are classified as a reduction of revenue involves use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates estimates are made based on 

historical experience and other factors actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from estimates 

 

valuation of longlived assets  — longlived assets including fixed assets and intangibles are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable discounted cash flow analyses are used to assess nonamortizable intangible asset impairment while undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to assess other longlived asset impairment the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning the actual cash flows could differ from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions 

 

pension and postretirement benefits  — the company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care trend rates independent actuaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states perform the required calculations to determine expense actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods 

 

the discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal yearend measurement date in establishing the discount rate the company reviews published market indices of highquality debt securities adjusted as appropriate for duration in addition independent actuaries apply highquality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans the expected return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering the company’s current and projected investment mix this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation longterm projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets the value of plan assets used in the calculation of pension expense is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20 of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date if the net gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year 

 

net periodic pension and postretirement expense was 54 million in 2008 57 million in 2007 and 77 million in 2006 the 2008 expense included 2 million of special termination benefits and curtailment costs related to the godiva divestiture which was recorded in discontinued operations the 2008 expense also included 4 million of special termination and curtailment costs related to the restructuring initiatives significant weightedaverage assumptions as of the end of the year are as follows 

 

 

 

estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 11 million a 50 basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 10 million a one percentage point increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately 1 million 

 

although there were no mandatory funding requirements to the us plans in 2008 2007 and 2006 the company made voluntary contributions of 70 million in 2008 22 million in 2007 and 35 million in 2006 to a us plan based on expected future funding requirements contributions to international plans were 8 million in

results of operations 

2007 earnings from continuing operations were 823 million 208 per share in 2007 and 755 million 182 per share in 2006 all earnings per share amounts included in management’s discussion and analysis are presented on a diluted basis 

there were several items that impacted the comparability of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations 

 

 

the items impacting comparability are summarized below 

 

 

in addition the comparability of earnings per share from continuing operations was impacted by the use of proceeds from the sale of the united kingdom and ireland businesses in the first quarter of 2007 during the first quarter of 2007 the company completed its previously announced program utilizing 620 million of the net proceeds to repurchase shares the pro forma impact on 2006 of utilizing those proceeds to repurchase 17 million shares based on the average stock price in the first quarter and reduce shares outstanding in the calculation of earnings per share from continuing operations would have resulted in a 07 increase in earnings per share from continuing operations 

the remaining increase in earnings from continuing operations in 2007 from 2006 was primarily due to an increase in sales a higher gross margin as a percentage of sales and lower net interest expense partially offset by increased marketing expenses and a higher effective tax rate 

2006 earnings from continuing operations were 755 million 182 per share in 2006 and 644 million 156 per share in 2005

the discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal yearend measurement date in establishing the discount rate the company reviews published market indices of highquality debt securities adjusted as appropriate for duration in addition independent actuaries apply highquality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans the expected return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering the company’s current and projected investment mix this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation longterm projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets the value of plan assets used in the calculation of pension expense is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20 of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date if the net gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year 

21 net periodic pension and postretirement expense was 57 million in 2007 77 million in 2006 and 67 million in 2005 significant weightedaverage assumptions as of the end of the year are as follows 

 

estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 11 million a 50 basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 9 million a one percentage point increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately 1 million 

although there were no mandatory funding requirements to the us plans in 2007 2006 and 2005 the company made a 22 million contribution in 2007 and a 35 million contribution in 2006 and 2005 to a us plan based on expected future funding requirements contributions to international plans were 10 million in 2007 17 million in 2006 and 26 million in 2005 subsequent to july 29 2007 the company made a 35 million voluntary contribution to a us plan in anticipation of future funding requirements contributions to nonus plans are expected to be approximately 9 million in 2008 

as of july 29 2007 the company adopted sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” sfas no 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability on the balance sheet and requires any unrecognized prior service cost and actuarial gainslosses to be recognized in other comprehensive income

income taxes the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions tax reserves are established when despite the company’s belief that tax return positions are fully supportable certain positions are subject to challenge and the 

company may not successfully defend its position these reserves as well as the related interest are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit while it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution of any particular tax matter the company believes that the reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized see also the section entitled recently issued accounting pronouncements and notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on income taxes including the impact of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109”

significant accounting estimates 

the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions see note 1 to the 

consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions 

trade and consumer promotion programs the company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers such as cooperative advertising programs feature price discounts instore display incentives and coupons the recognition of the costs for these programs which are classified as a reduction of revenue involves use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from estimates 

valuation of longlived assets longlived assets including fixed assets and intangibles are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable discounted cash flow analyses are used to assess nonamortizable intangible asset impairment while undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to assess other longlived asset impairment the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning the actual cash flows could differ from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions 

pension and postretirement medical benefits the company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care trend rates independent actuaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states perform the required calculations to determine expense actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods 

the discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal yearend measurement date in establishing the discount rate the company reviews published market indices of highquality debt securities adjusted as appropriate for duration in addition independent financial consultants apply highquality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans the expected return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering the company’s current and projected investment mix this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation longterm projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets the value of plan assets used in the calculation of pension expense is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20 of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected 

page 20 calculated method gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date if the net gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year 

when the fair value of pension plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation an additional minimum liability is recorded in other comprehensive income within shareowners’ equity as of july 30 2006 and july 31 2005 shareowners’ equity includes a minimum liability net of tax of 67 million and 238 million respectively 

net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense was 77 million in 2006 67 million in 2005 and 65 million in 2004 significant weightedaverage assumptions as of the end of the year are as follows 

 

 

estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 12 million a 50 basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 10 million a one percentage point increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately 2 million 

although there were no mandatory funding requirements to the us plans in 2006 2005 and 2004 the company made a 35 million contribution in 2006 and 2005 and a 50 million contribution in 2004 to a us plan based on expected future funding requirements contributions to international plans were 17 million in 2006 26 million in 2005 and 15 million in 2004 subsequent to july 30 2006 the company made a 22 million voluntary contribution to a us plan in anticipation of future funding requirements contributions to nonus plans are expected to be approximately 10 million in 2007 

see also note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement medical expenses 

income taxes the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions tax reserves are established when 

despite the company’s belief that tax return positions are fully supportable certain positions are subject to challenge and the company may not successfully defend its position these reserves as well as the related interest are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit while it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution of any particular tax matter the company believes that the reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized see also the section entitled recently issued accounting pronouncements and notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on income taxes including the impact of the ajca and fasb interpretation no fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in november 2004 sfas no 151 “inventory costs – an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” was issued sfas no 151 is the result of efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards sfas no 151 requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and spoilage to be recognized as currentperiod charges it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities sfas no 151 was effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 the adoption of sfas no 151 in 2006 did not have a material impact on the financial statements 

in october 2004 the ajca was signed into law the ajca provides for a deduction of 85 of certain nonus earnings that are repatriated as defined by the ajca and a phasedin tax deduction related to profits from domestic manufacturing activities in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fas 1091 and 1092 to address the accounting and disclosure requirements related to the ajca the total amount repatriated in 2006 under the ajca was 494 million and the related tax cost was 20 million in 2005 the company recorded 7 million in tax expense for 200 million of anticipated earnings to be repatriated in 2006 the company finalized its plan under the ajca and recorded tax expense of 13 million for 294 million of earnings repatriated 

page 21 in march 2005 the fasb issued fin 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations – an interpretation of fasb statement no 143” this interpretation clarifies that a conditional retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement accordingly an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated the liability should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition construction or development of the asset the company adopted fin 47 in 2006 the adoption did not have a material impact on the financial statements 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 clarifies the criteria that must be met for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation also addresses derecognition recognition of related penalties and interest classification of liabilities and disclosures of unrecognized tax benefits fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 the company is in the process of evaluating the impact of fin 48

redemption estimates estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from estimates valuation of longlived assets longlived assets including fixed assets and intangibles are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable discounted cash flow analyses are used to assess nonamortizable intangible asset impairment while undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to assess other longlived asset impairment the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning the actual cash flows could differ from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions pension and postretirement medical benefits the company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care trend rates independent actuaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states perform the required calculations to determine expense actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods the discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal yearend measurement date in establishing the discount rate the company reviews published market indices of highquality debt securities adjusted as appropriate for duration in addition independent financial consultants apply highquality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans the expected return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering the company’s current and projected investment mix this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation longterm projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets the value of plan assets used in the calculation of pension expense is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20 of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date if the net gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year

estimated sensitivities to the net periodic pension cost are as follows a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 12 million a 50 basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 8 million a one percentage point change in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately 2 million although there were no mandatory funding requirements to the us plans in 2005 and 2004 the company made 35 million and 50 million contributions respectively to a us plan based on expected future funding requirements contributions to international plans were 26 million in 2005 and 15 million in 2004 in 2003 there were no contributions to the us plans and contributions to international plans were 19 million subsequent to july 31 2005 the company made a 35 million voluntary contribution to a us plan in anticipation of future funding requirements see also note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement medical expenses income taxes the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions tax reserves are established when 

despite the company’s belief that tax return positions are fully supportable certain positions are subject to challenge and the company may not successfully defend its position these reserves as well as the related interest are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit while it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution of any particular tax matter the company believes that the reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized see also the section entitled recently issued accounting pronouncements and notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on income taxes including the impact of the american jobs creation act the ajca recently issued accounting pronouncements in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the act was signed into law the act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare part d and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retirement health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d in accordance with fasb staff position fsp fas 1061 the company elected in january 2004 to defer recognizing the effects of the act on accounting for postretirement health care plans until the fasb guidance was finalized in may 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fsp fas 1062 which provides accounting guidance to sponsors of postretirement health care plans that are impacted by the act the fsp is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june 15 2004 the company believes that certain drug benefits offered under postretirement health care plans will qualify for the subsidy under medicare part d the effects of the subsidy were factored into the 2004 annual yearend valuation the reduction in the benefit obligation attributable to past service cost was approximately 32 million and has been reflected as an actuarial gain the reduction in benefit cost for 2005 related to the act was approximately 5 million

 item 3 legal proceedings as previously reported on march 30 1998 the company effected a spinoff of several of its noncore businesses to vlasic foods international inc “vfi” vfi and several of its affiliates collectively “vlasic” commenced cases under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code on january 29 2001 in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware vlasic’s second amended joint plan of distribution under chapter 11 the “plan” was confirmed by an order of the bankruptcy court dated november 16 2001 and became effective on or about november 29 2001 the plan provides for the assignment of various causes of action allegedly belonging to the vlasic estates including claims against the company allegedly arising from the spinoff to vfb llc a limited liability company “vfb” whose membership interests are to be distributed under the plan to vlasic’s general unsecured creditors on february 19 2002 vfb commenced a lawsuit against the company and several of its subsidiaries in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging among other things fraudulent conveyance illegal dividends and breaches of fiduciary duty by vlasic directors alleged to be under the company’s control the lawsuit seeks to hold the company liable in an amount necessary to satisfy all unpaid claims against vlasic which vfb estimates in the amended complaint to be 200 million plus unspecified exemplary and punitive damages while the ultimate disposition of complex litigation is inherently difficult to assess the company believes the action is without merit and is defending the case vigorously as previously reported the company received an examination report from the internal revenue service on december 23 2002 which included a challenge to the treatment of gains and interest deductions claimed in the company’s fiscal 1995 federal income tax return relating to transactions involving government securities if the proposed adjustment were upheld it would require the company to pay a net amount of approximately 100 million in taxes accumulated interest to december 23 2002 and penalties interest will continue to accrue until the matter is resolved the company believes these transactions were properly reported on its federal income tax return in accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations in effect during the period involved and is challenging these adjustments vigorously while the outcome of proceedings of this type cannot be predicted with certainty the company believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial condition or results of operation of the company as previously reported in july 2003 the company began discussions with the wisconsin department of natural resources “wdnr” regarding certain air emissions from the company’s milwaukee wisconsin flavoring and spice mix plant these emissions may have exceeded limits established pursuant to the

17 significant accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions trade and consumer promotion program the company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers such as cooperative advertising programs feature price discounts instore display incentives and coupons the recognition of the costs for these programs which are classified as a reduction of revenue involves use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from estimates valuation of longlived assets longlived assets including fixed assets and intangibles are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable discounted cash flow analyses are used to assess nonamortizable intangible asset impairment while undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to assess other longlived asset impairment the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning the actual cash flows could differ from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions pension and postretirement medical benefits the company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care trend rates independent actuaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states perform the required calculations to determine expense actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods the discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal yearend measurement date based on highquality longterm debt securities the estimated return on plan assets is a longterm assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance considering the company’s current and projected 

investment mix within any given fiscal period significant differences may arise between the actual return and the estimated longterm return on plan assets the value of plan assets used in the calculation of pension expense is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20 of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date if the net gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of plan assets or liabilities a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year when the fair value of pension plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require a company to recognize an additional minimal liability this adjustment is recorded in other comprehensive income within shareowners’ equity as of august 1 2004 and august 3 2003 shareowners’ equity includes a minimum liability net of tax of 196 million and 210 million respectively net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense was 65 million in 2004 43 million in 2003 and 8 million in 2002 the increase in 2004 was primarily due to a lower discount rate and a reduction in the expected return on assets partially offset by the returns associated with a 50 million voluntary contribution to a us plan significant weightedaverage assumptions as of the end of the year are as follows  

estimated sensitivities to the net periodic pension cost are as follows a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 10 million a 50 basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately 9 million a one percentage point change in assumed health care costs would increase service and interest cost by approximately 2 million although there were no mandatory funding requirements to the us plans in 2004 the company made a 50 million contribution to a us plan based on expected future funding requirements contributions to international plans were 15 million in 2003 there were no contributions to the us plans and contributions to international plans were 19 million subsequent to august 1 2004 the company made a 35 million voluntary contribution to a us plan in anticipation of future funding requirements see also note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement medical expenses

company announced it had reached an agreement in principle to settle this case the district court’s order approving the settlement was issued on may 22 2003 and became effective june 23 2003 pursuant to the court’s order all claims have been dismissed and the litigation has been terminated in exchange for a payment of 35 million which was made in june 2003 the full amount of the payment was covered by insurance the settlement does not constitute an admission of fault or liability by the company or any other defendant as also previously reported on march 30 1998 the company effected a spinoff of several of its noncore businesses to vlasic foods international inc “vfi” vfi and several of its affiliates collectively “vlasic” commenced cases under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code on january 29 2001 in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware vlasic’s second amended joint plan of distribution under chapter 11 the “plan” was confirmed by an order of the bankruptcy court dated november 16 2001 and became effective on or about november 29 2001 the plan provides for the assignment of various causes of action allegedly belonging to the vlasic estates

the discovery stage and the ultimate disposition of complex litigation is inherently difficult to assess the company believes the action is without merit and is defending the case vigorously as also previously reported the company received an examination report from the internal revenue service on december 23 2002 which included a challenge to the treatment of gains and interest deductions claimed in the company’s fiscal 1995 federal income tax return relating to transactions involving government securities if the proposed adjustment were upheld it would require the company to pay a net amount of approximately 100 million in taxes accumulated interest to date and penalties interest will continue to accrue until the matter is resolved the company believes these transactions were properly reported on its federal income tax return in accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations in effect during the period involved and is challenging these adjustments vigorously while the

condition or results of operation of the company as also previously reported in april 2003 the company began discussions with the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” regarding
